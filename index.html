Compiled and edited by John Climie at the request of John Harper&#39;s brother, George. Also published as: John Harper: a hero on the Titanic, 1997--t.p. verso.</p><p>John Harper had been dead for 85 years when he changed my life dramatically. In 1997, I was in the Harper Memorial Baptist Church in Glasgow, which was renamed for their heroic first pastor, John Harper. There I met Bill Guthrie, a member of the church, who has a fantastic knowledge of Harper. Guthrie furnished me with a rare copy of the original book on Harper, church documents and related accounts from people whose families had known this heroic Scotsman. <p>My personal experience with Harper's story made me determined to pass it on to as many people as possible. This is done with the conviction that the life of John Harper is capable of leaving an indelible imprint upon all who become acquainted with his passionate passage through this world. </p><p>Harper stood as a giant of unselfishness in a world where most men are obsessed with looking out for "number one," a giant of sacrifice in a world where most men are unwilling to deprive themselves, a giant passion for souls in a world where few men possess a deep desire for the salvation of their fellowmen. </p><p>Joseph Addison, an English essayist said, "Unbounded courage and compassion...make the hero and the man complete." Harper embodied the courage and compassion that made a complete hero.</p>John Harper: A Man Of God <p>Published in 1912 The editorship of this volume has been undertaken at the request of Pastor George Harper, who has rendered most valuable assistance, and whose tender and loving tribute to the memory of his brother will be read with special interest. As the biography is composed mainly of tributes by various writers it has been impossible to avoid duplication. But it has been considered proper that the tributes should appear as written, since each contributor writes from his own standpoint. The sinking of the Titanic with its living freight has created a wail of sorrow throughout the civilized world. The idea of 1522 lives being lost through the sinking of one ship is perfectly appalling. Even after the great ship was at the bottom of the sea, the newspapers, not knowing what had taken place, were announcing that the Titanic was "absolutely unsinkable." But the forces of nature in the Polar regions had, under the keen breath of the north wind, massed themselves together, and from that ice zone came floating silently along the huge berg that ripped the steamer's bottom and sent it to its ocean bed. "By the breath of God frost is given: and the breadth of the waters is straitened" (Job 37:10). The iceberg straitened the Atlantic tract, and the great ship was sent to the bottom of the sea. That Mr. Harper should have been taken away in his prime has perplexed many. We have ventured frequently within the past few years to predict for him a great future of usefulness, but: "We know not what awaits us. God kindly veils our eyes." We reverently bow our heads under the shadow of this great calamity that has bereaved us of one who lived not for himself, but for the glory of Him who redeemed him with His own precious blood. It is hoped that this small memento of a life lived for God and for the good of his fellowman will carry a blessing with it, and be a stimulus to many. In this hope it is sent forth. -John Climie 197 St. Andrew's Rd, Glasgow</p></p><h2>Principia : Vol. 1 The Motion of Bodies</h2><p>Light wear to cover.

The backgrounds of the authors--in biology, sociology, teaching, and writing--have made possible a text that is multidisciplinary, authoritative, sex-positive, and a delight to read. Now in its third edition, <em>Discovering Human Sexuality</em> has established itself as a popular and widely praised text that respects diversity both in the sexual world and among the students who read it.<br><br>The third edition maintains the overall presentation of its predecessors, but adds coverage of recent sex-related developments in research, medicine, law, politics, and social trends. In addition, the authors have included two substantial appendices: one looks at sex and sexuality from an evolutionary perspective; the other provides additional material regarding the role of the nervous system in sexual functioning. The two appendices have been developed from sections of the authors' other text, <em>Human Sexuality</em>. The intent is to provide options for more advanced learning while leaving the main text accessible to students with more limited backgrounds in biology.<br><br>The third edition has many new boxes, illustrations, FAQs, and other features, as well as countless new references. What shines through is the richness of ideas about human sexuality that only an interdisciplinary collaboration can provide.</p><p><br><strong>Simon LeVay, Ph.D.</strong> is a British-born neuroscientist turned science writer and teacher. He was educated at Cambridge University and the University of Gï¿½ttingen, Germany. In 1971, he moved to the United States. He has served on the faculty of Harvard Medical School and the Salk Institute for Biological Studies, and has taught at Harvard, the University of California, and Stanford University. LeVay has authored over forty scientific studies; the best of known of these is a 1991 report in <em>Science</em> that described a difference in brain structure between heterosexual and homosexual men. This study helped spark a wealth of new research on the biology of sexual orientation. LeVay is the author or coauthor of ten books, some in the area of human sexuality and others on a broader range of scientific topics.<br><br><strong>Janice Baldwin, Ph.D.</strong> is a sociologist at the University of California, Santa Barbara. She is coauthor, with her husband John Baldwin, of numerous studies and articles in the area of sexuality and sex education, as well as the textbook <em>Behavior Principles in Everyday Life</em>, now in its fourth edition. The Baldwins co-teach an undergraduate Human Sexuality course that is regularly voted Best Course at UCSB. They also teach an advanced seminar course on the same topic. The Baldwins have been named as Best Professors on several occasions.<br>"Discovering Human Sexuality is unique in both approach and content. The authors have a point of view, but still provide balanced coverage of controversial issues. The boxes are wonderful. One of the things I like about it is the inclusion of historical and cross-cultural detail in the boxes.<br>It's a very readable and beautiful book. The illustrations and diagrams are excellent - the best of any text I have ever used."<br>-Josephine Caldwell-Ryan, Southern Methodist University</p><h2>Chill of the Ice Dragon: A Branches Book (Dragon Masters #9) (9)</h2><p>Pick a book.

Born in Tokyo in 1960, Urasawa debuted with BETA! in 1983 and hasn't stopped his impressive output since. Well-versed in a variety of genres, Urasawa's oeuvre encompasses a multitude of different subjects, such as a romantic comedy (Yawara! A Fashionable Judo Girl), a suspenseful human drama about a former mercenary (Pineapple ARMY; story by Kazuya Kudo), a captivating psychological suspense story (Monster), a sci-fi adventure manga (20th Century Boys), and a modern reinterpretation of the work of the God of Manga, Osamu Tezuka (Pluto: Urasawa x Tezuka; co-authored with Takashi Nagasaki, supervised by Macoto Tezka, and with the cooperation of Tezuka Productions). Many of his books have spawned popular animated and live-action TV programs and films, and 2008 saw the theatrical release of the first of three live-action Japanese films based on 20th Century Boys. No stranger to accolades and awards, Urasawa received the 2011 Eisner Award for Best U.S. Edition of International Material&#x2014;Asia, and is a three-time recipient of the prestigious Shogakukan Manga Award, a two-time recipient of the Osamu Tezuka Cultural Prize, and also received the Kodansha Manga Award. Urasawa has also become involved in the world of academia, and in 2008 accepted a guest teaching post at Nagoya Zokei University, where he teaches courses in, of course, manga.Gr 8 Up&#x2014;Soviet-era spy mystery meets medical drama in this manga about a young doctor struggling to navigate the world of professional politics and murder. Dr. Tenma is the third son in a family of doctors, who left Japan years ago to work under his idol in a hospital in Dusseldorf, Germany. His brilliance in surgery is matched only by his kindness to his patients, and his sense of obligation to everyone who comes through the door. He's on the fast track to promotion and power, until he refuses the hospital director's order to leave the victim of a brutal crime on the table and go help the mayor instead. Suddenly he goes from the cusp of a bright future to a grunt. His fiancï¿½e leaves him, his promotion is given away, and his patients are removed from his care. But when the men who took everything from Tenma wind up suddenly dead, he's set down a path that will change his life forever. This volume will please manga fans who crave history and humans over fantasy and fighting. The art is well done; characters are clearly defined from each other, with exaggerated features (noses, eyebrows, hair) that look perfectly in place in a 1980s flashback. Younger readers should be warned of violence (mostly off-screen), death, and murder.

The main character, A, wakes up every morning in a different body. Day to day, A can be male or female, any ethnicity, any size, and in any type of household. The only constant is that he (we'll go with that pronoun for convenience) is 16. A has been body jumping for as long as he can remember, and he has learned to not leave behind any trace of his presence--until he meets Rhiannon. For the first time in his life, A feels a true connection with another person. But can she love him back?

The novel <em>Every Day</em> starts on Day 5994 of A's life. For this story, I wanted to go back to a day in A's life before <em>Every Day</em>. Think of this as A recounting a few passing moments from his past.</p> <p> --David Levithan</p> <p> Download the short story [PDF]</p> <p><b>An Essay from the Author: A Similar Kind of Love Song</b></p> <p> Recently I was reading an interview in <em>OUT</em> magazine with Romy Madley Croft, the lead singer of the band the xx. Croft, talking about coming out, told the reporter, &#x201c;If I was singing about a guy, I would probably be singing a similar kind of love song, really.&#x201d; And I was struck that the same thing applied to my writing&#x2014;especially with my new book, <em>Every Day</em>. </p> <p> <em>Every Day</em> is about A, who wakes up each morning in a different body and a different life. It&#x2019;s not giving anything away to say that in the first chapter, A falls in love with a girl name Rhiannon . . . and that their relationship is rather complicated. </p> <p> So there I was&#x2014;a gay man, writing from the point of view of a character who is neither gay or straight, male or female. A has no inherent race, no inherent religion. A has grown up without friends, without family. A is purely a self. Whereas I, in my culturally and societally constructed life, am not. </p> <p> It should have been hard to write as A, but it wasn&#x2019;t. Because I found that, no matter which body A was in, I was singing a similar kind of love song. </p> <p> Ever since <em>Boy Meets Boy</em>, my first novel, was published, I&#x2019;ve received thousands of letters and emails from readers. Some of the most interesting ones have been from people who were surprised that they, non-gay or non-male, identified so deeply with the love story. <em>Love is love</em>, more than one reader wrote to me. And I thought, yes, that&#x2019;s it exactly. (I almost want to put it as a tip on my website, for all those students who write to me telling me their teacher has assigned them to identify the central theme in my work. Well, there it is. Love is love.) </p> <p> In <em>Every Day</em>, I wanted to look at that theme from a variety of angles. I wanted to test that theme, and find its limitations. Where A starts in <em>Every Day</em> is where many of my other characters&#x2014;my will grayson in <em>Will Grayson, Will Grayson</em>, for example&#x2014;reach at the end of my other novels. That is, they recognize that in order to love and be loved, they must be true to themselves. A is always true in this way. Writing A made me realize that this is one of the more helpful questions you can ask about love&#x2014;if I were truly myself, only myself, and not a gender, and not a sexual orientation, and not a race, and not any other external designation . . . what would I want? What would I do? </p> <p> A gets to live this ideal. But Rhiannon, who doesn&#x2019;t change bodies, is challenged to match it. This is the great conflict in the book, and informs one of the questions I posed to myself as I wrote it: Does love indeed conquer all? Or, in other words, does our world always allow love to be love? </p> <p> Again, I come back to that phrase &#x201c;a similar kind of love song.&#x201d; I like that she doesn&#x2019;t make them the same. I like that they&#x2019;re similar. There are certainly different challenges, at some times, in some places, with a gay love story. I often try to illuminate that experience in my writing. But there are also the same universal emotions. Joy is joy. Fear is fear. Vulnerability is vulnerability. Just like music is music, writing is writing, and love is love. </p>DAVID LEVITHAN is a children's book editor in New York City, and the author of several books for young adults, including <i>Nick &amp; Norah's Infinite Playlist </i>and <i>Dash &amp; Lily's Book of Dares</i> (co-authored with Rachel Cohn); <i>Will Grayson, Will Grayson</i> (co-authored with John Green); and <i>Every You, Every Me</i> (with photographs from Jonathan Farmer).

So the townspeople hatch a clever plan. They host a turkey-themed arts and crafts fair and lure a vain bird into town by advertising for an artist's model. Peter the Turkey, proud of his well-stuffed form, takes the bait but doesn't fall for the trap.</p><p>Shelly Bateman is an Amazon Publishing author.reS-Gr 2-In this rhyming story, Pete, a turkey outsmarts the townsfolk of old-time Squawk Valley as they mask their quest for a Thanksgiving entr&#x201a;e with the premise of needing a feathered model for a themed arts-and-crafts fair. Angular cartoon people, done in watercolor and gouache, create turkey sculptures of potatoes, rope, oatmeal, and soap, as well as collages and portraits. This variety of presentation makes it easy for Pete to hide temporarily among the exhibits when the moment of truth arrives. The faint typeface is somewhat difficult to read and some alliterative lines ("We'll fill our fair with folks and fun") will twist a tongue during read-alouds. The final page showing a dozen turkeys at the beach is a real champion, capturing various comical expressions and activities. An interactive Web site with games and activities offers entertaining follow-up.

Five storefronts away, an extremely tall man with muscles the size of cantaloupes was charging down the sidewalk, clutching a leopard-print purse. Behind him, an elderly woman lay sprawled on the ground.<br> <br>My first reaction was to think that it was a test.<br> <br>That might not seem like the correct reaction for a normal thirteen-year-old boy, but then, I wasn&#x2019;t a normal thirteen-year-old boy. I was a spy-in-training at the CIA&#x2019;s top secret Academy of Espionage, and it was standard practice at the school to spring fake emergencies on the students to see how we handled ourselves. This happened surprisingly often. Three days earlier, I had to defuse a phony bomb and survive an attack by ninjas before I even got to breakfast.<br> <br>These pop quizzes rarely took place off campus, though. And they usually concerned serious criminals like terrorists or assassins, rather than plain-old muggers. But I wasn&#x2019;t completely sure about this.<br> <br>&#x201c;Someone please help!&#x201d; the elderly woman cried.<br> <br>Even though the sidewalk was crowded with people, no one was trying to stop the thief. This was somewhat understandable, as the thief was built like a brick wall and looked as mean as a wounded bear. He was bowling over anyone who happened to be in his way; therefore, people were scrambling to clear a path for him. Trying to stop him would only be asking for trouble.<br> <br>He was now three storefronts away.<br> <br>I glanced at Erica Hale for guidance.<br> <br>Erica was two years ahead of me at spy school and by far the most accomplished student. In fact, she was probably more accomplished than most of the teachers. She was a legacy, a descendant of Nathan Hale, whose entire family tree was chock-full of secret agents, and she&#x2019;d been learning the ropes from her relatives since she was old enough to wield a billy club. In addition, she wasn&#x2019;t above springing a sudden sneak attack on me herself.<br> <br>The whole reason we were off campus together was that Erica was giving me extra tutoring in advanced survival techniques. I was only in my second year at the academy, but due to an unusual set of circumstances, I had managed to thwart the plans of SPYDER, our main enemy, four times so far. SPYDER was a covert organization dedicated to plotting chaos and mayhem for a price, and its operatives were getting rather annoyed at me for thwarting them. Now they wanted me dead.<br> <br>Unfortunately, the CIA wasn&#x2019;t great at adapting to unusual circumstances. School rules specifically stated that, as a second-year student, I wasn&#x2019;t allowed to take classes beyond Self-Preservation 202, even though I could really have used some more advanced training. So Erica had stepped in. She was tutoring me without permission, on her own time.<br> <br>Now, out on the street, watching the incoming criminal, she shook her head. It was a very small shake, almost imperceptible, but I understood both meanings of it:<br> <br>1) This wasn&#x2019;t a test. It was a real crime.<br> <br>2) I shouldn&#x2019;t get involved.<br> <br>The biggest problem with being a secret agent was the &#x201c;secret&#x201d; part. Once your cover was blown, there was no getting it back. My own parents didn&#x2019;t even know I was a student in spy school. In fact, the very existence of spy school itself was a secret. (There was quite obviously a campus, only a few blocks away, but it was hidden behind a great stone wall and claimed to be St. Smithen&#x2019;s Science Academy for Boys and Girls.)<br> <br>Erica was insanely talented at martial arts. She could have flattened the thief in less time than it took most people to tie their shoes. But then she&#x2019;d have to explain how a sixteen-year-old girl like her could do such a thing, which would open up a dozen cans of worms.<br> <br>Erica Hale wasn&#x2019;t going to do anything that would jeopardize her potential career as a spy. Even if that meant letting some jerk get away with stealing a poor old lady&#x2019;s purse. And she wanted me to know that I ought to do the same.<br> <br>There was only one problem with that:<br> <br>It didn&#x2019;t seem right.<br> <br>&#x201c;All my money is in that purse!&#x201d; the old lady wailed, a desperate last-ditch attempt to get some bystander to actually do something.<br> <br>The thief was almost on top of me. Close enough to look me in the eye. It was a look that said he was considering shoving me into the street merely for being within arm&#x2019;s reach.<br> <br>I couldn&#x2019;t beat this guy in a fight. I had the martial arts skills of a box turtle. (That was a direct quote from Professor Simon after my latest self-preservation exam.) But I did have other talents that could come in handy.<br> <br>For starters, I was extremely good at math. I could do advanced calculations in my head, I never forgot a phone number, and I could instantly work out complicated concepts like trajectories or gravitational forces with relative accuracy.<br> <br>In addition, I was learning to be hyperaware of my surroundings. This was one of the things Erica had been teaching me. It was much easier to escape an attack by evil assailants when you knew they were coming, as opposed to being caught by surprise. As it was, I had clocked everyone on the sidewalk ahead of me, and thus had registered:<br> <br>1) The heavyset man walking toward me with a bulldog on a six-foot leash.<br> <br>2) The waiter wheeling a loaded dessert cart out of the sidewalk cafï¿½ just ahead and to my right.<br> <br>3) The three young women dining at an outdoor table at the same cafï¿½. The one closest to me had a triple-decker club sandwich.<br> <br>Erica, who was even more aware of things than I was&#x2014;hyper-hyperaware&#x2014;registered that I had registered all of this and shook her head again, more firmly this time, meaning that she really didn&#x2019;t want me to get involved.<br> <br>I did anyway.<br> <br>As the thief bore down on me, I made a show of leaping out of the way, banging into the table with the three young women hard enough to upset their water glasses into their laps. While they were distracted by this, I deftly snatched two strips of bacon from the club sandwich and tossed them to the ground at my feet.<br> <br>The bulldog, being a dog, lunged for the bacon, snapping its leash taut right in front of the thief. If I had done this with a smaller dog, such as a toy poodle or a bichon frise, my plan wouldn&#x2019;t have worked, but the bulldog was the size and weight of a sack of concrete. When the thief ran into the leash, the bulldog held fast like an anchor. The leash caught the thief at shin height, tripping him and sending him flying.<br> <br>At this point, I gave the dessert cart a small &#x201c;accidental&#x201d; nudge, just enough to knock it from the waiter&#x2019;s grasp&#x2014;and place it directly in the thief&#x2019;s path.<br> <br>The thief landed on it so hard that a Boston cream pie exploded on impact, coating a few nearby diners with custard. The thief himself ended up face-first in a double-chocolate torte, which caught him by such surprise that he dropped the purse. However, the force with which he landed made the dessert cart roll faster than I&#x2019;d expected. (In the few seconds I&#x2019;d had to concoct a plan, I hadn&#x2019;t been able to calculate everything.) The cart now raced down the sidewalk, which sloped gently downhill, increasing the cart&#x2019;s speed even more. Startled pedestrians scrambled out of the way as it careened past them. The thief, though blinded by chocolate, was still aware that something bad was happening, and he screamed as he hurtled along. The cart gained more and more speed&#x2014;until it slammed into a fire hydrant at the corner and stopped abruptly. Meanwhile, the thief didn&#x2019;t stop. He was large enough to have considerable inertia, and his body was now greased with various mousses and gelatins, so he shot right off the cart and flew through the air.<br> <br>It was only now that I noticed something about my surroundings I had failed to register before:<br> <br>The street beyond the corner was under construction.<br> <br>Several utility workers in bright orange vests were overseeing a project that required three major pieces of construction equipment. A trench had been gouged into the road to allow access to a large sewer pipe, which had been cut open as well. The thief tumbled right through the gap and plunged headfirst into the sewage. He landed with a sickening squelch, which was followed by his cry of abject disgust.<br> <br>Every person around had recorded the entire incident on their phones.<br> <br>However, no one had noticed my involvement. I had been cautious enough to make it look like a freak accident.<br> <br>Erica grabbed my arm and dragged me away before anyone even realized we were there.<br> <br>The waiter picked up the purse and returned it to the old lady, who had struggled back to her feet.<br> <br>Everyone else began to either forward the videos they had recorded to friends or upload them to the Internet. It didn&#x2019;t seem to have occurred to anyone that they could use their phones to call the police.<br> <br>Thankfully, the old lady didn&#x2019;t appear to be hurt. In fact, she was laughing so hard at the fate of the thief that her false teeth had come loose.<br> <br>I tried to head toward her, just to make sure she was all right, but Erica kept her iron grip locked on my arm and hustled me across the street. &#x201c;That was an unnecessary risk,&#x201d; she said angrily under her breath.<br> <br>&#x201c;The man was a criminal,&#x201d; I argued. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re supposed to stop criminals.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Major criminals,&#x201d; Erica corrected. &#x201c;International arms dealers. Terrorists. Lunatics determined to cause chaos and mayhem. Not common thieves. That&#x2019;s a job for the police.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t see any police around. And besides, I was subtle about the way I did it.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Subtle? You call sending a man cannonballing down the street on a dessert cart subtle? Why didn&#x2019;t you just trip him?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I was trying to look like I wasn&#x2019;t involved! You can&#x2019;t trip someone without them noticing.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Of course you can.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No you can&#x2019;t&#x2014;&#x201d; I began, though I didn&#x2019;t get to finish the thought, because Erica tripped me. At least, I thought she did. It happened so fast, I didn&#x2019;t actually notice her doing it. One moment I was arguing with her; the next I was sprawled in a flower bed.<br> <br>&#x201c;See?&#x201d; Erica asked.<br> <br>&#x201c;Point well made.&#x201d; I got back to my feet, brushing mulch off my shirt. &#x201c;Okay, maybe it wasn&#x2019;t subtle. But it was effective.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Sending the man flying into the open sewer was a bit much.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Er,&#x201d; I said uncomfortably. &#x201c;Well . . .&#x201d;<br> <br>Erica sighed. &#x201c;Let me guess. You didn&#x2019;t notice the open sewer until it was too late.&#x201d;<br> <br>There didn&#x2019;t seem to be any point in denying it. &#x201c;Yes.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You didn&#x2019;t notice a giant, gaping hole in the street with a dozen men in bright orange vests surrounding it?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;It was almost a block away. And there were other things going on. Like a robbery in progress.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;There are always going to be other things going on, Ben. But you need to be on the alert at all times. People are trying to kill you.&#x201d;<br> <br>I probably should have been upset by Erica&#x2019;s exasperation with me. But I wasn&#x2019;t. Despite the fact that my life was in constant danger and Erica was berating me for my lack of skills, I couldn&#x2019;t help but feel pleased.<br> <br>Because Erica Hale was worried for my safety. Which meant she cared about me.<br> <br>In addition to being the most competent spy at school, Erica was also the most beautiful girl I had ever met. She had hypnotic eyes, lustrous hair, and the intoxicating scent of lilacs and gunpowder. Plus, she could beat a man twice her size senseless.<br> <br>However, Erica generally didn&#x2019;t like other people. Until recently, she had considered having any friends at all a liability. This had earned her the nickname &#x201c;Ice Queen&#x201d; at school. But over the past year, I had earned her respect&#x2014;and, even more importantly, her affection. Or the closest to affection that Erica could allow herself. She wasn&#x2019;t willing to go on a date, or even consider the idea of being my girlfriend, but she had once kissed me when we thought we were going to be vaporized by a nuclear bomb. And now she was teaching me to survive, rather than leaving me to the wolves.<br> <br>However, she still had some work to do where basic social skills were concerned.<br> <br>&#x201c;Why are you smiling?&#x201d; she asked me.<br> <br>&#x201c;Am I smiling?&#x201d; I asked, then realized that I was, given how thrilled I was that Erica cared about my safety. &#x201c;Sorry, I&#x2019;ll stop.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Good. This is serious stuff.&#x201d; Erica still hadn&#x2019;t released her vise grip on my arm. She hooked me around a corner, aiming me back toward campus. &#x201c;You already have enough problems with SPYDER being after you. If you pull another stunt like that and get outed as a spy, the CIA will cut you loose, and then no one will be able to protect you anymore.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You will,&#x201d; I said.<br> <br>&#x201c;No I won&#x2019;t. It&#x2019;ll be against the rules.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ll still do it. Because any attempt SPYDER makes on me will be a lead to SPYDER.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re smiling again,&#x201d; Erica said.<br> <br>Which was true. However, Erica was also dodging the subject.<br> <br>Even though we had thwarted SPYDER four times, we still didn&#x2019;t know much about them&#x2014;and neither did anyone else at the CIA. In fact, until a year before, no one at the CIA had known that SPYDER even existed. We didn&#x2019;t know who ran the organization or where they were holed up. We didn&#x2019;t know how many moles they had in the government or who they might be. And we didn&#x2019;t have the slightest idea what they were plotting next. The few slim leads we&#x2019;d found had come up dry.<br> <br>Until that very moment.<br> <br>Erica&#x2019;s phone buzzed in her pocket.<br> <br>This struck me as odd, because only three people on earth knew Erica&#x2019;s phone number: her grandfather, who was a very good spy for the CIA; her mother, who was a very good spy for MI6 (so good that even Erica&#x2019;s grandfather didn&#x2019;t know about her); and me. Even then, Erica had only given me her number grudgingly, insisting that it was exclusively for life-and-death emergencies. Her own father, who was also a spy, didn&#x2019;t even have it. This was because Alexander Hale was a lousy spy&#x2014;although he had been clever enough to hide this from most of the CIA until recently.<br> <br>Erica seemed moderately concerned that anyone was calling her. She pulled out the phone, checked the caller ID, then answered curtly. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s the situation?&#x201d;<br> <br>She listened for a few seconds, then said, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m with him now. I&#x2019;ll bring him right in.&#x201d; Then she hung up and said, &#x201c;Granddad wants to see you. Immediately.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Why?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Murray Hill says he&#x2019;s finally ready to talk.&#x201d;<br> <br>That caught me by surprise. Murray Hill was only a year older than me, but he was one of SPYDER&#x2019;s most devious operatives. He had been a mole at spy school for months and nearly succeeded in blowing the place up. Since then, he&#x2019;d been caught and had escaped several times. For the past month, he&#x2019;d been incarcerated at spy school, during which he had steadfastly refused to say anything he knew about SPYDER, no matter how much he was offered in return.<br> <br>&#x201c;Why&#x2019;s he ready to talk now?&#x201d; I asked.<br> <br>&#x201c;Granddad didn&#x2019;t know. He said Murray just decided to do it.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;And what&#x2019;s this got to do with me?&#x201d;<br> <br>Erica rolled her eyes, the way she always did when I wasn&#x2019;t ...</p><h2>The Jeremiah Study Bible, NKJV: Jacketed Hardcover: What It Says.

From sourcing and butchering to dry ageing and curing, it challenges everything we thought we knew about the subject and invites readers to see fish for what it really is &#x2013; an amazing, complex source of protein that can, and should, be treated with exactly the same nose-to-tail reverence as meat.<br><br>Featuring more than 60 recipes for dozens of fish species ranging from Cod Liver Pate on Toast, Fish Cassoulet and Roast Fish Bone Marrow to &#x2013; essentially &#x2013; the Perfect Fish and Chips, <em>The Whole Fish Cookbook</em>&nbsp;will soon have readers seeing that there is so much more to a fish than just the fillet and that there are more than just a handful of fish in the sea.</p><p>Josh Niland is the chef/owner of Saint Peter, a fish restaurant that opened in Sydney to widespread critical acclaim in 2016. In doing so, Niland started a conversation around boundary-pushing seafood, as well as winning every significant award in Australia for his world-leading approach to using the whole fish and wasting nothing. In 2018, Josh opened The Fish Butchery &#x2013; Australia's first sustainable fishmonger &#x2013; which sells dry-aged, cured and smoked fish and offal to an eager public as well as supplying a number of Sydney's best restaurants. In 2019, his work was also recognized by the inaugural World Restaurant Awards, where he was shortlisted in the ethical thinking category.&nbsp;<em>The Whole Fish Cookbook</em> is his first book.'Here's one of those rare books that teaches you the basics. An inspiring read, and something to return to again and again - these pages are sure to be worn down quick.' -Rene Redzepi, chef and author<br><br>'I have followed Josh for such a long time and adore him and his use of every part of a fish - what a trailblazer he is . this book is for home cooks as much as chefs and I applaud it.' -Maggie Beer, author<br><br>'I have been racking my brain trying to think of an American restaurant that comes close to the inventiveness and deep consideration that seafood is afforded at Saint Peter, to no avail ... Saint Peter is proof that when it comes to the modern dedicated seafood restaurant, Australia does it best.' -Besha Rodell, The New York Times<br><br>'Well that was a smack around the head! This book is a game changer! Josh has basically taken all the old ways of fish prep and cookery and thrown the bad ones out the window then turned what remains on its head. This book is such an eye opener for me personally and at the same time makes so much sense when Josh explains how he thinks about the world of seafood. This is a very, very special book and in many years to come, I will look back at this moment in time and say to myself, "Remember that time when Josh from Saint Peter brought that book out and we all had to rethink the way we prepared and cooked fish and seafood forever?" Thanks Josh and to all the team at Saint Peter for sharing this knowledge with us!' -Nathan Outlaw, chef and author<br><br>'To desire simplicity is a very complex exercise. Josh Niland is an inspiration to our profession. In The Whole Fish Cookbook he offers us a wealth of enjoyment and enthusiasm. In a compelling way, he shows us that with time and patience you can discover the real depth of flavour.' -Bo Bech, chef and author<br><br>'There's no other chef in the world that I would rather have scale me with his knife, dry-age me, roast me, glaze me, rest me, slice me, serve me than this powerful spirit! Thank you Josh for paying attention and caring the way you do! You are a shining light!' -Matty Matheson, chef and author<br><br>'Josh Niland is a genius.' -Nigella Lawson, author<br><br>'Josh Niland can coax deliciousness from fish eyeballs, swim bladders and even fish blood with confidence and elegance ... his endeavours, sometimes hauntingly visceral, other times plainly cheeky, [are] always beautiful and restrained. His approach is going to change the way the world thinks about cooking and eating seafood.' -Melanie Hansche, Food &amp; Wine<br><br>'If you love cooking fish, this book will be a revelation. You'll learn about dry-ageing to concentrate flavour and using every part but the bubble from the fish's mouth!' -Rick Stein, chef and author<br><br>'Equal parts comprehensive technical manual and a giant porthole into creativity, chef Niland's honest and pure approach to all things fish is inspiring. The Whole Fish Cookbook beautifully articulates the entire animal approach while methodically opening the reader's mind to how responsibility and innovation coexist.' -Grant Achatz, chef and author.</p><h2>Oh, The Things You Can Do That Are Good for You: All About Staying Healthy (Cat in the Hat&#39;s Learning Library)</h2><p><b>The Cat in the Hat joins forces with the Partnership for a Healthier America!</b><br><br>In this newly revised editiion&#x2014;with 16 pages of bonus materials&#x2014;the Cat in the Hat takes young readers to a Seussian Spa where they learn the basics of healthy living.

Strangely enough, his moment of enlightenment came behind the bars of San Quentin's death row. In this compelling memoir, inmate and author Jarvis Jay Masters takes us from the arms of his heroin-addicted mother to an abusive foster home, on his escape to the illusory freedom of the streets and through lonely nights spent in bus stations and juvenile homes, and finally to life inside the walls of San Quentin State Prison. Using the nub and filler from a ballpoint pen (the only writing instrument allowed him in solitary confinement), Masters chronicles the story of a bright boy who turns to a life of crime, and of a penitent man who embraces Buddhism to find hope in this ultimately inspirational story. </p><p>Masters has written his remarkable story as a cautionary tale for anyone who might be tempted to follow in his footsteps, and as a plea for under-standing to a world that too often ignores the plight of the forgotten members of society. His personal story dramatically reminds us all that freedom and opportunity are not to be taken for granted, and that no matter what their neighborhood, no matter what their race, <em>every</em> child matters.</p><p>An inmate at San Quentin since the age of nineteen, Jarvis Jay Masters is the author of <em>Finding Freedom</em> as well as many articles. In 1992, Masters won a PEN Award for his poem "Recipe for Prison Pruno." </p><p>In 1990, Masters was moved to death row after being convicted of conspiracy in the murder of a prison guard. In April 2008, the California Supreme Court ordered an evidentiary hearing based on the lack of substantial evidence for Masters's conviction.Many people believe in Masters's innocence and are actively working within the legal system to free him.</p></p><h2>New York School of Interior Design: Home: The Foundations of Enduring Spaces</h2><p><p><b>"An essential text for all students of design . . .

But you'd never know it by looking at her. To keep the family safe, Min's mother insists that none of them use any fox-magic, such as Charm or shape-shifting. They must appear human at all times. Min feels hemmed in by the household rules and resents the endless chores, the cousins who crowd her, and the aunties who judge her. She would like nothing more than to escape Jinju, her neglected, dust-ridden, and impoverished planet. She's counting the days until she can follow her older brother, Jun, into the Space Forces and see more of the Thousand Worlds. When word arrives that Jun is suspected of leaving his post to go in search of the Dragon Pearl, Min knows that something is wrong. Jun would never desert his battle cruiser, even for a mystical object rumored to have tremendous power. She decides to run away to find him and clear his name. Min's quest will have her meeting gamblers, pirates, and vengeful ghosts. It will involve deception, lies, and sabotage.

Instead, Washington rallied&#x2014;thanks in large part to a little-known, top-secret group called the Culper Spy Ring. He realized that he couldn&#x2019;t defeat the British with military might, so he recruited a sophisticated and deeply secretive intelligence network to infiltrate New York.<br><br>Drawing on extensive research, Brian Kilmeade and Don Yaeger have offered fascinating portraits of these spies: a reserved Quaker merchant, a tavern keeper, a brash young longshoreman, a curmudgeonly Long Island bachelor, a coffeehouse owner, and a mysterious woman. Long unrecognized, the secret six are finally receiving their due among the pantheon of American heroes.</p><p><b>Brian Kilmeade </b>cohosts Fox News Channel&#x2019;s morning show <i>Fox &amp; Friends</i> and hosts the nationally syndicated radio show <i>The Brian Kilmeade Show</i>.

First, the British had taken New York City and Long Island&#x2014;the cornerstones of Washington&#x2019;s strategy because of their valuable geographic and economic positions at the heart of the North American colonies. Now, Washington&#x2019;s attempt at building an intelligence network to recoup that loss had failed spectacularly. Just two months after the fledgling country&#x2019;s declaration of independence, there seemed to be no future for the new nation.</p><p>And yet there had been so much hope just a season ago, in spring. After successfully sending the British packing from Boston in March after a prolonged siege, Washington had begun ordering troops toward New York City, whose harbor was of tremendous tactical&#x2014;and psychological&#x2014;importance. If the Patriots could hold that other great port of the Northeast, victory might be within reach.</p><p>As Washington left Massachusetts on April 4, 1776, to begin his own march southward to rejoin his men, the cheerful reports sent back by the advance parties were confirmed: Farmers and tradesmen were greeting the American troops as they passed through rural villages, pressing gifts of food and drink on the soldiers who had displayed such courage and pluck fighting the redcoats.</p><p>&#x201c;Enjoy this bacon,&#x201d; urged local butchers, heaving slabs of salted meat onto the supply wagons.</p><p>&#x201c;Fresh milk!&#x201d; announced the housewives who scrambled out of their cottages wielding buckets and dippers.</p><p>Gaggles of little boys wearing homespun blue jackets gathered to parade in front of the men as they traversed through town&#x2014;one child held up a twig as if playing a fife; another pretended to beat a drum in a marching rhythm; the rest chanted the popular refrain &#x201c;Join or die!&#x201d; as they reveled in the Patriotic fervor and holiday atmosphere.</p><p>Even the sophisticated city crowd, usually much more reserved in their displays of celebration than the country folk, had cheered in the streets as Washington crossed into Providence, Rhode Island. In roadside taverns and stylish urban coffeehouses across Connecticut, toasts were raised to the unlikely homegrown heroes and their quiet but imposing leader. As word spread up the Hudson Valley that the Continental Army was on the move, settlers who now considered themselves Americans, rather than Dutch or German or British subjects, had whispered prayers for the protection and advancement of the cause of independence.</p><p>Throughout his nine-day journey spanning four states and nearly three hundred miles of forest roads soggy with springtime mud, Washington had seen increasing hope among the people. There were dissenting voices&#x2014;those whose closed shutters and drawn shades as the Continental Army passed bespoke their loyalty to King George III and the motherland. But it was clear that there was a sense of growing excitement that this wild, untested experiment in personal freedom and individual rights just might prove more powerful than the most disciplined and well-equipped fighting force on earth.</p><p>Despite the buoyant spirits of the people, Washington&#x2019;s own hope was kept in check by a sober view of facts. While the Patriots had enjoyed some early victories in Massachusetts, these wins came at a high cost when compared with their tactical significance. The Battle of Bunker Hill in June 1775, however, had gone to the British, though with heavy loss of life and limb on both sides. The Siege of Boston, which ended the following March, had been a win for the Patriots, but their success was due more to the position and strength of the American fortifications than any great offensive maneuvers to rout the enemy. In the end, the British gave up on the city, leaving voluntarily rather than fleeing in an all-out retreat. General William Howe, commander in chief of the British army in North America, had his sights set on a much bigger and more agreeable prize than belligerent Boston.</p><p>New York, tenuously held by a few American troops, was desired by both sides. In the north, the Americans had secured Boston for the moment. To the south, the action had not yet reached a critical point, though its time was coming. Right now, the most pressing concern was in the middle states, where Philadelphia and New York lay vulnerable. Philadelphia was the largest city in the colonies at the time and held great symbolic status as a seat of innovation, boasting one of the first hospitals and public libraries, as well as hosting the meetings of the Continental Congress. Capturing the seat of the fledgling nation&#x2019;s government would be a great victory for the British. And New York City was the linchpin&#x2014;if the British won it they could bring the colonies to their knees.</p><p>As the second-most-populous city in the colonies, New York was their northern economic hub. But even more significant was New York&#x2019;s location and situation&#x2014;right in the center of Britain&#x2019;s North American settlements and home to both a large deep-water harbor and access to the Hudson River. The army that held New York City and its waterways had a strategic advantage not only in controlling the import and export of foodstuffs and dry goods (which, in turn, affected the economic stability of the region) but also in securing a key foothold for transporting troops up and down the coast.</p><p>Maintaining control of New York would give the American fighting corps and the colonial populace a tremendous boost in confidence. Failing to capture and hold New York City and New York Harbor would certainly be an embarrassment to the British army and navy, but they would survive the blow. For the Americans, however, losing the region would be a tragedy, destroying morale, cutting off trade, and drastically lowering the odds that the Patriots would win the war.</p><p>New York&#x2019;s strategic significance, from a trade perspective, was not lost on General Howe. The loss in Massachusetts was a disappointment, but Boston was not the ultimate prize for the British. Howe wanted to choke off the Revolution by isolating the northern colonies from the southern ones. If the political radicals in the somewhat geographically clustered northern cities were segregated from their counterparts in the more spread-out south, they could not cross-pollinate ideologies, and the various factions might be more easily eliminated. It was a classic case of divide and conquer, with New York City as the essential element in creating the chasm.</p><p>After regrouping in Halifax, Nova Scotia, following their defeat in Boston, the British set out for New York. On June 29, 1776, three British ships sailed into lower New York Harbor, with General Howe aboard one of them. Both sides knew a battle was imminent.</p><p>As Washington marched south in anticipation of Howe&#x2019;s attack, he must have nursed the hope that the Continental Army&#x2019;s muscle and moxie were enough to outfight the British and hold Manhattan. Being a seasoned fighter and a brilliant strategist, he would have understood, perhaps better than anyone else in North America at the time, that control of New York City was essential for the cause of liberty&#x2014;and that keeping the city would be a daunting task.</p><p>Washington and his men arrived in New York in mid-April 1776 and settled in Manhattan. That summer news arrived that both cheered and sobered them. Fifty-six delegates had convened in the midst of stifling July heat in Philadelphia to form the Second Continental Congress, and had forged the Declaration of Independence. If ever there was a point of no return, this was it.</p><p>Knowing the attack on New York would not be long delayed, Washington made a short trip to New Jersey and Pennsylvania to meet with his generals. They discussed New York&#x2019;s defenses and supplies&#x2014;all while trying to anticipate the exact mode of attack. The British, meanwhile, began amassing troops on undefended Staten Island in advance of storming the American positions just across the water in Brooklyn and Manhattan.</p><p>As August dragged on, tensions mounted. A copy of the July fourth declaration had been put before the Crown, which meant that King George finally understood the seriousness of the colonists&#x2019; determination to fight. No longer would King George order his generals to show restraint in their efforts to squelch the rebels or maintain that a mere show of force would be enough to subdue the Revolution. He would not hold back. He would not show mercy. Of this Washington felt sure, and the weight of the &#x201c;lives, fortunes, and sacred honor&#x201d; pledged in the name of freedom rested heavily upon his shoulders.</p><p>Across the river from Washington, General Henry Clinton had arrived to help lead the attack upon the American positions in New York. As August waned, the British ships loomed large in the harbor, the growing number of redcoats on Staten Island intimidating the sparse American troops.</p><p>Faced with an impending attack, Washington sighed one August day as he surveyed the undisciplined, ragtag army at his command in lower Manhattan; his aide-de-camp shifted nervously behind him. The general cleared his throat. &#x201c;General Howe is rumored to have more than thirty thousand men in the Royal Navy assembled offshore, and twenty thousand men amassed on Staten Island. And we have . . . ?&#x201d;</p><p>His aide was reluctant to reply: &#x201c;Ten thousand.&#x201d;</p><p>If the number was a blow to Washington, he did not show it. Ever the stoic, he refused to allow this dismal news to throw him into despair. Washington was famed as a man who never lost his nerve in battle. The sound of musket fire, the crash of cannonballs, the smell of smoke&#x2014;none of that seemed to shake his calm, measured way of surveying the chaos and keeping his wits about him as he led his men forward.</p><p>But despite Washington&#x2019;s steely nerve, the Americans were in grave trouble. Even substantial numbers of troops meant little without proper training and equipment, and Washington&#x2019;s men lacked both. Washington had the utmost confidence in his officers, but to say that the rank and file of the Continental Army was rough around the edges was an understatement. City men who had never before wielded a rifle stood with country folk who had never had a day of formal schooling. Hardy homesteaders struggled to cooperate with young men of landed wealth who had never known a moment of discomfort or hunger in their lives. Old men lined up with boys who had lied about their age to join the rebels in pursuit of adventure. They came from all over the country: from as far north as the mountains of New Hampshire and as far south as the swamps of Georgia. Many of Washington&#x2019;s men had never before been more than fifty miles from the place of their birth, let alone met anyone with such a strange accent as could be found in the hills of Virginia or the Puritan settlements of Massachusetts. They were all on the side of liberty, but there the unity ended.</p><p>Most were brave, to be sure, and loyal&#x2014;perhaps to a fault. And they were all passionate about their liberty. Washington knew he had the hearts of his men, but whether the passion of an undisciplined few could hold New York against the meticulously trained British forces was another question.</p><p>&#x201c;Hang together or we all hang separately,&#x201d; Washington mused, reciting one of the familiar mantras of the Patriot cause, as he caught a few strains of a bawdy pub song led by the Marylanders sitting around a campfire. All possible preparations against the British onslaught had been made, and he and his men would have to trust it would be enough.</p><p>Knowing that an attack was imminent, Washington had made the strategic decision to divide his men into five groups. One had already crossed the harbor to Long Island, and another was stationed in northern Manhattan to fend off a British encroachment from that direction. The other three groups were situated to defend the lower end of Manhattan. There were several land routes the British might take, but Washington felt confident that all but the least likely and somewhat untraveled route, through Jamaica Pass, were secure. And now . . . they waited.</p><p>BETRAYAL AT JAMAICA PASS</p><p>The battle was swift and devastating.</p><p>Tipped off by someone&#x2014;whether a spy within Washington&#x2019;s own ranks or a disgruntled Loyalist in New York was unclear&#x2014;the British learned that Jamaica Pass was guarded by only five men and set out in that direction.</p><p>William Howard Jr., a young Patriot who ran a tavern with his father near Jamaica Pass, Long Island, woke about two hours after midnight on the morning of August 27 to a British soldier standing beside his bed. The soldier ordered him to get up, dress, and go downstairs. He quickly obeyed and found his father cornered by three redcoats pointing their muskets with fixed bayonets at him. A glance out the window revealed that a whole fighting unit stood at the ready upon the grounds.</p><p>General Howe waited for the two men in the barroom. Sipping a glass of commandeered liquor, he attempted, rather absurdly, to make small talk with the terrified father and son before finally getting to the point. &#x201c;I must have some one of you to show me over the Rockaway Path around the pass,&#x201d; he remarked, setting down his empty glass.</p><p>&#x201c;We belong to the other side, General,&#x201d; the father replied, &#x201c;and can&#x2019;t serve you against our duty.&#x201d;</p><p>Howe&#x2019;s reply was kind but curt. &#x201c;That is all very well; stick to your country or stick to your principles when you are free to do so. But tonight, Howard, you are my prisoner, and must guide my men over the hill.&#x201d;</p><p>The senior Howard began to protest, but Howe cut him off: &#x201c;You have no alternative. If you refuse you will be shot.&#x201d;</p><p>Shaking, and unaware of just how damaging their compliance would prove, the Howards directed General Howe safely up the winding footpath. Behind them marched ten thousand men through the vulnerable pass, arriving at the other side in time to effectively flank the Patriot general Nathan Woodhull and his men, who were occupied with the frontal assault waged against their defenses in Manhattan when daylight came. As the battle continued throughout the day, Washington recognized his miscalculation that the full contingent of British troops would storm Manhattan&#x2014;the redcoats were also bringing heavy force to bear on Brooklyn. Washington shifted more men and matï¿½riel to Brooklyn, but it was too late for the Americans to recover and hold their ground. By day&#x2019;s end, Brooklyn and the surrounding area was largely in British hands, with the retreating Patriots trapped in Brooklyn Heights. Manhattan alone still held, but Washington was sure it was only a matter of time until the British overtook it, too.</p><p>Washington&#x2019;s troops were decimated. All told, the Americans had lost more than 300 men that day, in addition to nearly 700 wounded and 1,000 captured. The British (and their German mercenaries, the Hessians) had lost a mere 64 men, with 31 reported as missing, and 293 wounded.</p><p>A MIRACLE IN THE MIST</p><p>Things could not have gone more badly for the Continental Army, and both sides knew it. And it wasn&#x2019;t over, though the cannons had ceased to fire. The fighting had taken Washington across the East River, but now...</p></p><h2>The Time Keeper</h2><p><strong>From the author who's inspired millions worldwide with books like <i>Tuesdays with Morrie</i> and <i>The Five People You Meet in Heaven</i> comes his most imaginative novel yet, <i>The Time Keeper</i>--a compelling fable about the first man on Earth to count the hours.<br><br>The man who became Father Time.<br></strong><br>In Mitch Albom's exceptional work of fiction, the inventor of the world's first clock is punished for trying to measure God's greatest gift.

The battle line against biblical manhood is clearly drawn and fiercely contested. More than ever, men who want to follow Christ are asking:<br> &nbsp;<br> <i>ï¿½ Why is it so hard to live an authentic Christian life?</i><br> <i>ï¿½ Who will show me how to thrive as a father, a husband, and on the job?</i><br> <i>ï¿½ What should I do when I&#x2019;m being tested to the breaking point?</i><br> &nbsp;<br> Fortunately, the Bible preserves crucial details about the powerful lessons learned by men who have already faced and answered these questions. In&nbsp;<i>How God Makes Men,</i> renowned expert on men&#x2019;s issues Patrick Morley takes you into Scripture for a first-hand encounter with:<br> &nbsp;<br> ï¿½ Ten epic stories of the Bible&#x2019;s most talked-about men<br> ï¿½ Ten proven principles&#x2014;based on their failures and successes&#x2014;that show how God works in a man&#x2019;s life, and how you can cooperate with Him in yours<br> ï¿½ The huge promise that you&nbsp;<i>can</i>&nbsp;become the man God created you to be<br> &nbsp;<br> Don&#x2019;t settle for less. Join Patrick on this epic adventure of becoming God&#x2019;s man. You&#x2019;ll discover how to prevail in tough times and release God&#x2019;s power in every area of your life.</p><p><p><b></b></p><p><b>Q&amp;A with Patrick Morley, author of <i>How God Makes Men</i> </b></p><p></p> <p><strong>Q) Pat, you&#x2019;ve been involved in men&#x2019;s ministry for over 30 years. What do you see going on with men today that made you want to write this book?</strong></p> <p>A) I love my work, and we are seeing amazing results. Every day we see men coming to Christ and growing as disciples. That said, we need to do a reality check. We live in a counter-Christian pop culture that ridicules men in general and Christian men in particular. The battle line against biblical manhood is clearly drawn and fiercely contested. As a result, legions of men struggle to sustain what they started and finish the race. It&#x2019;s as though they&#x2019;ve enlisted and been issued a weapon that they&#x2019;ve never learned how to clean and shoot. They&#x2019;re sitting ducks on the day of battle. That&#x2019;s what made me want to write <i>How God Makes Men</i>.</p> <p><strong>Q) Why are there so few role models in our culture? Where can men look to find examples of godly fathers, husbands, and working professionals?</strong></p> <p>A) There are TONS of men out there who are getting it right. They&#x2019;re just not famous. They are quietly working out their faith by seeking God&#x2019;s plan in the company of a few like-minded men. God&#x2019;s plan is made up of strikingly relevant, time-tested lessons written down and preserved for us in the Bible. It pulsates with stories about men who released and sustained the passion of their faith. They became the men God created them to be. However, it&#x2019;s shocking how many of these life-changing principles are gathering dust. It&#x2019;s as though we&#x2019;re afraid to tell men, &#x201c;Following Christ is harder than it looks and takes longer than expected. But God <i>does</i> have a plan, and it comes packed with real answers and genuine hope.&#x201d;</p> <p><strong>Q) In <i>How God Makes Men</i>, you pick 10 men from the Bible who can serve as mentors to men today. How did you decide which 10 to include?</strong></p> <p>A)I was interested in showing men just how relevant the lessons learned by men in the Bible are to them today. So I picked 10 men who are particularly relevant for today and developed 10 highly desirable principles about biblical manhood from their lives. How did God mold and mobilize these men? What were the obstacles they faced? What held them back? How did God get them uncoiled? And what was their part? In each of their epic stories, we can see the hand of God at work&#x2014;shaping them, leading them, making them into the men He always planned for them to become.</p> <p><strong>Q) Which biblical hero is your favorite, and what do we learn from him about living a powerful life?</strong></p> <p>A) Wow! That&#x2019;s like asking me which of my children I love the most! How about, I love them all equally but for different reasons. From Abraham, we learn about <i>faith</i>&#x2014;that God makes men by showing us how we can believe Him anyway in the face of what seems like impossible circumstances. Joseph teaches us about <i>perseverance</i>&#x2014;that God makes men by orchestrating even the toughest circumstances of our lives for a greater good.</p> <p>Moses teaches us about <i>transformation</i>&#x2014;how God makes men by taking us through a humbling process that fundamentally changes the way we think. From Gideon we learn about real <i>strength</i>&#x2014;and see that God makes men by turning our weakness into strength in such a striking way that only He can get the glory.</p> <p>The sobering story of David reminds us about <i>discipline</i>&#x2014;how God makes men by doing whatever it takes to correct and restore us when we go astray. We can turn to Solomon to learn about true <i>happiness</i>&#x2014;that God makes men by making it impossible for us to find lasting happiness in any pursuit apart from Him.</p> <p>From Nehemiah, we learn about how God <i>calls</i> men to action&#x2014;that God makes men by turning what breaks our hearts into a passionate calling to help redeem some broken part of His world. In the story of Job, we gain insight into <i>suffering</i>&#x2014;that God makes men by allowing us to gain through suffering what we can gain no other way.</p> <p>When we come to Peter, we learn the compelling principle of <i>discipleship</i>&#x2014;how God makes men by a process of calling, equipping, and sending us so we can call, equip, and send others. Finally, through the passionate story of Paul, we learn about <i>surrender</i>&#x2014;that God makes men by forging us into humble servants who are increasingly surrendered to the lordship of Jesus.</p> <p><strong>Q) Why did you include the success and failures from these examples? </strong></p> <p>A) I think God knew that no man would be able to relate to a &#x201c;perfect&#x201d; man in the Bible. By showing their flaws, we can see that these men are not so different from us. In fact, after a thorough reading of the Bible, we can conclude that if God didn&#x2019;t use flawed men, He would have any to use!</p><b>Patrick Morley</b> is one of America&#x2019;s most respected authorities on the challenges and opportunities facing men.

Since its James Beard Award&#x2013;winning first edition, James Peterson&#x2019;s <i>Sauces</i> has remained the go-to reference for professionals and sophisticated home cooks, with nearly 500 recipes and detailed explanations of every kind of sauce. This new edition, published nearly ten years after the previous one, tacks with today&#x2019;s movement toward lighter, fresher flavors and preparations and modern cooking methods, while also elucidating the classic sauces and techniques that remain a foundation of excellence in the kitchen. The updated, streamlined design also features, for the first time, full-color photos that clearly show these essential sauces at every step&#x2014;bringing the author&#x2019;s expertise to life like never before.</p><p><p>The winner of the James Beard Foundation Cookbook of the Year Award when it was first published nearly two decades ago, <em>Sauces </em>is, in the words of Mark Bittman, "the single contemporary reference on the subject that is both comprehensive and comprehensible." Through two successful editions, it has established itself as a modern cookbook classic&#x2014;and an essential reference for every serious cook.</p> <p>James Peterson trained as a chef in France, and the book offers a thorough grounding in the art of classical French sauce making, from veloutï¿½, bï¿½chamel, and demi-glace to hollandaise, mayonnaise, and crï¿½me anglaise. But Peterson also presents a wide variety of lighter contemporary sauces&#x2014;including pan sauces, purï¿½es, and vinaigrettes&#x2014;as well as sauces from around the world, including salsas, pasta sauces, and Asian-style dipping and curry sauces. Best of all, he includes recipes not just for sauces, but for finished dishes. These recipes give Sauces a broader scope, showing how good cooking and sauce making are intimately related&#x2014;and demonstrating how a correctly prepared sauce can transform a well-cooked dish into something truly sublime.</p> <p>Now, with this new edition, Peterson has thoroughly revised and expanded <em>Sauces </em>to make it even more indispensable. You'll find more than sixty all-new recipes for dishes that showcase the leading role of sauces in cooking, such as Chicken Tagine with Harissa Sauce, Osso Buco with Julienned Vegetables, Lobster ï¿½ la Nage, and Gold-Plated Chicken with Ginger, Saffron, and Almonds. There are intriguing historical recipes from medieval and seventeenth-century Europe as well as broth-based classics such as Pot au Feu and Bollito Misto. And, by popular request, Peterson at last includes a recipe for traditional American Roast Turkey with Giblet Gravy.</p> <p>This new edition has been completely redesigned to make it easier to use and includes more than thirty beautiful new color photographs of finished dishes with sauces. If you're a fan of the book's previous editions, you should note that Peterson has not cut any recipes for this edition, and that he has reinstated the popular sauce charts that appeared in the first edition.</p> <p>Lively, erudite, and authoritative, <em>Sauces </em>remains the definitive modern work on the subject. And with this edition's additional recipes&#x2014;there are now a total of 440&#x2014;it is now even more valuable as a general cookbook. You'll find all the techniques and know-how you need to master the art of sauce making, and you'll also discover how sauces can take your cooking to a whole new level. <br></p> <p><strong>Exclusive Recipe Excerpts from <em>Sauces: Classical and Contemporary Sauce Making</em></strong> </p><br><br><table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <br> Bï¿½arnaise and Hollandaise<br></td> <td> <br> Coq Au Vin </td> <td> <br> Pear-Butterscotch Sauce </td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p></p> <p></p><p>Winner of the James Beard Foundation Award for Cookbook of the Year for the 1991 First Edition</p><p>"It's the single contemporary reference on the subject that is both comprehensive and comprehensible.

Deeply researched, brilliantly plotted, and peopled with a cast of unforgettable characters both historical and wholly invented, <em>Cloudsplitter</em> is dazzling in its re-creation of the political and social landscape of our history during the years before the Civil War, when slavery was tearing the country apart. But within this broader scope, Russell Banks has given us a riveting, suspenseful, heartbreaking narrative filled with intimate scenes of domestic life, of violence and action in battle, of romance and familial life and death that make the reader feel in astonishing ways what it is like to be alive in that time.</p></p><p>The cover of Russell Banks's mountain-sized novel <i>Cloudsplitter</i> features an actual photo of Owen Brown, the son of John Brown--the hero of "The Battle Hymn of the Republic" whose terrorist band murdered proponents of slavery in Kansas and attacked Harpers Ferry, Virginia, in 1859 on what he considered direct orders from God, helping spark the Civil War. <p> A deeply researched but fictionalized Owen narrates this remarkably realistic and ambitious novel by the already distinguished author of <i>The Sweet Hereafter</i>. Owen is an atheist, but he is as haunted and dominated by his father, John Brown, as John was haunted by an angry God who demanded human sacrifice to stop the abomination of slavery. <i>Cloudsplitter</i> takes you along on John Brown's journey--as period-perfect as that of the Civil War deserter in <i>Cold Mountain</i>--from Brown's cabin facing the great Adirondack mountain (called "the Cloudsplitter" by the Indians) amid an abolitionist settlement the blacks there call "Timbuctoo," to the various perilous stops of the Underground Railroad spiriting slaves out of the South, and finally to the killings in Bloody Kansas and the Harpers Ferry revolt. We meet some great names--Frederick Douglass, Ralph Waldo Emerson, and a (fictional) lover of Nathaniel Hawthorne--but the vast book keeps a tight focus on the aged Owen's obsessive recollections of his pa's crusade and the emotional shackles John clamped on his own family. </p><p> Banks, a white author, has tackled the topic of race as impressively as Toni Morrison in novels such as <i>Continental Drift</i>. What makes <i>Cloudsplitter</i> a departure for him is its style and scope. He is noted as an exceptionally thorough chronicler of America today in rigorously detailed realist fiction (he championed <i>Snow Falling on Cedars</i>). Banks spent half a decade researching <i>Cloudsplitter</i>, and he renounces the conventional magic of his poetical prose style for a voice steeped in the King James Bible and the stately cadences of 19th-century political rhetoric. The tone is closer to Ken Burns's tragic, elegiac <i>The Civil War</i> than to the recent crazy-quilt modernist novel about John Brown, <i>Raising Holy Hell</i>. </p><p> A fan of Banks's more cut-to-the-chase, Hollywood-hot modern style may get impatient, but such readers can turn to, say, Gore Vidal's recently reissued <i>Lincoln</i>, which peeks into the Great Emancipator's head with a modern's cynical wit. Banks's narrator is poetical and witty at times--Owen notes, "The outrage felt by whites [over slavery] was mostly spent on stoking their own righteousness and warming themselves before its fire." Yet in the main, Banks writes in the "elaborately plainspoken" manner of the Browns, restricting himself to a sober style dictated by the historical subject. </p><p> Besides, John Brown's head resembles the stone tablets of Moses. You do not penetrate him, and you can't declare him mad or sane, good or evil. You read, struggling to locate the words emanating from some strange place between history, heaven, and hell.</p>9 1.5-hour cassettes</p><h2>Smoke and Mirrors: Short Fictions and Illusions</h2><p><p>In the deft hands of Neil Gaiman, magic is no mere illusion . . . and anything is possible. In <em>Smoke and Mirrors</em>, Gaiman's imagination and supreme artistry transform a mundane world into a place of terrible wonders&#x2014;where an old woman can purchase the Holy Grail at a thrift store, where assassins advertise their services in the Yellow Pages under "Pest Control," and where a frightened young boy must barter for his life with a mean-spirited troll living beneath a bridge by the railroad tracks.

It will dazzle your senses, touch your heart, and haunt your dreams.</p></p><p>This anthology of short stories, and the occasional story poem, is vintage Neil Gaiman: quirky, sometimes very funny, often dark and disturbing. Most have been published before, but are hard to find elsewhere and cover all of Gaiman's writing life. As Gaiman says in his introduction, "most of the stories in this book are about love in some form or another," but not requited love. The stories in <i>Smoke and Mirrors</i> touch on all of Gaiman's themes: sex, death, dreams, and the end of the world. From "Chivalry," about the Holy Grail and where it finally ended up, to "Troll Bridge," a very adult version of "The Three Billy Goats Gruff"; from "Bay Wolf," a story poem that melds <i>Beowulf</i> and <i>Baywatch</i>, with interesting results, to "Murder Mysteries," which is about a murder, but also about angels, God's will, and Evil, these stories leave lasting impressions. Fans of Ray Bradbury's short stories and of Gaiman's other works will enjoy this collection. <i>--Nona Vero</i><p>In the deft hands of <strong>Neil Gaiman</strong>, magic is no mere illusion... and anything is possible. In this, Gaiman's first book of short stories, his imagination and supreme artistry transform a mundane world into a place of terrible wonders -- a place where an old woman can purchase the Holy Grail at a thrift store, where assassins advertise their services in the Yellow Pages under "Pest Control," and where a frightened young boy must barter for his life with a mean-spirited troll living beneath a bridge by the railroad tracks.

Then, in a dramatic and electrifying change, described by scientists as &#34;the greatest riddle in human history&#34;, all the skills and qualities that we value most highly in ourselves appeared already fully formed, as though bestowed on us by hidden powers. In &#34;Supernatural&#34;, Graham Hancock sets out to investigate this mysterious &#34;before-and-after moment&#34; and to discover the truth about the influences that gave birth to the modern human mind. His quest takes him on a journey of adventure and detection from the stunningly beautiful painted caves of prehistoric France, Spain and Italy to remote rock shelters in the mountains of South Africa where he finds a treasure trove of extraordinary Stone Age art. He uncovers clues that lead him to travel to the depths of the Amazon rainforest to drink the powerful plant hallucinogen Ayahuasca with Indian shamans, whose paintings contain images of &#34;supernatural beings&#34; identical to the animal-human hybrids depicted in prehistoric caves and rock shelters. And hallucinogens such as mescaline, also produce visionary encounters with exactly the same beings. Scientists at the cutting edge of consciousness research have begun to consider the possibility that such hallucinations may be real perceptions of other &#34;dimensions&#34;. Could the &#34;supernaturals&#34; first depicted in the painted caves and rock shelters be the ancient teachers of mankind? Could it be that human evolution is not just the &#34;blind&#34;, &#34;meaningless&#34; process that Darwin identified, but something else, more purposive and intelligent, that we have barely even begun to understand?</p><p>Graham Hancock is the author of the major international bestsellers The Sign and The Seal, Fingerprints of the Godsand Heaven&#39;s Mirror. His books have sold more than five million copies worldwide and have been translated into 27 languages. His public lectures and TV appearances, including the three-hour series Quest For The Lost Civilization, have put his ideas before audiences of tens of millions. He has become recognized as an unconventional thinker who raises legitimate questions about humanity&#39;s history and prehistory and offers an increasingly popular view of our shared history.<b>The Plant that Enables Men to See the Dead <br></b> <br>I lay on a couch in the darkened drawing room of a 200-year-old townhouse in the English city of Bath. The streets outside were deserted and offered few clues to remind me of the familiar world. It was reassuring to find that I could still read the luminous dial of my wristwatch if I held it in front of my eyes. Ten minutes passed, then 20, then 35. I began to feel bored, restless, even a little blasï¿½ After 45 minutes I closed my eyes and directed my thoughts inwards towards contemplation, still noticing nothing unusual. But at the end of the first hour of my vigil, when I tried to stand up and walk around, I was amazed to discover that my legs would not work. Out of nowhere, an enervating feebleness had ambushed my limbs, the slightest physical effort set off uncontrollable tremors and stumbling, and I had completely lost my sense of balance. <br> <br>A wave of giddiness and nausea washed over me and I fell back exhausted on the couch, drenched in cold sweat. I remembered with a shudder of finality that I could not change my mind because there was no antidote. Once it was underway, the process I was going through could not be stopped and would simply have to be endured. <br> <br>My hearing was the next faculty affected. At intervals, there would be a tremendous ringing and buzzing in my ears, blotting out all other sounds. My eyesight also rapidly deteriorated, soon becoming so obstructed at the edges with strange black lines, like fence-posts or gratings, that I could no longer see my watch and had to abandon all control of time. For what felt like a very long while the poison remorselessly tightened its grip and I fell prey to indescribable sensations of physical and psychic unease. There was a great deal of pain, weakness and discomfort. It was as if my body were being slowly and systematically smashed and dismembered and I began to fear that I might never be able to put it back together again. <br> <br>In a moment of stillness when my eyes were closed a vision popped up&#x2013;a vivid moving tapestry of intertwining branches and leaves, elaborate arabesques and Celtic knotwork. I blinked my eyes open. Instantly the writhing patterns vanished and the darkened drawing room returned. But as soon as I closed my eyes the patterns came back. <br> <br>More unmeasured time passed while the patterns continued to expand and multiply. Then another great gust of dizziness hit me and I winced at the terrifying new sensation it brought of balancing on a swaying tightrope over a bottomless abyss. I found that if I lay on my back, looked straight up at the ceiling and stayed absolutely still I could minimise these uncomfortable effects. But all it took was the slightest movement of my head to left or right to bring on another spectacular surge of vertigo. <br> <br>When at last I closed my eyes again the sinuous intertwined patterns reappeared with renewed intensity and then were abruptly overwritten by a profile view of a heavily built blond young man with his eyes turned towards me in a glare of reproach. He appeared right at my side, startlingly close. His skin was pallid and his brow blotched with patches of green mould. <br> <br> <b>Shamanic portals </b> <br> <br>In the Central African countries of Gabon, Cameroon and Zaire certain age-old ancestor cults still flourish in the twenty-first century. Their members share a common belief, based they say on direct experience, in the existence of a supernatural realm where the spirits of the dead may be contacted. Like some hypothetical dimension of quantum physics, this otherworld interpenetrates our own and yet cannot ordinarily be seen or verified by empirical tests. It is therefore a matter of great interest, with highly suggestive research implications, that tribal shamans claim to have mastered a means, through the consumption of a poisonous shrub known locally as eboka or iboga, by which humans may reach the otherworld and return alive. How they mastered this skill is told in the origin myth of the indigenous secret society known as the Bwiti: <br>Zame ye Mebege [the last of the creator gods] gave us <i>Eboka</i>. One day . . . he saw . . . the Pygmy Bitamu, high in an Atanga tree, gathering its fruit. He made him fall. He died, and Zame brought his spirit to him. Zame cut off the little fingers and little toes of the cadaver of the Pygmy and planted them in various parts of the forest. They grew into the <i>Eboka </i>bush. <br>The pygmy&#x2019;s wife was named Atanga. When she heard of the death of her husband she went in search of his body. Eventually, after many adventures, she came to a cave in the heart of the forest in which she saw a pile of human bones: <br>As she entered the cave she suddenly heard a voice &#x2014; as of the voice of her husband &#x2014; asking who she was, where she came from, and whom she wished to speak with. The voice told her to look to the left at the mouth of the cave. There was the <i>Eboka </i>plant. The voice told her to eat its roots . . . She ate and felt very tired . . . Then she was told to turn around in the cave. The bones were gone and in their place stood her husband and other dead relatives. They talked to her and gave her a [new] name, <i>Disoumba</i>, and told her that she had found the plant that would enable men to see the dead. This was the first baptism into Bwiti and that was how men got the power to know the dead and have their counsel. <br>Today several million people distributed across Gabon, Cameroon and Zaire have no difficulty resisting well-financed efforts at conversion aimed at them by Christian and Islamic missionaries. Their allegiance instead is to the Bwiti, into which they have been initiated by consuming huge amounts of eboka root-bark shavings and experiencing a journey into supernatural realms. <br> <br>Eboka, also known as iboga (the spelling that I will use from now on), is classified scientifically as <i>Tabernanthe iboga </i>and is a member of the <i>Apocynacae </i>(Dogbane) family. Its root bark turns out to be very special, as the myth of the pygmy asserts, and contains more than a dozen unusual chemicals belonging to a class known as the indole alkaloids. One of them, ibogaine, is the potent hallucinogen responsible for the convincing and life-changing visions experienced by Bwiti initiates, notably &#x2018;encounters with supernatural beings&#x2019; and &#x2018;encounters with the spirits of the dead&#x2019;. Many report meeting their deceased fathers or grandfathers, who act as guides for them in the spirit world. However, the bark must be eaten in toxic quantities if the visionary state is to be attained, and initiates confront an ever-present risk of fatal overdose as they seek out their ancestors. <br> <br> <b>Research <br></b> <br>Even without the barbaric threat of a jail sentence, ibogaine is a very serious business, so I had not gone lightly into the decisions that had led me to this couch, this night, and this state of helpless prostration to whatever was coming next. <br> <br> <br> <i>From the Hardcover edition.</i></p><h2>Past Tense: A Jack Reacher Novel</h2><p><b>#1 <i>NEW YORK TIMES </i>BESTSELLER </b>ï¿½&nbsp;<b>Family secrets come back to haunt Jack Reacher in this electrifying thriller from &#x201c;a superb craftsman of suspense&#x201d; (<i>Entertainment Weekly</i>).</b><br><br> Jack Reacher hits the pavement and sticks out his thumb.

But not, he thought, straight down the coast. Not like the orioles and the buntings and the phoebes and the warblers and the ruby-ï¿½throated hummingbirds. Instead he decided on a diagonal route, south and west, from the top right-ï¿½hand corner of the country to the bottom left, maybe through Syracuse, and Cincinnati, and St. Louis, and Oklahoma City, and Albuquerque, and onward all the way to San Diego. Which for an army guy like Reacher was a little too full of Navy people, but which was otherwise a fine spot to start the winter.<br><br>It would be an epic road trip, and one he hadn&#x2019;t made in years.<br><br>He was looking forward to it.<br><br>He didn&#x2019;t get far.<br><br>He walked inland a mile or so and came to a county road and stuck out his thumb. He was a tall man, more than six feet five in his shoes, heavily built, all bone and muscle, not particularly good looking, never very well dressed, usually a little unkempt. Not an overwhelmingly appealing proposition. As always most drivers slowed and took a look and then kept on going. The first car prepared to take a chance on him came along after forty minutes. It was a year-ï¿½old Subaru wagon, driven by a lean middle-ï¿½aged guy in pleated chino pants and a crisp khaki shirt. Dressed by his wife, Reacher thought. The guy had a wedding ring. But under the fine fabrics was a workingman&#x2019;s body. A thick neck and large red knuckles. The slightly surprised and somewhat reluctant boss of something, Reacher thought. The kind of guy who starts out digging post holes and ends up owning a fencing company.<br><br>Which turned out to be a good guess. Initial conversation established the guy had started out with nothing to his name but his daddy&#x2019;s old framing hammer, and had ended up owning a construction company, responsible for forty working people, and the hopes and dreams of a whole bunch of clients. He finished his story with a little facial shrug, part Yankee modesty, part genuine perplexity. As in, how did that happen? Attention to detail, Reacher thought. This was a very organized guy, full of notions and nostrums and maxims and cast-ï¿½iron beliefs, one of which was that at the end of summer it was better to stay away from both Route One and I-ï¿½95, and in fact to get out of Maine altogether as fast as possible, which meant soon and sideways, on Route Two, straight west into New Hampshire. To a place just south of Berlin, where the guy knew a bunch of back roads that would get them down to Boston faster than any other way. Which was where the guy was going, for a meeting about marble countertops. Reacher was happy. Nothing wrong with Boston as a starting point. Nothing at all. From there it was a straight shot to Syracuse. After which Cincinnati was easy, via Rochester and Buffalo and Cleveland. Maybe even via Akron, Ohio. Reacher had been in worse places. Mostly in the service.<br><br>They didn&#x2019;t get to Boston.<br><br>The guy got a call on his cell, after fifty-ï¿½some minutes heading south on the aforementioned New Hampshire back roads. Which were exactly as advertised. Reacher had to admit the guy&#x2019;s plan was solid. There was no traffic at all. No jams, no delays. They were bowling along, doing sixty miles an hour, dead easy. Until the phone rang. It was hooked up to the car radio, and a name came up on the navigation screen, with a thumbnail photograph as a visual aid, in this case of a red-ï¿½faced man wearing a hard hat and carrying a clipboard. Some kind of a foreman on a job site. The guy at the wheel touched a button and phone hiss filled the car, from all the speakers, like surround sound.<br><br>The guy at the wheel spoke to the windshield pillar and said, &#x201c;This better be good news.&#x201d;<br><br>It wasn&#x2019;t. It was something to do with an inspector from a municipal buildings department, and a metal flue liner above a fireplace in an entrance lobby, which was properly insulated, exactly up to code, except that couldn&#x2019;t be proved visually without tearing down the stonework, which was by that point already three stories high, nearly done, with the masons booked on a new job starting the next week, or alternatively without ripping out the custom walnut millwork in the dining room on the other side of the chimney, or the millwork in the closet above, which was rosewood and even more complicated, but the inspector was being a hardass about it and needed to see for himself.<br><br>The guy at the wheel glanced at Reacher and said, &#x201c;Which inspector is it?&#x201d;<br><br>The guy on the phone said, &#x201c;The new one.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Does he know he gets a turkey at Thanksgiving?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I told him we&#x2019;re all on the same side here.&#x201d;<br><br>The guy at the wheel glanced at Reacher again, as if seeking permission, or offering an apology, or both, and then he faced front again and said, &#x201c;Did you offer him money?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Five hundred. He wouldn&#x2019;t take it.&#x201d;<br><br>Then the cell signal ran out. The sound went garbled, like a robot drowning in a swimming pool, and then it went dead. The screen said it was searching.<br><br>The car rolled on.<br><br>Reacher said, &#x201c;Why would a person want a fireplace in an entrance lobby?&#x201d;<br><br>The guy at the wheel said, &#x201c;It&#x2019;s welcoming.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I think historically it was designed to repel. It was defensive. Like the campfire burning in the mouth of the cave. It was intended to keep predators at bay.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I have to go back,&#x201d; the guy said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry.&#x201d;<br><br>He slowed the car and pulled over on the gravel. All alone, on the back roads. No other traffic. The screen said it was still searching for a signal.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m going to have to let you out here,&#x201d; the guy said. &#x201c;Is that OK?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No problem,&#x201d; Reacher said. &#x201c;You got me part of the way. For which I thank you very much.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re welcome.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Whose is the rosewood closet?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;His.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Cut a big hole in it and show the inspector. Then give the client five commonsense reasons why he should install a wall safe. Because this is a guy who wants a wall safe. Maybe he doesn&#x2019;t know it yet, but a guy who wants a fireplace in his entrance lobby wants a wall safe in his bedroom closet. That&#x2019;s for damn sure. Human nature. You&#x2019;ll make a profit. You can charge him for the time it takes to cut the hole.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Are you in this business, too?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I was a military cop.&#x201d;<br><br>The guy said, &#x201c;Huh.&#x201d;<br><br>Reacher opened the door and climbed out, and closed the door again behind him, and walked far enough away to give the guy space to swing the Subaru around, gravel shoulder to gravel shoulder, across the whole width of the road, and then to take off back the way he had come. All of which the guy did, with a brief gesture Reacher took to be a rueful good-ï¿½luck wave. Then he got smaller and smaller in the distance, and Reacher turned back and continued walking, south, the way he was headed. Wherever possible he liked to maintain forward momentum. The road he was on was a two-ï¿½lane, wide enough, well maintained, curved here and there, a little up and down. But no kind of a problem for a modern car. The Subaru had been doing sixty. Yet there was no traffic. None at all. Nothing coming, either way. Total silence. Just a sigh of wind in the trees, and the faint buzz of heat coming up off the blacktop.<br><br>Reacher walked on.<br><br>Two miles later the road he was on curved gently left, and a new road of equal size and appearance split off to the right. Not exactly a turn. More like an equal choice. A classic Y-ï¿½shaped junction. Twitch the wheel left, or twitch the wheel right. Your call. Both options ran out of sight through trees so mighty in places they made a tunnel.<br><br>There was a road sign.<br><br>A tilted arrow to the left was labeled Portsmouth, and a tilted arrow to the right was labeled Laconia. But the right-ï¿½hand option was written in smaller writing, and it had a smaller arrow, as if Laconia was less important than Portsmouth. A mere byway, despite its road being the same size.<br><br>Laconia, New Hampshire.<br><br>A name Reacher knew. He had seen it on all kinds of historic family paperwork, and he had heard it mentioned from time to time. It was his late father&#x2019;s place of birth, and where he was raised, until he escaped at age seventeen to join the Marines. Such was the vague family legend. Escaped from what had not been specified. But he never went back. Not once. Reacher himself had been born more than fifteen years later, by which time Laconia was a dead detail of the long-ï¿½ago past, as remote as the Dakota Territory, where it was said some earlier ancestor had lived and worked. No one in the family ever went to either place. No visits. The grandparents died young and were rarely mentioned. There were apparently no aunts or uncles or cousins or any other kind of distant relatives. Which was statistically unlikely, and suggested a rift of some kind. But no one other than his father had any real information, and no one ever made any real attempt to get any from him. Certain things were not discussed in Marine families. Much later as a captain in the army Reacher&#x2019;s brother Joe was posted north and said something about maybe trying to find the old family homestead, but nothing ever came of it. Probably Reacher himself had said the same kind of thing, from time to time. He had never been there either.<br><br>Left or right. His call.<br><br>Portsmouth was better. It had highways and traffic and buses. It was a straight shot to Boston. San Diego beckoned. The Northeast was about to get cold.<br><br>But what was one extra day?<br><br>He stepped right, and chose the fork in the road that led to Laconia.<br><br>At that same late-ï¿½afternoon moment, nearly thirty miles away, heading south on a different back road, was a worn-ï¿½out Honda Civic, driven by a twenty-ï¿½five-ï¿½year-ï¿½old man named Shorty Fleck. Next to him in the passenger seat was a twenty-ï¿½five-ï¿½year-ï¿½old woman named Patty Sundstrom. They were boyfriend and girlfriend, both born and raised in Saint Leonard, which was a small faraway town in New Brunswick, Canada. Not much happened there. The biggest news in living memory was ten years previously, when a truck carrying twelve million bees overturned on a curve. The local paper reported with pride that the accident was the first of its kind in New Brunswick. Patty worked in a sawmill. She was the granddaughter of a guy from Minnesota who had slipped north half a century earlier, to beat the draft for Vietnam. Shorty was a potato farmer. His family had been in Canada forever. And he wasn&#x2019;t particularly short. Maybe he had been once, as a kid. But now he figured he was what any eyewitness would call an average-ï¿½looking guy.<br><br>They were trying to make it non-ï¿½stop from Saint Leonard to New York City. Which by any standard was a hardcore drive. But they saw a big advantage in doing it. They had something to sell in the city, and saving a night in a hotel would maximize their profit. They had planned out their route, looping west to avoid the summer people heading home from the beaches, using back roads, Patty&#x2019;s blunt finger on a map, her gaze ranging ahead for turns and signs. They had timed it out on paper, and figured it was a feasible course of action.<br><br>Except they had gotten a later start than they would have liked, due a little bit to general disorganization, but mostly due to the Honda&#x2019;s aging battery not liking the newly crisp autumnal temperatures blowing in from the direction of Prince Edward Island. The delay put them in a long line at the U.S. border, and then the Honda started overï¿½heating, and needed nursing along below fifty miles an hour for an extended spell.<br><br>They were tired.<br><br>And hungry, and thirsty, and in need of the bathroom, and late, and behind schedule. And frustrated. The Honda was overheating again. The needle was kissing the red. There was a grinding noise under the hood. Maybe the oil was low. No way of telling. All the dashboard lights had been on continuously for the last two and a half years.<br><br>Shorty asked, &#x201c;What&#x2019;s up ahead?&#x201d;<br><br>Patty said, &#x201c;Nothing.&#x201d;<br><br>Her fingertip was on a wandering red line, which was labeled with a three-ï¿½digit number, and which was shown running north to south through a jagged shape shaded pale green. A forested area. Which matched what was out the window. The trees crowded in, still and dark, laden down with heavy end-ï¿½of-ï¿½summer leaves. The map showed tiny red spider-ï¿½web lines here and there, like the veins in an old lady&#x2019;s leg, which were presumably all tracks to somewhere, but nowhere big. Nowhere likely to have a mechanic or a lube shop or radiator water. The best bet was about thirty minutes ahead, some ways east of south, a town with its name printed not too small and semi-ï¿½bold, which meant it had to have at least a gas station. It was called Laconia.</p><h2>Butterflies (Peterson Field Guides: Young Naturalists)</h2><p>This new series is based on the Peterson Identification System, which uses life-like illustrations to help young naturalists make accurate identifications.

They are must reads for any romance reader, for any lover of Arthurian legend, for any history buff, for any voracious reader, and may be the books to get non-readers started. Basically, they should be read by everyone! Mary Stewart&#39;s research is phenomenal. Her understanding of myth and its relationship to fact is remarkable. The books are complex, yet incredibly inviting and you will absolutely love the characters. They also weave together so beautifully that you won&#39;t be able to read only one. Two things I find particularly interesting in this series is the portrayal of Arthur and the fall of Camelot. Arthur represents all of humanity in these books as opposed to the more mythical figure you usually see. And the fall of Camelot is more internal rather than external--more about the passions and lusts in the heart rather than a more obvious loss of power. The books go in this order: The Crystal Cave, The Hollow Hills, The Last Enchantment, The Wicked Day.

In this volume, Russell&#x2019;s various essays are brought together in one place in order to provide a useful and expansive resource to those interested in better understanding the ways in which the modern phenomenon of disability is shaped by capitalist economic and social relations. The essays range in analysis from the theoretical to the topical, including but not limited to: the emergence of disability as a &#x201c;human category&#x201d; rooted in the rise of industrial capitalism and the transformation of the conditions of work, family, and society corresponding thereto; a critique of the shortcomings of a purely &#x201c;civil rights approach&#x201d; to addressing the persistence of disability oppression in the economic sphere, with a particular focus on the legacy of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990; an examination of the changing position of disabled people within the overall system of capitalist production utilizing the Marxist economic concepts of the reserve army of the unemployed, the labor theory of value, and the exploitation of wage-labor; the effects of neoliberal capitalist policies on the living conditions and social position of disabled people as it pertains to welfare, income assistance, health care, and other social security programs; imperialism and war as a factor in the further oppression and immiseration of disabled people within the United States and globally; and the need to build unity against the divisive tendencies which hide the common economic interest shared between disabled people and the often highly-exploited direct care workers who provide services to the former.</p></p><p><p>Keith Rosenthal is a socialist writer and activist.

But leadership should not reside in a single pastor. The biblical model for church leadership is found in teams of elders who together guide the community into God&#39;s mission. Church leaders J.R. Briggs and Bob Hyatt provide a comprehensive picture of elders as agents of mission for their communities. Healthy eldership structures a church for mission, as elder teams model the kind of community the local church is intended to be and steward the gospel in a local context. Looking at eldership through a missiological lens, Briggs and Hyatt unpack the role, character and posture of a mission-oriented elder. Elders oversee, shepherd, teach, equip and model for God?s people what life with Jesus looks like in a particular context. Including a study guide that elder teams can work through together, the authors provide practical guidance for how elders are selected, work together, make decisions, protect the congregation and invest in the lives of others. Discover here a clear vision for what it means to be a faithful elder. May it help you and your church thrive in pursuing God&#39;s mission in the world.</p><p>"Hyatt and Briggs are like chiropractors for the church. They describe eldership as the church's 'bone structure,' which today is often in sore need of alignment and adjustment. They align the fundamental value of eldership by affirming its biblical purpose and the elders' commitment to God's mission in ordinary, everyday lives. Then they offer adjustments by unpacking in very practical and relevant ways what mission-minded elders look like, what derails them, how they create healthy culture, and then how elders manage the challenges that come, ultimately addressing the question of women elders. I found this book very helpful, and recommend it as an important resource for every church that wants a healthier, more active leadership structure." (MaryKate Morse, author, Making Room for Leadership, professor of leadership and spiritual formation, George Fox Evangelical Seminary)<br><br>"The church has been in need of an updated understanding of eldership. With seasoned wisdom and theological rigor, Hyatt and Briggs team up to shift the role of elders from being a domesticated business board that focuses on maintenance, to a daring community of servant leaders who equip the whole church to join God's mission in the world. This is the best book I've read on eldership." (JR Woodward, national director, The V3 Movement; author of Creating a Missional Culture)<br><br>"If your church's eldership basically operates like the board of directors of a small religious enterprise, get them to read this book. Quick. J.R. Briggs and Bob Hyatt not only outline the biblical functions of eldership but they do so through the missional prism that the original biblical writers used. For them, eldership is missional insofar as elders are called to not only equip the church for mission but to eliminate as many factors as possible that could derail the missional orientation of the church. Biblical, practical, warm and inspiring." (Michael Frost, Morling College, Sydney; author of The Road to Missional, Incarnate and Exiles)<br><br>"J.R. and Bob give us something that few&#x2015;if any&#x2015;books on church eldership have offered before: an accessible mission-directed primer on faithful leadership in localized, contextualized Jesus communities. . . . My hope is that this book will compel us to forego the prevalent version of decaffeinated Christianity and instead cultivate a missionary ethos that ignites faith communities to participate in the unrestrained and uncorked adventure of life with Jesus." (From the foreword by Alan Hirsch, missiologist, speaker, founding director of Forge Network and author of The Forgotten Ways)<br><br>"The central theme of mission feels more paramount today than ever. Hyatt and Briggs have taken the indispensable biblical-cultural discussion of leadership beneath 'corporate strategies' and 'personality attraction' and have instead deep-rooted eldership in humble, courageous and contextualized co-missioning with the Master. This is a book for church influencers everywhere." (Tony Kriz, author of Aloof: Figuring Out Life with a God Who Hides, tonykriz.com)<br><br>"The missional church can often overlook the importance of eldership and governance. Hyatt and Briggs show us how vital these questions are in order for outward mission to be sustained. They provide a biblically rooted and mission-centered vision for eldership. The parts about the character, qualifications, and selection of elders were particularly helpful for me as a pastor." (Aaron Graham, lead pastor, The District Church)<br><br>"Intensely practical, thoroughly rich in wisdom, <em>Eldership and the Mission of God</em> is a book on church leadership that defies its stereotype. As well-honed practitioners and careful thinkers, Briggs and Hyatt recast everything about elder work for its call to mission. I wish I'd had this book twenty years ago." (David Fitch, Betty R.

As a staple of the tours, guides entertain paying customers by routinely relying on stories of enslaved black specters. But who are these ghosts? Examining popular sites and stories from these tours, Miles shows that haunted tales routinely appropriate and skew African American history to produce representations of slavery for commercial gain. "Dark tourism" often highlights the most sensationalist and macabre aspects of slavery, from salacious sexual ties between white masters and black women slaves to the physical abuse and torture of black bodies to the supposedly exotic nature of African spiritual practices. Because the realities of slavery are largely absent from these tours, Miles reveals how they continue to feed problematic "Old South" narratives and erase the hard truths of the Civil War era. In an incisive and engaging work, Miles uses these troubling cases to shine light on how we feel about the Civil War and race, and how the ghosts of the past are still with us.<br><br></p><p>Tiya Miles is Elsa Barkley Brown Collegiate Professor at the University of Michigan.Investigating southern fright culture, Tiya Miles uncovers the connections between antebellum nostalgia, African American history, and mystical ideas about slavery.

Colter became a successful recording artist, appearing on <em>American Bandstand</em> and befriending stars such as the Everly Brothers and Chet Atkins, while her songs were recorded by Nancy Sinatra, Dottie West, and others. Her marriage to Eddy didn&#x2019;t last, however, and in 1969 she married the electrifying Waylon Jennings. Together, they made their home in Nashville which in the 1970s, was ground zero for roots music, drawing Bob Dylan, Johnny Cash, Willie Nelson, Kris Kristofferson, Shel Silverstein, and others to the Nashville Sound. And Jessi was at the center of it all, the only woman on the landmark <em>Wanted: The Outlaws</em> album, the record that launched the Outlaw Country genre and was the first country album to go platinum. She also tasted personal commercial success with the #1-single &#x201c;I&#x2019;m Not Lisa.&#x201d;</p><p>But offstage, life was a challenge, as Waylon pursued his addictions and battled his demons. Having drifted from the church as a young woman, Jessi returned to her faith and found in it a source of strength in the turmoil of living with Waylon. In the 1980s, Waylon helped launch the super group The Highwaymen with Willie Nelson, Johnny Cash, and Kris Kristofferson, and the hits kept rolling, as did Waylon&#x2019;s reckless living.

Ranging widely across premodern European thought and culture, Leah DeVun reveals how and why efforts to define &#x201c;the human&#x201d; so often hinged on ideas about hermaphrodites.<br><br>DeVun examines a host of thinkers&#x2015;theologians, cartographers, natural philosophers, lawyers, poets, surgeons, and alchemists&#x2015;who used ideas about hermaphrodites as conceptual tools to order their political, cultural, and natural worlds. She reconstructs the cultural landscape navigated by individuals whose sex or gender did not fit the binary alongside debates about animality, sexuality, race, religion, and human nature. <i>The Shape of Sex</i> charts an embrace of hermaphroditism in early Christianity, its brutal erasure at the turn of the thirteenth century, and a new enthusiasm for hermaphroditic transformations at the dawn of the Renaissance. Along the way, DeVun explores beliefs that Adam and Jesus were hermaphrodites; images of &#x201c;monstrous races&#x201d; in encyclopedias, maps, and illuminated manuscripts; justifications for violence against purportedly hermaphroditic outsiders such as Jews and Muslims; and the surgical &#x201c;correction&#x201d; of bodies that seemed to flout binary divisions.<br><br>In a moment when questions about sex, gender, and identity have become incredibly urgent, <i>The Shape of Sex</i> casts new light on a complex and often contradictory past. It shows how premodern thinkers created a system of sex and embodiment that both anticipates and challenges modern beliefs about what it means to be male, female&#x2015;and human.</p><p>Leah DeVun is associate professor of history at Rutgers University. She is the author of<i> Prophecy, Alchemy, and the End of Time: John of Rupescissa in the Late Middle Ages</i> (Columbia, 2009) and was coeditor of <i>Trans*historicities</i> (2018), an issue of <i>TSQ: Transgender Studies Quarterly</i>.<i>The Shape of Sex</i> is beautifully written, elegantly argued, and accessible to specialists and nonspecialists alike. Leah DeVun's use of case studies draws the reader in, her sophisticated elaborations of the import of the material show her familiarity with gender theory today as well as in the past. I especially value the book's attention to the intersection of race and gender. This will be the major study of the topic for many years to come.

He also demonstrates how the Qabalah is applicable to all mystical traditions and religious beliefs, including Christian mysticism, Greek, Egyptian and Celtic mythologies, and even Native American beliefs. It is indeed symbolic of our universal search for the Divine. Included here are two books in one. The first compares the Western Mystery Tradition with the Eastern system of yoga, analyzes the Tree of Life in full detail, and describes the practical application and theories of Qabalistic symbolism. The second gives the most comprehensive analysis ever published of the twenty-two &#39;Paths of Concealed Glory&#39; that join the Spheres of the Tree of Life taking into account the Hebrew alphabet, astrological signs, and tarot trumps.

But in <em>The Waters of Eternal Youth</em>, the 25th novel in this celebrated series, Brunetti finds himself drawn into a case that may not be a case at all.</p> <p>Fifteen years ago, a teenage girl fell into a canal late at night. Unable to swim, she went under and started to drown. She survived thanks to a nearby man, an alcoholic, who heard her splashes and pulled her out, though not before she suffered irreparable brain damage that left her unable to learn or mature. The drunk man claimed he saw her thrown into the canal, but the following day he couldn&#x2019;t remember a thing.</p> <p>Now, at a fundraising dinner for a Venetian charity, a wealthy and aristocratic patroness&#x2015;the girl&#x2019;s grandmother&#x2015;asks Brunetti if he will investigate. Brunetti&#x2019;s not sure what to do. If a crime was committed, the criminal surely would be protected by the statute of limitations. But out of a mixture of curiosity, pity, and a willingness to fulfill the wishes of a guilt-wracked older woman, Brunetti agrees.</p> <p>Brunetti soon finds himself unable to let the case rest, if indeed there is a case. Awash in the rhythms and concerns of contemporary Venetian life, from historical preservation to housing to new waves of African migrants to the haunting story of a woman trapped in a damaged perpetual childhood, <em>The Waters of Eternal Youth</em> is an exquisite novel, perfect to mark twenty-five years of this beloved series.</p></p><p><b>Donna Leon</b> is the author of the highly acclaimed, internationally bestselling Commissario Guido Brunetti mystery series.

What I really am, Nell thought as she printed off the tickets, gazing at them, then tucking them into a folder with all the important information, is the kind of girl who goes to Paris for the weekend.<br><br>As the big day grew nearer, she started to enjoy dropping it into conversation. "Got to make sure my passport is up-to-date," she said when she left her mother after Sunday lunch. She bought new underwear, shaved her legs, painted her toenails a vivid shade of red (she usually went for clear). "Don't forget I'm leaving early on Friday," she said at work. "You know. For Paris."<br><br>"Oh, you're so lucky," chorused the girls in Accounts.<br><br>"I'm well jell," said Trish, who disliked Pete slightly less than everyone else.<br><br>-<br><br>Nell climbs onto the train and stows her bag, wondering how "jell" Trish would be if she could see her now: a girl beside an empty seat going to Paris with no idea whether her boyfriend was even going to turn up.</p><h2>On the Soul and the Resurrection: St Gregory of Nyssa (Popular Patristics)</h2><p>The resurrection of the body, perhaps more than any other Christian doctrine, requires us to face the implications of faith for our personal lives and for our understanding of the world.' This issue faced St Paul in his dealing with the early church and also troubles St Gregory of Nyssa in the fourth century AD. St Gregory, educated in the prevailing Greek philosophical system, yearned to synthesize his faith and his philosophy. Struggling with the issue of resurrection, he followed Plato's example and dramatized the interior workings of his mind in dialogue form, in which his elder sister St Macrina plays the role of teacher. <p>The position which Gregory and Macrina eventually reach corresponds essentially to that of St Paul, namely that our bodies will rise again as bodies, but in a finer and more glorious form than we have now. Expressing this belief in terms of Greek silence, the dialogue assumes that the same physical elements which compose our present bodies much be reassembled in our resurrection bodies; otherwise our bodies would be recreated rather than raised. 'On the Soul and the Resurrection' is part of the POPULAR PATRISTIC SERIES.</p></p><p></p><h2>Pym: A Novel</h2><p><b><b>&#x201c;THE SHARPEST AND MOST UNUSUAL STORY I READ LAST YEAR . . .

Determined to seek out Tsalal, the remote island of pure and utter blackness that Poe describes, Jaynes convenes an all-black crew of six to follow Pym&#x2019;s trail to the South Pole, armed with little but the firsthand account from which Poe derived his seafaring tale, a bag of bones, and a stash of Little Debbie snack cakes.

Johnson is a faculty member at the University of Houston Creative Writing Program and lives in Texas with his wife and children.chapter I<br><br>Always thought if I didn&#x2019;t get tenure I would shoot myself or strap a bomb to my chest and walk into the faculty cafeteria, but when it happened I just got bourbon drunk and cried a lot and rolled into a ball on my office floor. A couple days of this and I couldn&#x2019;t take it so I ended classes a week early and checked into the Akwaaba Bed and Breakfast in Harlem to be among my own race and party away the pain. But mostly I just found myself back in that same ball some more, still on the floor, just at a more historically resonant address. My buddy Garth Frierson, he&#x2019;d been laid off about six months before, and was nice enough to drive all the way from Detroit to help a childhood friend. This help mostly consisted of him sitting his bus driver ass on my rented bed, busting on me until I had enough shame to get off my own duff and try to make something of myself again.<br><br>By then the term was over, graduation done, campus vacant. I didn&#x2019;t want to see anybody. The only things worse than the ones who were happy about my dismissal were the ones that weren&#x2019;t. The sympathy, the condolences. It was all so white. I was the only black male professor on campus. Professor of African American Literature. Professional Negro. Over the years since my original hire I pushed away from that and insisted on teaching American literature in general, following a path toward my passion, toward Edgar Allan Poe. Specifically, I offered the course &#x201c;Dancing with the Darkies: Whiteness in the Literary Mind&#x201d; twice a year, regardless of enrollment. In regard to the number of students who chose to attend the seminar, I must say in my defense that the greatest ideas are often presented to empty chairs. However, a different theory on proper class size was cited in my denial letter from the president, and given as a reason to overturn the faculty&#x2019;s approval.<br><br>Curing America&#x2019;s racial pathology couldn&#x2019;t be done with good intentions or presidential elections. Like all diseases, it had to be analyzed at a microscopic level. What I discovered during my studies in Poe&#x2019;s and other early Americans&#x2019; texts was the intellectual source of racial Whiteness. Here, in these pages, was the very fossil record of how this odd and illogical sickness formed. Here was the twisted mythic underpinnings of modern racial thought that could never before be dismantled because we were standing on them. You don&#x2019;t cure an illness by ignoring it or just fighting the symptoms. A Kleenex has never eradicated a cold. I was doing essential work, work affecting domestic policy, foreign policy, the entire social fabric of the most powerful nation of the world. Work that related directly to the way we lived our daily lives and perceived reality itself. Who cared if a bunch of overprivileged nineteen-year-olds with questionable hygiene could be bothered to rise for the 8 a.m. class? Who cared if I chose to not waste even more precious research time attending the toothless Diversity Committee?<br><br>&#x201c;Just get your books, dog. And get out of there. Pack up your place, focus on what you can do. You want, you can come back with me to Detroit. It&#x2019;s cheap, I got a big crib. Ain&#x2019;t no jobs, but still.&#x201d; Garth and I drove up the Taconic in the rain. I was still drunk, and the wet road was like lines on a snake&#x2019;s back and my stomach was going to spill. Even drunk, I knew any escape plan that involved going to Detroit, Michigan, was a harbinger of doom. Garth Frierson was my boy, from when we were boys, from when I lived in a basement apartment in Philly and he lived over the laundromat next door. Garth didn&#x2019;t even ask how many books I had, but he must have suspected.<br><br>Because I had books. I had books like a lit professor has books. And then I had more books, finer books. First editions. Rare prints. Copies signed by hands long dead. Angela walked out on me a long time ago and my chance of children walked with her, but I had multiplied in my own way. I&#x2019;d had shelves built in my office for these books, shelves ten feet tall and completely lining the drywall.<br><br>The campus was dead. A vacant compound hidden from the road by darkness and hulking pines. The gravel parking lot was empty, but I made Garth park in the spot that said president&#x2014;?violators will be towed on principle. When you get denied tenure at a college like this&#x2014;intimate, good but not great&#x2014;your career is over. A decade of job preparation, and no one else will hire you. If you haven&#x2019;t published enough, people assume tenure denial means you never will. If you have published and were still denied, people assume you&#x2019;re an asshole. Nobody wants to give a job for life to an asshole. And they didn&#x2019;t have to in this economy. Outside of a miracle, after denial I would be lucky to scrounge up adjunct teaching at a community college somewhere cold, barren, and far from the ocean. A life of little health insurance, bill collector calls, and classrooms with metal detectors, all compliments of this college president, Mr. Bowtie. The least I could do was shit in his space for an hour.<br><br>We trudged. The building looked like an old church that had lost its faith, every step up the stairs a sacrilege. Garth huffed, but followed. I&#x2019;d chosen an office in the back of the top floor to dissuade students, but my lectures had done a better job of this. My office was a narrow A-framed cathedral with a matching window. A shrine to the books that lined the walls and my own solitude.<br><br>&#x201c;Bro, I&#x2019;m not going to lie to you. I got a lot of books in here,&#x201d; I said, letting him in first.<br><br>&#x201c;You do?&#x201d; Garth asked me. Because I didn&#x2019;t.<br><br>It was empty. I should have been greeted with the hundreds of colored spines of literary loves, but there was nothing. My books were gone. My office had been cleared out. Everything was gone: my pictures, my lamp, my Persian rug, everything not school property or nailed down, gone. A chasm of vacant whitewashed bookshelves opened up before me.<br><br>I was breathless. Garth was out of breath, but for him, it was just all the stairs.<br><br>&#x201c;They took my shit, man. They took my shit,&#x201d; I kept repeating. I walked over to the desk and pulled out all the drawers. There were some chewed yellow pencils left, and a few folded Post-its and bent paper clips, but that&#x2019;s not what I was looking for. I kept searching, desperate, sliding pencils and papers around, looking for more.<br><br>&#x201c;Damn, dog. You didn&#x2019;t have no porn in there, did you?&#x201d; Garth already had his Little Debbie out and was chewing on it like it was his reward for making it up three floors of nineteenth-century stairs.<br><br>&#x201c;Just a picture,&#x201d; I told him.<br><br>&#x201c;A picture of what?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Angela,&#x201d; I admitted.<br><br>&#x201c;Worse,&#x201d; Garth said, head wagging.<br><br>I slammed the drawer shut, and it was loud. And I liked that sound, a moment of violence, but this time coming from me. So then I started banging on the empty shelves with my fists, and they vibrated. You could hear the echo in the room, then bouncing off into the empty building beyond us until Garth closed the door.<br><br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s wrong, man. Disrespectful. Forget them, job&#x2019;s over. That&#x2019;s life, what you going to do?&#x201d;<br><br>I was going to show up at the president&#x2019;s house and kick his ass, it occurred to me. This act suddenly seemed like the only thing worth running away to Detroit for. I didn&#x2019;t tell Garth this, because he would have stopped me. He was big enough to fill up the door. He was even bigger since he&#x2019;d been laid off. I remembered when this man was skinny, ran track. Ran it poorly, but still. It was depressing looking at every extra pound on him, each a reminder that we were both moving swiftly into decline with little else as accomplishment.<br><br>&#x201c;Wait in the car, man. I just have to check my mail,&#x201d; I told him. Garth did it. I&#x2019;m a bad liar, but he was tired and it was really cold outside, and brothers don&#x2019;t like the cold.* It was late spring, but it had been raining for a week and upstate New York was frigid in a way which was more gothic and empiric than the Philly chill we&#x2019;d grown up with.<br><br>#&#x201c;You drunk. I&#x2019;m tired as all hell. The sooner you get your ass out of here, the sooner you get to get your ass out of here,&#x201d; Garth offered, but he left. So then I walked over to the president&#x2019;s house to punch him and maybe kick him a few times too.<br><br>In my head, I was getting &#x201c;gangsta,&#x201d; which I&#x2019;ve always felt showed greater intent than getting &#x201c;gangster&#x201d; in that it expresses a willful unlawfulness even upon its own linguistic representation. I was going to show him how we do where I&#x2019;m from, go straight Philly on him, and I knew all about that because, although I had never actually punched someone in the face before, as a child I myself had been on the receiving end of that act several times and was a quick study.<br><br>The president&#x2019;s house was at the other end of the campus, but it was a small liberal arts campus. An empty space, dorms and buildings deserted, solar streetlamps popping on and off for just me. While I was walking, stoking my anger, thinking of all the work I&#x2019;d done and all that security I was now being denied, I came <br><br>* Matthew Henson excluded.<br><br>to the administration building, and I saw that there was a light on. Downstairs, in the back, in the president&#x2019;s office. No one just left interior lights on, the environmental footprint too massive, the cost too high, and with every attack the prices went even higher. So he was in there. The outside door opened, and I knew he was in there.<br><br>And then there was this overwhelming emotion. It was not rage or anger. It was something even more illicit, unwanted. It was hope. Here we were, two men alone. Society vacated, and now just two men and a problem, one that somehow in my stupor seemed workable. There was a guy down the hall, a Romanticist, who had been denied tenure ten years ago. Approved by the faculty committee, just as I was, only to be shot down by the same president in the same manner. And he had, in his grief, approached the all-powerful boss man, and he had repented all of his sins, real and imagined, and was granted a permanent teaching gig. It made sense too, for as Frederick Douglass&#x2019;s narrative tells us, it is more valuable to a master to have a morally broken slave than to have a confident one. That Romanticist&#x2019;s story had always seemed humiliating to me before this moment, but suddenly it became inspirational. At the president&#x2019;s door, I paused, prepared myself for what could be simply the final test before I overcame my troubles. I took a deep breath to prepare for a performance of dignified groveling. Then I heard the music coming from inside.<br><br>What I saw scared me. Took me out of my confidence, my momentum. What do you make of a Jew sitting in the dark listening to Wagner in this day and age? I could think of no more call to the end of the world than the one I was looking at. Random violence on the news had become background noise to me at that point, but this scene genuinely scared my ass. Still in his bow tie and tweed jacket at this time of night, it was disgusting. He hit his keyboard quickly, and suddenly the sound became Mahler, but I knew, I knew what I&#x2019;d heard. As the sound cleansed the room, the bald man just looked at me, drink in hand. As drunk as I was, I could still smell the sweet singe of alcohol hanging in the air.<br><br>&#x201c;My shit!&#x201d; it came out. It lacked the eloquence of a planned rebuttal, but he understood.<br><br>&#x201c;Packed by movers, delivered to your listed residence. A thank-you, really, for your service. Thank you.&#x201d; He said the last bit as if I should be saying this to him, but still it robbed me of a bit of my momentum. I had been surviving on righteous indignation and self-pity for weeks, I realized once the supply seemed threatened. But then I remembered I&#x2019;d been canned and my fuel line kicked in once more.</p><h2>Emanuel CrunchTime for Evidence</h2><p><p>When it s exam time you need the right information in the right format to study efficiently and effectively. <strong>Emanuelï¿½&nbsp;CrunchTime</strong> is the perfect tool for exam studying.

Airline food. Boneless ribs. Fuzzy logic. Some words just don&#x2019;t seem to belong together. I&#x2019;m betting you&#x2019;d say <i>healthy brownie</i> falls into that category. Au contraire! How do I know that isn&#x2019;t the case? Because there was a lot of &#x201c;yumming&#x201d; in my kitchen as a gaggle of brownie aficionados devoured these. Refined white sugar out; Grade B maple syrup in. See ya white flour; hello almond flour and brown rice flour. Fare-thee-well butter; come-on-down olive oil! Add dark chocolate, walnuts, and cinnamon, and the result is a decadent culinary oxymoron for the ages.</p> <p><em>Makes 16 brownies</em></p> <p><em>Prep Time: 20 minutes </em></p> <p><em>Cook Time: 30 minutes</em></p> <p><b>Ingredients</b></p> <ul> <li>1/3 cup almond flour, homemade (page 226) or store-bought</li> <li>1/3 cup brown rice flour</li> <li>2 tablespoons natural unsweetened cocoa powder</li> <li>1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li> <li>1/2 teaspoon baking soda</li> <li>1/8 teaspoon sea salt</li> <li>8 ounces dark chocolate (68 to 72% cacao content), chopped</li> <li>1/3 cup extra-virgin olive oil</li> <li>2 organic eggs</li> <li>1/3 cup Grade B maple syrup</li> <li>1/3 cup maple sugar</li> <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li> <li>1/2 cup coarsely chopped walnuts (optional), toasted</li> </ul> <p><b>Cook&#x2019;s Note</b></p> <p>You can also use a 9 by 6-inch baking pan. If you do, the baking time will be only about 25 minutes.</p> <p><b>Who Knew?</b></p> <p>Cacao content is the amount of pure cacao products (chocolate liquor, cocoa butter, and cocoa powder) used in the chocolate; the higher the percentage, the more antioxidants the chocolate contains. And if you&#x2019;re into addition by subtraction, higher cacao percentages mean lower sugar content.</p> <p><b>Directions</b></p> <p>Preheat the oven to 350ï¿½F. Line an 8-inch square baking pan (see note) with two pieces of foil long enough to overlap on all four sides. Lightly oil the foil.</p> <p>Put the almond flour, brown rice flour, cocoa powder, cinnamon, baking soda, and salt in a bowl and stir with a whisk to combine.</p> <p>Put half of the chocolate in a heatproof bowl and set the bowl over a saucepan of simmering water.

That&#x2019;s where my buddy Chris, from Zuckerman&#x2019;s Farm, used to sit me down and teach me about all things asparagus. Chris worked hard--awfully hard--as a farmer. He was true salt of the earth, and as generous as they come. Normally, there&#x2019;s an invisible line: farmers behind their wares and buyers on the other side, but Chris always insisted I &#x201c;step into his parlor.&#x201d; Both of us were always so excited when the first asparagus of the season showed up. He&#x2019;d put aside a bunch for me, and then we&#x2019;d both hop up on that tailgate and talk&#x2014;about recipes, how amazingly nutritious asparagus is, and, a lot of the time, about life and family.</p> <p>Chris passed away not long ago, and I felt the best way I could honor him was to create a recipe featuring his favorite veggie. I think he would have enjoyed this, and I hope you will too.</p> <p><em>Makes 4 servings</em></p> <p><em>Prep Time: 15 minutes</em></p> <p><em>Cook Time: 10 minutes</em></p> <p><b>Ingredients</b></p> <ul> <li>1/3 cup hazelnuts</li> <li>2 bunches asparagus (about 2 pounds), tough ends snapped off and discarded, then peeled (see note)</li> <li>2 tablespoons plus 2 teaspoons extra-virgin olive oil</li> <li>Sea salt</li> <li>2 tablespoons freshly squeezed lemon juice</li> <li>Freshly ground pepper</li> <li>4 cups loosely packed arugula</li> </ul> <p><b>Cook&#x2019;s Note</b></p> <p>Peeling the asparagus gets rid of the stringy, sometimes tough outer layer and exposes the sweet flesh underneath. To peel it, use a regular vegetable peeler with a light touch to shave off just the skin. This technique is not necessary with thin asparagus spears.</p> <p><b>Directions</b></p> <p>Preheat the oven to 400ï¿½F.</p> <p>Put the hazelnuts on a rimmed baking sheet. Put them in the oven for 5 to 7 minutes as it preheats, until aromatic and browned. Transfer to a plate or, if you&#x2019;d like to remove the skins for a more refined texture and appearance, wrap them in a towel and give them a good rub. The majority of the skins will come right off. Coarsely chop the hazelnuts.</p> <p>Put the asparagus on the same baking sheet in a single layer. Drizzle with the 2 teaspoons of olive oil and generously sprinkle with salt. Toss gently to evenly coat the asparagus. Bake for 8 minutes, until just barely tender.</p> <p>Put the lemon juice, the 2 tablespoons of olive oil, 1/4 teaspoon of salt, and a few grinds of pepper in a small bowl and mix well with a small whisk.</p> <p>ut the arugula in a large bowl. Drizzle with half of the dressing and toss until evenly coated. Mound the arugula on individual plates or a platter and arrange the asparagus on top. Drizzle with the remaining dressing and sprinkle the hazelnuts on top.</p> <p><i>Variation:</i> Substitute toasted pistachios or walnuts for the hazelnuts.</p><p>REBECCA KATZ, MS, is an accomplished chef and national speaker who has worked with the country&#x2019;s top wellness physicians, including Andrew Weil, Deepak Chopra, Michael Lerner, Jim Gordon, and Dean Ornish.

Griffin&#39;s epic novel of World War II--a powerful, dramatic tribute to the brave men and women who lived it...The captain who led his squadron in to the fiercest air battles of the Pacific. The correspondent who learned more about combat than he bargained for. The Marine who embarked on a top secret mission from which there was no certain return...</p><p><b>W. E. B. Griffin</b>&nbsp;is the author of seven bestselling series: The Corps, Brotherhood of War, Badge of Honor, Men at War, Honor Bound, Presidential Agent, and now Clandestine Operations. He lives in Fairhope, Alabama, and Buenos Aires, Argentina.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;Set in 1942, the sixth book (following Line of Fire ) in Griffin's series about The Corps revolves around a war bond tour featuring Marine heroes of the Guadalcanal campaign. Series fans will recognize the central characters, among them Marine general and presidential troubleshooter Fleming Pickering, his fighter pilot son Pick, and movie mogul Homer Dillon, a Marine for the duration. Griffin has Marine Corps lore and trivia down pat, and he uses the bond-tour story line to convey the public-relations aspects of modern war. Essentially, however, the novel succeeds because the alcoholic and amorous exploits of its stateside heroes could be mink-lined wish fulfillment for the fantasies of the average soldier--most of the "close combat" here takes place in various bedrooms. <br>Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>American Scripture: Making the Declaration of Independence</h2><p>Pauline Maier shows us the Declaration as both the defining statement of our national identity and the moral standard by which we live as a nation. It is truly "American Scripture," and Maier tells us how it came to be -- from the Declaration's birth in the hard and tortuous struggle by which Americans arrived at Independence to the ways in which, in the nineteenth century, the document itself became sanctified.<br><br>Maier describes the transformation of the Second Continental Congress into a national government, unlike anything that preceded or followed it, and with more authority than the colonists would ever have conceded to the British Parliament; the great difficulty in making the decision for Independence; the influence of Paine's <i>Common Sense</i>, which shifted the terms of debate; and the political maneuvers that allowed Congress to make the momentous decision.<br><br>In Maier's hands, the Declaration of Independence is brought close to us. She lets us hear the voice of the people as revealed in the other "declarations" of 1776: the local resolutions -- most of which have gone unnoticed over the past two centuries -- that explained, advocated, and justified Independence and undergirded Congress's work. Detective-like, she discloses the origins of key ideas and phrases in the Declaration and unravels the complex story of its drafting and of the group-editing job which angered Thomas Jefferson.<br><br>Maier also reveals what happened to the Declaration after the signing and celebration: how it was largely forgotten and then revived to buttress political arguments of the nineteenth century; and, most important, how Abraham Lincoln ensured its persistence as a living force in American society. Finally, she shows how by the very act of venerating the Declaration as we do -- by holding it as sacrosanct, akin to holy writ -- we may actually be betraying its purpose and its power.</p><p>This is a well-written, well-researched, entertaining account of the creation of the United States' Declaration of Independence as well as an analysis of how the declaration has been enshrined as something of a sacred document (a place it did not always hold). Pauline Maier, a history professor at MIT, will no doubt surprise many readers with detective work demonstrating that Jefferson's Declaration of Independence was actually preceded by many local declarations, which have been generally overlooked by historians but which were published throughout the colonies and were well known in their day. <i>American Scripture</i> holds many surprises as it details Jefferson's drafting of the document, the editing process, and the varying regard with which the Declaration of Independence has been held in the past two centuries."Splendid. Maier skillfully traces the progress of the Declaration from political event to sacred text."--Washington Post<br>"Sharp and engaging...A meticulous exhumation of American history that is full of fascinating details and scintillating insights."--San Francisco Chronicle<br>"Gary Wills, stand aside. Pauline Maier has given us the freshest, best-informed historian's reading of the Declaration of Independence and its context that we have ever had. American Scripture enables us to see just how this sacred text was created, and the ways in which it was unique. It is a remarkable achievement!" <br>-- Richard D. Brown, University of Connecticut<br>"Pauline Maier renders unto Jefferson that which is Jefferson's, but she tells a much larger story. She shows what made the Declaration possible and necessary, considers its lineage, probes its genesis in a time of extreme turmoil, and reflects on its continuing living meaning, achieving all of this in very elegant prose."<br>-- Edward Countryman, Southern Methodist University<br>"Quite simply the fairest, fullest, and finest account ever written of how the Declaration of Independence happened."<br>-- Joseph J. Ellis, Mount Holyoke College<br>"Until I read Pauline Maier's remarkable new book, I thought I knew all I needed to know about the Declaration of Independence. But her deft, lively analysis punctures the received mythology and gives us an entirely original interpretation of our founding document."<br>-- J.

President Truman decided to recover the gold but to keep its riches secret. These, combined with Japanese treasure recovered during the US occupation, and with recovered Nazi loot, would create a worldwide American political action fund to fight communism. This &#x2018;Black Gold&#x2019; gave Washington virtually limitless, unaccountable funds, providing an asset base to reinforce the treasuries of America&#x2019;s allies, to bribe political and military leaders, and to manipulate elections in foreign countries for more than fifty years.</p><p><b>Peggy Seagrave </b>was the senior researcher and picture editor at Time-Life Books. Along with Sterling Seagrave, she is a co-author of the bestselling <i>Lords of the Rim</i> and <i>The Yamato Dynasty</i>.<br><br><b>Sterling Seagrave</b> was a reporter for the <i>Washington Post</i> before becoming a freelance investigative journalist contributing to T<i>ime, Life, Atlantic Monthly,</i> and the <i>Far Eastern Economic Review. </i>He is the author of <i>The Soong Dynasty </i>as well as other books, and with Peggy Seagrave he co-authored the bestselling <i>Lords of the Rim</i> and <i>The Yamato Dynasty</i>.The Seagraves, bestselling authors (Lords of the Rim, etc.), contend that Japan systematically looted the entire continent of Asia during WWII, seizing billions in precious metals, gems and artworks. Further, according to the authors, from war's end to the present, the looted treasure, used by President Truman to create a secret slush fund to fight communism, has had a malignant effect on American and Asian politics. The Seagraves assert that the Japanese imperial family, along with Ferdinand Marcos, every American president from Harry Truman to George W. Bush, and numerous sinister figures on the American hard right have been tainted and in many cases utterly corrupted by the loot. Postwar efforts to recover and exploit the treasure, according to the Seagraves, involved murders, dishonest deals and cover-ups. Readers who want to examine the full range of sources for this controversial account are referred in the book to the authors' Web site, where two CDs containing "more than 900 megabytes" of supporting documentation are available. But a paradox affecting conspiracy histories such as this one is the authors' frequent insistence that the malefactors have suppressed relevant evidence. Conceptual difficulties of this sort make it impossible for the lay reader to judge this book's credibility, even while one is swept up in the high-intensity story the Seagraves tell. FYI: The authors claim that in consequence of their revealing the existence of the slush fund and its resulting "global network of corruption," they have received "veiled death threats."<br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Hills Have Spies (Valdemar: Family Spies)</h2><p><b>In this new series, set in the bestselling world of Valdemar, Heralds Mags and Amily must continue to protect the realm of Valdemar while raising their children and preparing them to follow in their footsteps.</b><br><br>Mags, Herald Spy of Valdemar, and his wife, Amily, the King&#x2019;s Own Herald, are happily married with three kids.

She is also a professional lyricist and a licensed wild bird rehabilitator.<b>Chapter 1</b><br><br><i>Wham!</i><br><br>Perry&#x2019;s captor slammed the door behind him, and the entire building quivered for several long moments with the force of the door crashing into place. Of course, Perry couldn&#x2019;t actually <i>see</i> this; he had a bag over his head. He hadn&#x2019;t expected the noise, and it made him jump and his heart pound frantically.<br><br>It wasn&#x2019;t a very well-maintained or constructed building, given how much it shook, and Perry coughed a little as debris sifted down onto him from what was probably the disintegrating&#x2014;or at least old&#x2014;thatch roof above him. Fortunately, the bag over his head protected him from most of it. <i>Calm down</i>, he told his heart, sternly. He wasn&#x2019;t going to be able to think with his heart pounding like a horse at the gallop . . .<br><br>He shut his eyes to clear his mind of distractions and concentrated on his surroundings.<br><br>He knew the roof was thatch despite the bag, because he heard and sensed mice and sparrows up there and got brief glimpses through their eyes, though he hadn&#x2019;t yet put his mind to contacting them directly. And there were a couple pigeons as well, but they were on the rooftree, rather than in the thatch or on the rafters. While he slowly counted to a hundred, to make sure the man who had captured him was not coming back soon, he eased his way into one tiny mind after another, getting acquainted with them, getting them used to his presence in their heads.<br><br>He didn&#x2019;t bother with the pigeons for now. Anything on the outside of the building wasn&#x2019;t much use to him at the moment.<br><br>One by one, he coaxed the mice out of the thatch and had them line up on the central rafter, where the sparrows already were. He soon figured out that the mice were too nearsighted to do him much good, but the sparrows&#x2019; sharper vision gave him a clear view of the room where he was being held.<br><br>There he was, flour sack over his head, sitting on a simple wooden chair in the middle of an otherwise barren room with a rough plank floor. He&#x2019;d been trussed up expertly, feet tied to the chair legs, hands tied behind the chair back. The chair was a pretty stout one: solid seat and back, thick legs. Heavy, or at least it looked like it. That was very smart of his captors; if they&#x2019;d just left him tied up on the floor, he&#x2019;d have been out of his bonds within a candlemark. The chair made things much more difficult. If he tried to tip it over backward, he&#x2019;d probably break his wrists or hands, and if he tried to tip it over sideways, he&#x2019;d surely break his wrist or forearm.<br><br>A very careful survey, as the sparrows peered around at his request, told him there was nothing in the otherwise bare room for him to use in any way.<br><br>Or so his captor probably thought.<br><br>The walls were also rough planks, but since there wasn&#x2019;t any light coming through the cracks between the planks, they might be cob or plaster outside, or both. The windows were shuttered, and the shutters were barred in place on the inside, light leaking into the room from cracks between the boards of the shutters. <i>Huh.</i> This place looked stouter than he&#x2019;d thought. Maybe the reason it had shaken when the door slammed was because of the strength of his kidnapper, not because the building was in bad repair.<br><br>There were two windows in the right-hand wall, two in the left, and a door at either end of the room. The one behind him was nailed shut with rough boards. The one in front of him was the one his captor had left by.<br><br><i>So, this is probably a one-room house with only one floor, unless that door leads to a staircase. It can&#x2019;t be inside the Old Wall of Haven or the roof would be shingle or tile, not thatch. And he didn&#x2019;t carry me far enough for this to be completely outside Haven.</i><br><br>Now Perry transferred his attention to the pigeons strutting up and down the roof outside. There was an advantage to using such stupid birds; they scarcely noticed he was in their heads, and it was easy to get them to do what he wanted. And what he wanted right now was a view of the entire building and the neighborhood it was in.<br><br>The first time he had entered the mind of a bird and made it fly, he&#x2019;d thrown up afterward. It had been worse than when he&#x2019;d taken that dare to spin around while Trey counted to five hundred. Now, though, he was used to it; his gut was finally convinced that it wasn&#x2019;t <i>his </i>body jerking up and down and making those crazy gyrations. The pigeon he picked was perfectly happy to launch itself into the air and sail in a circle around the building while he looked things over.<br><br>It took him a while to identify the neighborhood; it was outside the old wall, but the building he was in was a very small one and quite old; it probably had been a storage building or a laborer&#x2019;s cottage for a big farm back when this had been farmland. Cob walls much the worse for years but still weatherproof, shutters closed and barred from the inside, and a very thick thatch roof gray with age and green with moss; it was unusual only in that it was built on a slightly raised wooden platform so that you had to go up three rickety steps to the door. The street began practically at the bottom step, and it was closely surrounded by other one- and two-room buildings in a similar state of repair. They were all weatherproof and sound, but not one single thing had been done to them to take them beyond that point. It was as if a single landlord owned everything on this street and adhered to the absolute letter of a contract requiring his cottages to be &#x201c;stout and livable.&#x201d;<br><br>The street seemed oddly deserted . . .<br><br>And then the pigeon turned its head and looked beyond the immediate street, and Perry knew exactly where he was and why it looked deserted. Everyone here was at work in the bigger building, three floors tall, that squatted two streets over, like an enormous sow among her piglets. This was the neighborhood of the Bannerites.<br><br>The Bannerites were an odd but harmless sect comprised entirely of bachelors&#x2014;unmarried men and widowers disinclined to wed again. The Bannerites gave men a trade, a place to live in one of the tiny houses surrounding their central building, and enough wages to keep them decently clothed and fed. In return, they made a heavy twilled sailcloth that was highly prized for its strength and durability; as well as sails, virtually any sort of clothing that needed to take rough wear could be made from it. Raw flax came in at one end of that building, and finished sailcloth exited out of the other. Everything that needed to be done to turn fiber into cloth was done within those four walls, from the retting of the flax, to the spinning of the fiber, to the weaving and finishing of the cloth, the finish depending on who ordered it. Three times a day all work stopped so that the men could pray to the &#x201c;Banner Bearer,&#x201d; though that was the only information anyone outside the group had about the being they worshiped. Every eight days, the Bannerites took half a day off for worship and instruction in the faith, and there were evening instruction and prayer sessions for those who wanted more. Work began at first light and ended at sunset, so the workdays were shorter in winter than in summer. If this was an untenanted Bannerite cottage&#x2014;and it probably was&#x2014;he could make all the noise he wanted to and no one would hear him until the sun went down. And by then&#x2014;&nbsp;<br><br>It wouldn&#x2019;t matter. <i>By then I won&#x2019;t be here.</i><br><br>He let go of the pigeon&#x2019;s mind and turned his attention back to the mice. This was going to be tricky. He was going to have to convince them that <i>he</i> was no threat and that the rope around his wrists was edible. It was a logical solution to getting free; mice could gnaw their way through rope in almost no time. <i>Come on down, my little friends</i>, he coaxed&#x2014;but with feelings, not with words.<br><br>But no matter how hard he tried, he could not persuade them to come down out of the thatch. Evidently the Bannerites were pretty vigilant about chasing them off, and he couldn&#x2019;t overcome their fear of human beings. Every time he got one to creep as far on the rafters as the wall with the door in it, the others panicked and scuttled back up into the thatch, and the one he had been coaxing panicked with them and retreated.<br><br><i>Dammit.</i><br><br>There weren&#x2019;t any rats close by either, not even in the crawlspace under the building. A sharp, curious mind brushing briefly against his told him why. A cat.<br><br>And as he cast his mind farther afield, he sensed more and more cats, all of them sleek, semi-feral, but not starving. Clearly the Bannerites encouraged cats in the same way that farmers did, and for the same reasons. Which made sense&#x2014;a little food and shelter bought you a great deal of pest control.<br><br><i>Well . . . all right.</i> He brought his focus back into the building and hunted for one of the sparrows, eventually choosing a saucy little male. <i>He</i> wasn&#x2019;t afraid of humans; probably the Bannerites put up with their occasional droppings because they hunted insects in the thatch and the buildings while the tenants were away. Perry had no trouble encouraging the little fellow to fly down and perch on his bound hands.<br><br>He couldn&#x2019;t actually take over the bird&#x2019;s body. All he <i>could </i>do was show it what he wanted it to do and encourage it to do so. That little beak wasn&#x2019;t as sharp as mouse teeth, but it might be able to saw through the rope fibers, if he could get the bird to peck at the same place over and over.<br><br>He concentrated so hard on his task that sweat ran down his face inside the bag, his jaw muscles clenched until they ached, and then&#x2014;&nbsp;<br><br><i>Peck. </i>Tentative at first. Then <i>peck</i>, a little harder.<br><br>Wordlessly he flooded it with encouragement, and the bird exploded with energy, pecking and pulling at the fibers of the knot, scissoring its way through the first strand, then the second. The little fellow didn&#x2019;t need any guidance at all now, and he could not have been more enthusiastic.<br><br>Even better, as soon as his fellows noticed him working away at the rope, after some puzzlement, they decided this was something that needed doing, so with some dim idea that they were going to get a reward out of it, three more crowded onto his wrists and hands to peck away alongside the first one.<br><br>Now he had another problem entirely. They didn&#x2019;t always hit the rope, and those sharp little biting stabs <i>hurt</i>. He had to bite his lip to keep from wincing and crying out and frightening them up into the rafters again.<br><br>He kept up the tension on the rope by pulling his wrists apart, or rather trying to, and after what was probably a candlemark or two, but felt like a lot longer, he sensed the rope giving.<br><br>And when it finally parted and his hands came free, sparrows fluttering off to the ceiling, he nearly shouted for joy.<br><br>His first action was to pull the bag off his head, and the dust-laden air smelled impossibly sweet. His second was to untie his legs; he ignored the twinges and cramps as he was finally able to move. His wrists were raw from the rope, speckled with blood from dozens of badly aimed pecks, but it didn&#x2019;t matter. He was free! And he was going to get out of there!<br><br>But before he did, there was one more thing he needed to do.<br><br>He unraveled the rope that had been around his wrists into hundreds of fiber bits and left them in a pile on the floor by the chair. <i>That </i>was what the sparrows had been after: good strong bits of material for their nests. The sparrows descended on the pile as if it had been grain and carried strands up to the thatch to add to their nests.<br><br>They deserved their reward.<br><br>And he couldn&#x2019;t wait to get out of there.<br><br><i>Up or down?</i> He looked up at the exposed thatch of the roof and saw what he had been hoping for: a trap door set into the roof to make it easy to get up there to repair the thatch.<br><br><i>Up.<br><br></i><br>* * * * *<br>Mags glanced at the time-candle as the light from his window was interrupted by something perching on the sill. He raised one eyebrow, smiled slightly, and turned to greet his eldest son.<br><br>&#x201c;I expected you to take at least a candlemark longer,&#x201d; he said, offering Perry a hand inside and noting the abrasions and tiny marks on the lad&#x2019;s wrist. &#x201c;Mice?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Sparrows,&#x201d; said Perry, with a grin that also betrayed a touch of pain. &#x201c;The mice were too scared.&#x201d; Mags fished some soft bandages and a pot of ointment out of his desk and passed them wordlessly over; the boy deftly soothed and bandaged his wrists himself and handed the pot back.<br><br>As he wrapped his wrists, Mags regarded his son thoughtfully. Peregrine would be thirteen in two weeks, and he looked like a larger, better-nourished version of his father at that age, at least, as far as Mags could determine. He hadn&#x2019;t looked at himself in the mirror that often back then, but Perry looked like what he remembered: dark hair that never stayed tidy, dark eyes with more than a hint of mischief in them, narrow face, and wiry body. &#x201c;I think we can call the exercise a complete success,&#x201d; he said, allowing his pride in his son to show in his words. &#x201c;What did you do to the men I had watching for your escape?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Left &#x2019;em trying to catch me. I made a pass up in the attic of the Bannerite workhouse; they didn&#x2019;t dare follow me in, and I left in a shipment of sailcloth.&#x201d; Perry grinned, very proud of himself. &#x201c;If I hadn&#x2019;t been able to do that, I figured to drop down among the boys hauling the flax around and leave at sunset.&#x201d;<br><br>Mags grinned and reached out to hug his son. &#x201c;Good lad. Your mama was going to hold dinner for you, but now she won&#x2019;t have to. Go tell her yourself.&#x201d;<br><br>With a whoop of joy, Perry dashed across Mags&#x2019; workroom and out the door into the large central room of the suite.</p><h2>Private: #1 Suspect (Private, 2)</h2><p><b>Former Marine Jack Morgan always uncovers the truth.

Mounce was widely praised as a standard commentary on the Apocalypse. In this new edition, now based on the text of the NIV and Nestle-Aland, Mounce has revised and expanded his work to reflect more than twenty additional years of mature thought on Revelation and to bring his work up to date with the latest scholarship. As in the original edition, Mounce here engages seriously with the various approaches to interpretation and with the conventions common to apocalyptic literature. In affirming more directly his own reading of the Apocalypse, Mounce steers a middle course between an extreme literalism and a highly imaginative subjectivism, believing this to be the way the ancient text spoke to the first-century churches to whom it was addressed - and the way it still speaks to us today.Robert H. Mounce is president emeritus of Whitworth College, Spokane, Washington, and a noted New Testament Greek scholar.

Instead, she has fallen in love with and is about to be married to Meade Wyler, a white jazz musician from New York. A shock wave breaks over the Oval as its longtime members grapple with the changing face of its community.</p><p>With elegant, luminous prose, Dorothy West crowns her literary career by illustrating one family's struggle to break the shackles of race and class.</p></p><p><i>The Wedding</i>, Dorothy West's first novel in almost 50 years, is ably brought to life in this finely nuanced audio version. Writer and actress Regina Taylor (<i>Courage Under Fire</i>, <i>Lean on Me</i>, and TV's <i>I'll Fly Away</i>) uses her considerable talent to show off West's sensual and elegant prose to full advantage. The Oval, an elite African American community in 1950s Martha's Vineyard, sets the stage for the story of the impending nuptials of Shelby Coles, the golden-haired, fair-skinned youngest daughter of the neighborhood's leading family. Shelby's intended groom is Meade Tyler, a white jazz man with a far less upscale pedigree than his bride. (Like many grooms, Meade plays little role in the pre-wedding drama; the snippets of jazz that frame the reading are about as close as listeners get to meeting him.) Sparks fly in the few dozen hours before the wedding, when one by one those close to Shelby come to her to make a case for or against the controversial match. As new characters are introduced, Taylor succeeds in giving each a distinct personality through her reading. <p> Shelby is dragged through a crisis of identity, while West skillfully steers listeners through an examination of the tangled and painful meanings of race and class in the United States, themes that still resonate today. Taylor's reading deftly renders the subtle distinctions between the characters and their backgrounds without ever descending into stereotype. (Running time: about 180 minutes, two cassettes) <i>--Naomi J. Cohn</i></p>On the island of Martha's Vineyard in the 1950s there exists a proud, insular, nearly unassailable community known as the Oval, made up of the best and brightest of New York's and Boston's black bourgeoisie. Dr. Clark Coles and his wife Corinne, pillars of this community, are mortified that their youngest daughter Shelby is set on marrying Meade Wyler, a white jazz musician from New York. Equally alarmed is Lute McNeil, a successful black furniture maker from Boston who is new to Oak Bluffs and desperate for social acceptance. Lute has fallen in love with Shelby Coles, or at least the way of life she represents, and he will stop at nothing to pull her away from Meade. As the day of the wedding approaches, the tension surrounding Shelby, Lute, and Meade builds, climaxing in a single tragic act that will forever change the lives of three American families. <i>The Wedding</i> is a wise and heartfelt novel about the shackles of race and class we all wear and the price we pay to break them. It is also an unforgettable history of the rise of the black middle class, written by a woman who lived it. This wise, heartfelt tale marks Dorothy West's first novel in over four decades.</p><h2>Awed to Heaven, Rooted in Earth: Prayers of Walter Brueggemann</h2><p>This thoughtful collection of prayers emerged from Brueggemanns thirty-five years of teaching in seminaries. Full of reflection, faith, and dialogue, they reveal another side of this gifted author from what his many readers are accustomed to. These deeply felt and sparklingly articulated prayers reflect a wide range of life experiences. As readers, we are taken from the depths of pain and loss to the heights of joy and praise. The author takes on life in its fullest as he utters his praise and lament, petition and thanksgiving. Brueggemanns prayers lead us to deeper commitment, deeper faith, and deeper reflection. The volume also includes an index of biblical allusions that will be useful for preachers as well as the general reader looking for the biblical roots of these fears, hopes, struggles, and aspirations.</p><p>Walter Brueggemann is William Marcellus McPheeters Professor of Old Testament at Columbia Theological Seminary, Decatur, Georgia. He is a prolific author, and his award-winning Theology of the Old Testament (Fortress Press, 1997) has quickly become a foundational work in the field. <p>Editor Edward Searcy is pastor of University Hill Congregation in Vancouver, British Columbia.</p>Walter Brueggemann, whose thoughtful and reflective works on the Hebrew Bible have ensured that the term "Old Testament theologian" is not an oxymoron, offers distilled wisdom from his 35 years of teaching in Awed to Heaven, Rooted to Earth. At the seminaries where he has taught, professors traditionally open their classes with prayer-a practice that for some might devolve into a quick nod to convention, but Brueggemann has always presented the opportunity to involve students more intimately in the assigned biblical texts. This marvelous little book of Brueggemann's start-of-class prayers will have readers cheering, especially when he writes that "much public prayer in the church is careless and slovenly, and... what passes for spontaneity is in fact a lack of preparation." <br>Copyright 2002 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Zen in the Martial Arts</h2><p>"A man who has attained mastery of an art reveals it in his every action."--<i>Samurai Maximum</i>.<br><br>Under the guidance of such celebrated masters as Ed Parker and the immortal Bruce Lee, Joe Hyams vividly recounts his more than 25 years of experience in the martial arts.

It ends in 2008 with Hillary Clinton's historic presidential campaign. This was a time of cataclysmic change, when, after four hundred years, expectations about the lives of American women were smashed in just a generation.<br><br>A comprehensive mix of oral history and Gail Collins's keen research--covering politics, fashion, popular culture, economics, sex, families, and work--<i>When Everything Changed</i> is the definitive book on five crucial decades of progress. The enormous strides made since 1960 include the advent of the birth control pill, the end of "Help Wanted--Male" and "Help Wanted--Female" ads, and the lifting of quotas for women in admission to medical and law schools. Gail Collins describes what has happened in every realm of women's lives, partly through the testimonies of both those who made history and those who simply made their way.<br><br>Picking up where her highly lauded book <i>America's Women</i> left off, <i>When Everything Changed</i> is a dynamic story, told with the down-to-earth, amusing, and agenda-free tone for which this beloved <i>New York Times </i>columnist is known. Older readers, men and women alike, will be startled as they are reminded of what their lives once were--"Father Knows Best" and "My Little Margie" on TV; daily weigh-ins for stewardesses; few female professors; no women in the Boston marathon, in combat zones, or in the police department. Younger readers will see their history in a rich new way. It has been an era packed with drama and dreams--some dashed and others realized beyond anyone's imagining.</p><p>Gail Collins was the Editorial Page Editor for the<i> New York Times </i>from 2001-2007--the first woman to have held that position. She currently writes a column for the <em>Time's</em> Op-Ed page twice weekly."<i>Did feminism fail? </i> Gail Collins's smart, thorough, often droll and extremely readable account of women's recent history in America not only answers this question brilliantly, but also poses new ones about the past and the present."&#x2015;<b>Amy Bloom</b>, <b><i><em>The New York Times Book Review </em></i></b><br><br>"Until now, the second wave women's movement hasn't had its big ambitious history--the equivalent to Taylor Branch's multivolume narrative of the civil rights movement....nothing as sweeping and accessible as this."&#x2015;<b>Margaret Talbot</b>, <b><i><em>Slate.com'</em>s "Double<em> </em>X"</i></b><br><br>"Among the impressive features of Ms. Collins's book is her genial, fair-minded sympathy, her refusal to smirk at the excesses of the most radical '70s feminists or at the stance of women, among them Phyllis Schlafly, who counseled their sisters to stay home where they belonged."&#x2015;<b>Francine Prose</b>, <b><i><em>New York Times</em></i></b><br><br>"What better time to look at American women's progress since the '60s, now that the dust has settled on the 2008 presidential election when so much was won (and lost) by women?...

Schulzï¿½&#x20ac;&#x2122;s cartooning has never been more expressive, and his sense of humor never more unencumbered by formula or tradition.</p><p><p><strong>Charles M. Schulz</strong> was born November 25, 1922, in Minneapolis. His destiny was foreshadowed when an uncle gave him, at the age of two days, the nickname Sparky (after the racehorse Spark Plug in the newspaper strip <em>Barney Google</em>).<br><br> In his senior year in high school, his mother noticed an ad in a local newspaper for a correspondence school, Federal Schools (later called Art Instruction Schools). Schulz passed the talent test, completed the course, and began trying, unsuccessfully, to sell gag cartoons to magazines. (His first published drawing was of his dog, Spike, and appeared in a 1937 <em>Ripley's Believe It or Not!</em> installment.) Between 1948 and 1950, he succeeded in selling 17 cartoons to the <em>Saturday Evening Post</em>&#x2015;as well as, to the local <em>St. Paul Pioneer Press</em>, a weekly comic feature called <em>Li'l Folks</em>. It was run in the women's section and paid $10 a week. After writing and drawing the feature for two years, Schulz asked for a better location in the paper or for daily exposure, as well as a raise. When he was turned down on all three counts, he quit.<br><br> He started submitting strips to the newspaper syndicates. In the spring of 1950, he received a letter from the United Feature Syndicate, announcing their interest in his submission, <em>Li'l Folks</em>. Schulz boarded a train in June for New York City; more interested in doing a strip than a panel, he also brought along the first installments of what would become <em>Peanuts</em>&#x2015;and that was what sold. (The title, which Schulz loathed to his dying day, was imposed by the syndicate.) The first <em>Peanuts</em> daily appeared October 2, 1950; the first Sunday, January 6, 1952.<br><br> Diagnosed with cancer, Schulz retired from <em>Peanuts</em> at the end of 1999. He died on February 13, 2000, the day before Valentine's Day&#x2015;and the day before his last strip was published&#x2015;having completed 17,897 daily and Sunday strips, each and every one fully written, drawn, and lettered entirely by his own hand&#x2015;an unmatched achievement in comics.</p><p><strong>RiffTrax</strong> is the successful comedy trio of Bill Corbett, Kevin Murphy, and Michael J.

Instead of fading, the shimmering charge split in two and the twin streams of plasma began to circle their respective pillars. They moved like flames chasing the wind, racing around the columns and snaking their way upward toward the underside of a curved, metallic dome. There, they swirled together like the arms of a spiral galaxy, joining each other once again before vanishing in a final, eye-searing flash.</p><p>Darkness followed.</p><p>Ozone lingered in the air.</p><p>On the floor of the cavern, a group of men and women stood motionless, night-blind from the display. The flash had been impressive, but they&#x2019;d all seen electricity before. Every one of them expected something more. </p><p>&#x201c;Is that it?&#x201d; a gruff voice asked.</p><p>The words came from Brigadier General Hal Cortland, a burly, squat figure of a man. They were directed at thirty-eight-year-old Daniel Watterson, a slight, blond-haired man wearing spectacles who stood by the controls of the great machine from which the artificial lightning had come.</p><p>Watterson studied a bank of dimly lit gauges. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not actually sure,&#x201d; he whispered to himself. No one had ever gotten this far, not even Michael Faraday or the great Nikola Tesla. But if Watterson was right&#x2014;if his calculations and his theory and years of serving as Tesla&#x2019;s apprentice had led him to understand what was about to occur&#x2014;then the display of light they&#x2019;d just witnessed should be only the beginning.</p><p>He switched off the main power, stepped away from the controls, and pulled the wire-rimmed glasses from his face. Despite the darkness, he could make out a soft blue glow coming from the columns. He raised his eyes to the dome above. An effervescent hue could be seen coursing around its inner surface.</p><p>&#x201c;Well?&#x201d; Cortland demanded.</p><p>Back at the console, one of the needles ticked up. Watterson saw it from the corner of his eye.</p><p>&#x201c;No, General,&#x201d; he said quietly, &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think it&#x2019;s quite finished.&#x201d;</p><p>As Watterson spoke, a low rumble made its way through the cave. It sounded like heavy stones tumbling in some distant quarry, muffled and distorted, as if the vibration had to traverse miles of solid rock just to reach them. It rose for several seconds, then faded and ceased.</p><p>The general began to snicker. He switched on a flashlight. &#x201c;Uncle Sam ain&#x2019;t paying for a show with wet fireworks, son.&#x201d;</p><p>Watterson didn&#x2019;t reply. He was listening, feeling for something, for anything, at this point.</p><p>The general seemed to give up. &#x201c;Come on, people,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;the party&#x2019;s over. Let&#x2019;s get out of this mole hole.&#x201d;</p><p>The group began to move. Their shuffling and mumbling made it impossible to hear.</p><p>Watterson raised a hand. &#x201c;Please!&#x201d; he called out loudly. &#x201c;Everyone, stay where you are!&#x201d;</p><p>The observers stopped in their tracks, and Watterson edged over to where the steel columns penetrated the rock floor. From there, they descended another five hundred feet &#x201c;to get a firm<i> </i>grip on the Earth,&#x201d; as Tesla once put it.</p><p>Laying a hand on one of the columns, Watterson felt a cold vibration. It surged through his body as if he&#x2019;d become a part of the circuit. It wasn&#x2019;t painful like electricity and didn&#x2019;t make his muscles spasm, nor did it find its way to the ground and electrocute him. It was almost soothing, leaving him slightly dizzy, even a bit euphoric.</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s coming,&#x201d; he whispered.</p><p>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s coming?&#x201d; the general asked.</p><p>Watterson looked back. &#x201c;The return.&#x201d;</p><p>Cortland waited a few seconds before scowling. &#x201c;You scientists are like barkers at a carnival: you think if you say something loud enough, and often enough, the rest of us will begin to believe it. But I don&#x2019;t hear any&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>The general swallowed his words as the deep rumble made a second appearance. It surged through the cavern more emphatically this time, and the blue glow around the towers intensified, pulsing and matching the sound waves identically.</p><p>This time, when the waves faded, everyone held still. They were waiting for more. Forty seconds later they were rewarded. A third wave came through like a freight train passing by. It shook the cave underfoot and brought the swirl of lightning back to the polished surface of the dome above. The visible spiral of energy began descending the pillars, making it halfway down to the ground before vanishing.</p><p>Watterson pulled back, stepping away from the danger zone.</p><p>Moments later, a fourth reverberation surged into the cavern. The columns flared as it hit. Flashes of light jumped back and forth between them. The cavern began shaking. Dust and tiny bits of stone rained down from above, sending the witnesses scurrying for cover.</p><p>Watterson caught sight of General Cortland bathed in the light and grinning manically. Their roles had reversed. Now it was Cortland looking satisfied as Watterson began to worry. The scientist stepped toward the panel, slid his glasses back on, and studied the display. He couldn&#x2019;t account for the vibration.</p><p>Before he could determine anything, a fifth wave hit. The vibration and the artificial lightning grew so intense, even the general seemed to realize something was wrong. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s happening?&#x201d;</p><p>Watterson could barely hear him, but he was wondering the same thing. The power gauges&#x2014;all but dead moments before&#x2014;were heading toward their redlines.</p><p>A brief respite gave way to a sixth harmonic return, and the needles went off the scales. The shuddering was unbearable. Rocks were falling from above. A huge crack began to zigzag its way across the reinforced wall of the cave where the army had poured concrete to shore it up. Watterson had to grip the panel to stop from falling down.</p><p>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s happening?&#x201d; the general repeated. Watterson wasn&#x2019;t sure, but it couldn&#x2019;t be good.</p><p>&#x201c;Get everybody out of here,&#x201d; he yelled. &#x201c;Get them out&#x2014;now!&#x201d;</p><p>The general pointed toward the cagelike elevator that would take them four hundred feet to the surface. The group ran for it like a stampeding herd. But the tremors intensified and the far wall gave way before they could climb inside.</p><p>A thousand tons of rock and concrete plunged down on them. Those too close were crushed instantly. Others scrambled away just in time as the scaffolding-like frame of the elevator was bent and shoved aside.</p><p>Watterson began to panic. His hands flew back and forth across the controls, flicking switches and tapping gauges. The vibration was constant. The sound deafening.</p><p>Cortland grabbed him by the shoulder. &#x201c;Turn it off!&#x201d;</p><p>Watterson ignored him. He was trying to understand.</p><p>&#x201c;Did you hear me?!&#x201d; the general shouted. <i>&#x201c;Turn the damned thing off!&#x201d;</i></p><p>&#x201c;It is off!&#x201d; Watterson shouted, pulling free of the general&#x2019;s grasp.</p><p>&#x201c;What?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s been off since after the first spark,&#x201d; Watterson explained.</p><p>The latest wave faded, but on the panel he could see the next wave building. The needles went off the scale and Watterson&#x2019;s face went white. Each wave had been bigger than the last. He feared to imagine what kind of power was on its way.</p><p>&#x201c;Then where&#x2019;s the energy coming from?&#x201d; Cortland demanded.</p><p>&#x201c;From everywhere,&#x201d; Watterson said. &#x201c;From all around us. That&#x2019;s what the experiment was supposed to prove.&#x201d;</p><p>The cavern began to shake once again. This time the lightning was not contained on the columns, it jumped around the room, flying into the walls, the ceiling, and the floor. Shards of stone and clouds of dust blasted out into the open space.</p><p>Amid the screams and panic, Watterson stood helpless, his moment of victory fading to utter catastrophe. From above him came the ominous sound of cracking. </p><p>With the cave shaking so badly they could barely stand, both Watterson and the general looked up. A dark fissure snaked across the ceiling. It went from wall to wall and then spidered in different directions. </p><p>The ceiling collapsed all at once and a million tons of rock dropped toward them. </p><p>Death came instantly, and neither Watterson nor General Cortland would ever know the fury they&#x2019;d unleashed or the utter devastation that the ensuing earthquake caused in the city of San Francisco.</p><p></p><p></p><p>December 2009</p><p>In the midst of a growing tempest, Patrick Devlin stood on the aft deck of the <i>Java Dawn</i>, an oceangoing tug linked by a single massive cable to the rusting hulk of a cruise ship known as the <i>Pacific Voyager</i>.</p><p>Huge swells came at the tug sideways, slamming against the hull with the sound of a shotgun blast. The rain fell in diagonal sheets, though it was hard to distinguish from the wind-whipped spray.</p><p>Surrounded by towing and loading equipment, including a fifty-foot crane and a powerful winch array, Devlin looked positively small. In truth, he stood nearly six feet tall, with broad shoulders that were hunched against the cold.</p><p>With gray stubble on his cheeks and folds of burnished flesh hooding his eyes, Devlin appeared every bit the wizened old sailor he was. Taking stock of the deteriorating weather, the increasing strain on the cable, and the condition of the sea, he came to a grave conclusion: they&#x2019;d made a ruinous choice to leave port, one they&#x2019;d be lucky to survive.</p><p>As Devlin grabbed the ship&#x2019;s phone, another swell rolled the tug severely. The captain picked up on the other end.</p><p>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s our heading?&#x201d; Devlin yelled into the receiver.</p><p>&#x201c;Due south,&#x201d; the captain said.</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s no good,&#x201d; Devlin replied. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ll never survive this side-on beating. We have to turn into the swells.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;We can&#x2019;t, Padi,&#x201d; the captain insisted. &#x201c;That&#x2019;ll take us into the teeth of the storm.&#x201d;</p><p>Gripping the bulkhead to keep from falling, Devlin watched a wave crash over the deck. &#x201c;This is madness,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;We should&#x2019;ve never left Tarakan.&#x201d;</p><p>Tarakan was the primitive, almost backwater port where they&#x2019;d picked up the <i>Voyager</i>.<i> </i>The old liner had berthed there for repairs some years ago after an accident. She&#x2019;d ended up marooned when her shipping line went bankrupt several days later.</p><p>At some point, the ship was sold to a mystery buyer, but, for reasons unknown, the <i>Voyager</i> sat and rusted at Tarakan for three more years. Issues with the bankruptcy and squabbles about who would pay for the repairs, Devlin guessed.</p><p>Whatever it was, the ship looked like a derelict when they&#x2019;d found her; covered in corrosion from stem to stern, barely seaworthy. The hastily repaired damage from where the freighter had holed her looked like a jagged H near the bow. </p><p>Now, caught up in a storm that was rapidly getting worse, she was certain to go down.</p><p>&#x201c;How&#x2019;s the line?&#x201d; the captain asked.</p><p>Devlin glanced at the thick cable that stretched from the gigantic winch across the aft end of the tug and out toward the <i>Voyager</i>. The cable tensed and strained with the load before going slack again.</p><p>&#x201c;The cable&#x2019;s taut,&#x201d; Devlin said. &#x201c;That rust bucket is starting to pitch with these waves. She&#x2019;s definitely riding lower as well. We need to get the inspection crew back.&#x201d;</p><p>Against Devlin&#x2019;s wishes, the captain had allowed three men to stay aboard the cruise ship to watch for leaks. It was dangerous in these conditions and a waste of time as well. If she was taking on water, there was nothing they could do to stop it. And if she started to go down&#x2014;like Devlin thought she was&#x2014;they would need to cut the cable and let her go before she dragged the <i>Java Dawn </i>into the depths alongside her<i>. </i>But with three men on the ship, cutting that cable would be the closest thing to murder Devlin had ever done.</p><p>The big tug nosed over and dropped into the largest trough yet. As it did, the cable stretched so tight that it actually began to sing. The tension pulled the aft end of the tug backward, the water churning around the hull as the propellers fought against the strain.</p><p>By the time the tug rose up on the next swell, the <i>Voyager </i>must have been dipping into a trough of her own because the tow cable pulled downward, bending over the reinforced-steel plating at the tug&#x2019;s transom and forcing the aft end of the deck into the water.</p><p>Devlin raised binoculars to his eyes. The action of the waves had a way of obscuring the truth, but only to a point. The <i>Voyager </i>was definitely riding lower.</p><p>&#x201c;She&#x2019;s down at the bow, Captain. Listing slightly to port.&#x201d;</p><p>The captain hesitated. Devlin knew why: this tow was worth a small fortune, but not if the ship didn&#x2019;t make it.</p><p>&#x201c;Call them back!&#x201d; Devlin shouted. &#x201c;For God sakes, Captain, at least call the men back.&#x201d;</p><p>Finally, the captain spoke. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ve been calling them, Padi. They&#x2019;re not answering. Something must have gone wrong.&#x201d;</p><p>The words chilled Devlin&#x2019;s core. &#x201c;We have to send a boat out.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;In this? It&#x2019;s too dangerous.&#x201d;</p><p>As if to emphasize the point, another wave hit them broadside and a thousand gallons of water crashed over the rail, flooding the aft deck.</p><p>The sturdy tug quickly shed the water, but moments later another wave swamped it more drastically than the first.</p><p>As the <i>Java Dawn</i> recovered, Devlin looked toward the <i>Voyager</i>.</p><p>She was definitely going down.

But despite his ambivalence about politics, the former federal judge found success in the executive branch as governor of the Philippines and secretary of war, and he won a resounding victory in the presidential election of 1908 as Theodore Roosevelt&#x2019;s handpicked successor.</p><p>In this provocative assessment, Jeffrey Rosen reveals Taft&#x2019;s crucial role in shaping how America balances populism against the rule of law. Taft approached each decision as president by asking whether it comported with the Constitution, seeking to put Roosevelt&#x2019;s activist executive orders on firm legal grounds. But unlike Roosevelt, who thought the president could do anything the Constitution didn&#x2019;t forbid, Taft insisted he could do only what the Constitution explicitly allowed. This led to a dramatic breach with Roosevelt in the historic election of 1912, which Taft viewed as a crusade to defend the Constitution against the demagogic populism of Roosevelt and Woodrow Wilson.</p><p>Nine years later, Taft achieved his lifelong dream when President Warren Harding appointed him chief justice, and during his years on the Court he promoted consensus among the justices and transformed the judiciary into a modern, fully equal branch. Though he had chafed in the White House as a judicial president, he thrived as a presidential chief justice.</p></p><p><b>Jeffrey Rosen</b> is the author of several books, including <i>Louis D.

Please tell me you&#x2019;re here to do&nbsp;something about the dust.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I don&#x2019;t answer. I don&#x2019;t know what to say.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The girl&#x2019;s voice is throaty and ill, her eyes looking out over a&nbsp;nose-and-mouth mask, staring hopeful and crazed at me as I stand&nbsp;baffled on her doorstep. Beautiful blonde, hair swept back out of her&nbsp;face, dirty and exhausted like everybody, panicked like everybody.&nbsp;But there&#x2019;s something else going on here, something not healthy.&nbsp;Something biochemical in her eyes.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Well, come in,&#x201d; she says through her allergy mask. &#x201c;Come on,&nbsp;come in, close the door, the door.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I step inside and she kicks the door shut and whirls around&nbsp;to face me. Yellow sundress, faded and tattered at the hem. Starved-looking,&nbsp;sallow, pale. Wearing not just the allergy mask but thick&nbsp;yellow latex gloves. And she&#x2019;s armed to the teeth is the other thing,&nbsp;she&#x2019;s holding two semiautomatics and has a smaller gun tucked in her&nbsp;boot, plus some kind of heavy-duty hunting knife in a calf sheath at&nbsp;the hem of the sundress. And I can&#x2019;t tell if it&#x2019;s live or not, but there is&nbsp;unquestionably a grenade dangling from a braided belt at her waist.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Do you see the <i>dust</i>?&#x201d; she says, gesturing with the guns,&nbsp;pointing into the corners. &#x201c;You see how we&#x2019;ve got a serious problem&nbsp;with the dust?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It&#x2019;s true that there are motes hovering in the sunbeams, along&nbsp;with the garbage scattered on the floor, heaps of dirty clothing and&nbsp;open trunks spilling over with all manner of useless things, magazines&nbsp;and electrical cords and wadded-up dollar bills. But she&#x2019;s seeing more&nbsp;than what&#x2019;s here, I can tell, she&#x2019;s in the outer reaches, she&#x2019;s blinking&nbsp;furiously, coughing behind her mask.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I wish I could recall this girl&#x2019;s name. That would help a lot, if I&nbsp;could just remember her name.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;What do we do about this?&#x201d; she says, rattling out words. &#x201c;Do&nbsp;you just vacuum it, or&#x2014;? Is that it&#x2014;do you just suck it up and take&nbsp;it out of here? Does that work with cosmic dust?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#x201c;Cosmic dust,&#x201d; I say. &#x201c;Huh. Well, you know, I&#x2019;m not sure.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This is my first trip to Concord, New Hampshire, since I fled&nbsp;a month ago, since my house burned down, along with much of the&nbsp;rest of the city. The chaos of those final frantic hours has died down&nbsp;to a grim and mournful silence. We&#x2019;re a few blocks from downtown,&nbsp;in the abandoned husk of a store on Wilson Street, but there are no&nbsp;jostling anxious crowds outside, no frightened people rushing and&nbsp;pushing past each other in the streets. No klaxon howl of car alarms,&nbsp;no distant gunfire. The people are hidden now, those that remain,&nbsp;hidden under blankets or in basements, encased in their dread.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And the girl, disintegrating, raving about imaginary dust from&nbsp;outer space. We&#x2019;ve met once before, right here at this same small shop,&nbsp;which was once a used-clothing store called Next Time Around. She&nbsp;wasn&#x2019;t like this then, hadn&#x2019;t fallen prey to it. Other people are sick&nbsp;in the same way, of course, to varying degrees, different kinds of&nbsp;symptomatology; if the <i>DSM-IV</i> were still being updated and applied,&nbsp;this new illness would be added in red. A debilitating obsession with&nbsp;the gigantic asteroid on a collision course with our fragile planet.&nbsp;<i>Astromania</i>, perhaps. <i>Delusional interstellar psychosis</i>.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I feel like if I could only call her by her name, remind her that&nbsp;we have a relationship, that we&#x2019;re both human beings, it would ease&nbsp;her unsettled mind and make me less of a threat. Then we could talk&nbsp;calmly.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;It&#x2019;s toxic, you know,&#x201d; she&#x2019;s saying. &#x201c;Really, really bad. The&nbsp;cosmic dust is real, real bad on your lungs. The photons burn your&nbsp;lungs.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Listen,&#x201d; I say, and she makes a panicked gasp and rushes toward&nbsp;me, her assorted armaments jangling.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Keep your<i> tongue </i>in your <i>mouth</i>,&#x201d; she hisses. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t <i>taste</i> it.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Okay.

I won&#x2019;t.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I keep my hands at my sides, where she can see them, keep&nbsp;my expression neutral, soft as cake. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m actually here for some&nbsp;information.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Information?&#x201d; Her brows knit with confusion. She peers at&nbsp;me through clouds of invisible dust.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It&#x2019;s not her I&#x2019;m here to talk to, anyway; it&#x2019;s her friend I need.&nbsp;Boyfriend, maybe. Whatever he is. That&#x2019;s the guy who knows where&nbsp;I need to go next. I hope he does, anyway. I&#x2019;m counting on it.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;I need to speak to Jordan. Is Jordan here?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Suddenly the girl finds focus, snaps to attention, and the pistols&nbsp;come up. &#x201c;Did he&#x2014;did he send you?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;No.&#x201d; I raise my hands. &#x201c;No.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Oh my God, he sent you. Are you with him? Is he in space?&#x201d;&nbsp;She&#x2019;s shouting, advancing across the room, the barrels of the&nbsp;semiautomatics aimed at my face like twin black holes. &#x201c;Is he doing&nbsp;this?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I turn my head to the wall, scared to die, even now, even today.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Is he doing this to me?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And then&#x2014;somehow&#x2014;miraculously&#x2014;the name.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Abigail.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Her eyes soften, widen slightly.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Abigail,&#x201d; I say. &#x201c;Can I help you?

A film noir regular known for his villainous roles in movies like <i>Rear Window</i>, he eventually became one of the most popular stars in television history as the lead actor on two top-rated dramas, <i>Perry Mason</i> and <i>Ironside</i>, which between them ran virtually uninterrupted for 20 years.<br><br>But Raymond Burr was leading a secret gay life at a time in Hollywood when exposure would have been career suicide. To protect his secret, Burr fabricated a tragic past for himself as a grieving husband and father. He claimed to have been twice widowed &#x2013; he said his first wife had died in a plane crash, and his second marriage had ended with his wife's early death from cancer. And there was also a dead son &#x2013; 10-year-old Michael, who lost his battle with leukemia. Neither of the wives nor Michael ever existed. But that didn't stop these lies from being perpetuated again and again, even in Burr's <i>New York Times</i> obituary.<br><br><i>Hiding in Plain Sight</i> examines the totality of Raymond Burr's career and his personal life, including his 35 years with partner Robert Benevides. The author interviewed over 30 people who knew or worked with Burr, including Angela Lansbury, Barbara Hale, Robert Wagner, Gale Storm, and more.</p><p><b>Michael Seth Starr</b> (River Vale, NJ) has covered television at the <i>New York Post</i> for thirteen years. He has written biographies of Peter Sellers, Art Carney, Joey Bishop, and Bobby Darin, and has appeared on <i>The Today Show</i>, <i>The Early Show</i>, <i>Good Morning America</i>, <i>The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson</i>, <i>Entertainment Tonight</i>, and <i>Access Hollywood</i>.Starr's lackluster biography doesn't do justice to the complex man who transformed himself from B-movie thug to television's beloved attorney, Perry Mason. Born in British Columbia in 1917, Burr moved to California as a child, where he took his first stab at acting in a local theater group. Moving back and forth between bit parts in California and on Broadway, Burr finally signed a contract with RKO, despite his fictional rï¿½sumï¿½ that claimed he spent time on the London stage. His deep baritone and imposing frame made him the perfect heavy in a string of RKO thrillers. But it was his role as Perry Mason on TV that made Burr a household name. Running from 1957 to 1966, the CBS courtroom drama featured Mason eliciting confessions on the witness stand and never losing a case to his arch nemesis, DA Hamilton Burger. Burr's private life, most notably his long-term relationship with Robert Benevides, was kept quiet, primarily through the dead spouses Burr invented along the way. Working steadily until his death in 1993 from cancer, Burr remained a television icon, following up the success of Mason with <i>Ironside</i>, where he played a paraplegic cop. Starr, who has biographies of Joey Bishop and Bobby Darin, does little to illuminate the actor or the man, and sidesteps a much-needed exploration of homosexuality in Burr's Hollywood. <i>(May)</i> <br>Copyright ï¿½ Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Sandra and her husband, Michael Brown, live in Arlington, Texas.Ricochet <br>CHAPTER<br>1<br> <br>Six Weeks Earlier<br> <br>THE MURDER TRIAL OF ROBERT SAVICH WAS in its fourth day.<br> <br>Homicide detective Duncan Hatcher was wondering what the hell was going on.<br> <br>As soon as court had reconvened after the lunch break, the defendant&#x2019;s attorney, Stan Adams, had asked the judge for a private meeting. Judge Laird, as perplexed by the request as ADA Mike Nelson, had nonetheless granted it and the three had withdrawn to chambers. The jury had retired to the jury room, leaving only the spectators to question the significance of this unexpected conference.<br> <br>They&#x2019;d been out for half an hour. Duncan&#x2019;s anxiety grew with each passing minute. He&#x2019;d wanted the trial to proceed without a blip, without any hitch that could result in an easy appeal or, God forbid, an overturned verdict. That&#x2019;s why this behind-closed-doors powwow was making him so nervous.<br> <br>His impatience eventually drove him out into the corridor, where he paced, but never out of earshot of the courtroom. From this fourth-floor vantage point, he watched a pair of tugs guide a merchant ship along the channel toward the ocean. Then, unable to stand the suspense, he returned to his seat in the courtroom.<br> <br>&#x201c;Duncan, for heaven&#x2019;s sake, sit still! You&#x2019;re squirming like a two-year-old.&#x201d; To pass the time, his partner detective, DeeDee Bowen, was working a crossword puzzle.<br> <br>&#x201c;What could they be talking about in there?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Plea bargain? Manslaughter, maybe?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Get real,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Savich wouldn&#x2019;t admit to a parking violation, much less a hit.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s a seven-letter word for surrender?&#x201d; DeeDee asked.<br> <br>&#x201c;Abdicate.&#x201d;<br> <br>She looked at him with annoyance. &#x201c;How&#x2019;d you come up with that so fast?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m a genius.&#x201d;<br> <br>She tried the word. &#x201c;Not this time. &#x2018;Abdicate&#x2019; doesn&#x2019;t fit. Besides, that&#x2019;s eight letters.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Then I don&#x2019;t know.&#x201d;<br> <br>The defendant, Robert Savich, was seated at the defense table looking way too complacent for a man on trial for murder, and much too confident to allay Duncan&#x2019;s anxiety. As though feeling Duncan&#x2019;s stare on the back of his neck, Savich turned and smiled at him. His fingers continued to idly drum the arms of his chair as though keeping time to a catchy tune only he could hear. His legs were casually crossed. He was a portrait of composure.<br> <br>To anyone who didn&#x2019;t know him, Robert Savich looked like a respectable businessman with a slightly rebellious flair for fashion. For court today he was dressed in a suit of conservative gray, but the slim tailoring of it was distinctly European. His shirt was pale blue, his necktie lavender. His signature ponytail was sleek and glossy. A multicarat diamond glittered from his earlobe.<br> <br>The classy clothes, his insouciance, were elements of his polished veneer, which gave no indication of the unconscionable criminal behind them.<br> <br>He&#x2019;d been arrested and brought before the grand jury on numerous charges that included several murders, one arson, and various lesser felonies, most of which were related to drug trafficking. But over the course of his long and illustrious career, he&#x2019;d been indicted and tried only twice. The first had been a drug charge. He&#x2019;d been acquitted because the state failed to prove their case, which, granted, was flimsy.<br> <br>His second trial was for the murder of one Andre Bonnet. Savich had blown up his house. Along with ATF agents, Duncan had investigated the homicide. Unfortunately, most of the evidence was circumstantial, but had been believed strong enough to win a conviction. However, the DA&#x2019;s office had assigned a green prosecutor who didn&#x2019;t have the savvy or experience necessary to convince all the jurors of Savich&#x2019;s guilt. The trial had resulted in a hung jury.<br> <br>But it hadn&#x2019;t ended there. It was discovered that the young ADA had also withheld exculpatory evidence from attorney Stan Adams. The hue and cry he raised made the DA&#x2019;s office gun-shy to prosecute again in any sort of timely fashion. The case remained on the books and probably would until the polar ice caps melted.<br> <br>Duncan had taken that defeat hard. Despite the young prosecutor&#x2019;s bungling, he&#x2019;d regarded it a personal failure and had dedicated himself to putting an end to Savich&#x2019;s thriving criminal career.<br> <br>This time, he was betting the farm on a conviction. Savich was charged with the murder of Freddy Morris, one of his many employees, a drug dealer whom undercover narcotics officers had caught making and distributing methamphetamine. The evidence against Freddy Morris had been indisputable, his conviction virtually guaranteed, and, since he was a repeat offender, he&#x2019;d face years of hard time.<br> <br>The DEA and the police department&#x2019;s narcs got together and offered Freddy Morris a deal&#x2014;reduced charges and significantly less prison time in exchange for his boss Savich, who was the kingpin they were really after.<br> <br>In light of the prison sentence he was facing, Freddy had accepted the offer. But before the carefully planned sting could be executed, Freddy was. He was found lying facedown in a marsh with a bullet hole in the back of his head.<br> <br>Duncan was confident that Savich wouldn&#x2019;t escape conviction this time. The prosecutor was less optimistic. &#x201c;I hope you&#x2019;re right, Dunk,&#x201d; Mike Nelson had said the previous evening as he&#x2019;d coached Duncan on his upcoming appearance on the witness stand. &#x201c;A lot hinges on your testimony.&#x201d; Tugging on his lower lip, he&#x2019;d added thoughtfully, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m afraid that Adams is going to hammer us on the probable cause issue.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I had probable cause to question Savich,&#x201d; Duncan insisted. &#x201c;Freddy&#x2019;s first reaction to the offer was to say that if he even farted in our direction, Savich would cut out his tongue. So, when I&#x2019;m looking down at Freddy&#x2019;s corpse, I see that not only is his brain an oozing mush, his tongue has been cut out. According to the ME, it was cut out while he was still alive. You don&#x2019;t think that gave me probable cause to go after Savich immediately?&#x201d;<br> <br>The blood had been fresh and Freddy&#x2019;s body still warm when Duncan and DeeDee were called to the grisly scene. DEA officers and SPD narcs were engaged in a battle royal over who had blown Freddy&#x2019;s cover.<br> <br>&#x201c;You were supposed to have three men monitoring his every move,&#x201d; one of the DEA agents yelled at his police counterpart.<br> <br>&#x201c;You had four! Where were they?&#x201d; the narc yelled back.<br> <br>&#x201c;They thought he was safe at home.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yeah? Well, so did we.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Jesus!&#x201d; the federal agent swore in frustration. &#x201c;How&#x2019;d he slip past us?&#x201d;<br> <br>No matter who had botched the sting, Freddy was no longer any use to them and quarreling about it was a waste of time. Leaving DeeDee to referee the two factions swapping invectives and blame, Duncan had gone after Savich.<br> <br>&#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t plan on arresting him,&#x201d; Duncan had explained to Mike Nelson. &#x201c;I only went to his office to question him. Swear to God.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You fought with him, Dunk. That may hurt us. Adams isn&#x2019;t going to let that get past the jury. He&#x2019;s going to hint at police brutality, if not accuse you outright. False arrest. Hell, I don&#x2019;t know what all he&#x2019;ll pull out of the hat.&#x201d;<br> <br>He&#x2019;d ended by tacking on a reminder that nothing was a sure thing and that anything could happen during a trial.<br> <br>Duncan didn&#x2019;t understand the ADA&#x2019;s concern. To him it seemed clear-cut and easily understood. He&#x2019;d gone directly from the scene of Freddy Morris&#x2019;s murder to Savich&#x2019;s office. Duncan had barged in unannounced to find Savich in the company of a woman later identified by mug shots as Lucille Jones, who was on her knees fellating him.<br> <br>This morning, Duncan&#x2019;s testimony about that had caused a hush to fall over the courtroom. Restless movements ceased. The bailiff, who had been dozing, sat up, suddenly wakeful. Duncan glanced at the jury box. One of the older women ducked her head in embarrassment. Another, a contemporary of the first, appeared confused as to the meaning of the word. One of the four male jurors looked at Savich with a smirk of admiration. Savich was examining his fingernails as though considering a manicure later in the day.<br> <br>Duncan had testified that the moment he entered Savich&#x2019;s office, Savich had reached for a gun. &#x201c;A pistol was lying on his desk. He lunged toward it. I knew I&#x2019;d be dead if he got hold of that weapon.&#x201d;<br> <br>Adams came to his feet. &#x201c;Objection, Your Honor. Conclusion.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Sustained.&#x201d;<br> <br>Mike Nelson amended his question and eventually established with the jurors that Duncan had rushed Savich only to defend himself from possible harm. The ensuing struggle was intense, but finally Duncan was able to restrain Savich.<br> <br>&#x201c;And once you had subdued Mr. Savich,&#x201d; the prosecutor said, &#x201c;did you confiscate that weapon as evidence, Detective Hatcher?&#x201d;<br> <br>Here&#x2019;s where it got tricky. &#x201c;No. By the time I had Savich in restraints, the pistol had disappeared and so had the woman.&#x201d;<br> <br>Neither had been seen since.<br> <br>Duncan arrested Savich for assault on a police officer. While he was being held on that charge, Duncan, DeeDee, and other officers had constructed a case against him for the murder of Freddy Morris.<br> <br>They didn&#x2019;t have the weapon that Duncan had seen, which they were certain Savich had used to slay Freddy Morris less than an hour earlier. They didn&#x2019;t have the testimony of the woman. They didn&#x2019;t even have footprints or tire prints at the scene because the tide had come in and washed them away prior to the discovery of the body.<br> <br>What they did have was the testimony of several other agents who&#x2019;d heard Freddy&#x2019;s fearful claim that Savich would cut out his tongue and then kill him if he made a deal with the authorities, or even talked to them. And, since Lucille Jones&#x2019;s whereabouts were unknown, Savich couldn&#x2019;t produce a credible alibi. The DA&#x2019;s office had won convictions on less, so the case had come to trial.<br> <br>Nelson expected Duncan would get hammered by Savich&#x2019;s attorney during cross-examination that afternoon. Over lunch, he had tried to prepare him for it. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s going to claim harassment and tell the jury that you&#x2019;ve harbored a personal grudge against his client for years.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You bet your ass, I have,&#x201d; Duncan said. &#x201c;The son of a bitch is a killer. It&#x2019;s my sworn duty to catch killers.&#x201d;<br> <br>Nelson sighed. &#x201c;Just don&#x2019;t let it sound personal, all right?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll try.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Even though it is.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I said I&#x2019;ll try, Mike. But, yeah, it&#x2019;s become personal.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Adams is going to claim that Savich has a permit to carry a handgun, so the weapon itself isn&#x2019;t incriminating. And then he&#x2019;s going to claim that there never was a weapon. He may even question if there was really a woman giving him a blow job. He&#x2019;ll deny, deny, deny, and build up a mountain of doubt in the jurors&#x2019; minds. He may even make a motion to dismiss your entire testimony since there&#x2019;s no corroboration.&#x201d;<br> <br>Duncan knew what he was up against. He&#x2019;d come up against Stan Adams before. But he was anxious to get on with it.<br> <br>He was staring at the door leading to the judge&#x2019;s chambers, willing it to open, when it actually did.<br> <br>&#x201c;All rise,&#x201d; the bailiff intoned.<br> <br>Duncan shot to his feet. He searched the expressions of the three men as they reentered the courtroom and resumed their places. He leaned toward DeeDee. &#x201c;What think you?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know, but I don&#x2019;t like it.&#x201d;<br> <br>His partner had an uncanny and reliable talent for reading people and situations, and she had just validated the foreboding he was feeling.<br> <br>Another bad sign&#x2014;Mike Nelson kept his head averted and didn&#x2019;t look in their direction.<br> <br>Stan Adams sat down beside his client and patted the sleeve of Savich&#x2019;s expensive suit.<br> <br>Duncan&#x2019;s gut tightened with apprehension.<br> <br>The judge stepped onto the bench and signaled the bailiff to ask the jury to return. He took his seat behind the podium and carefully arranged his robe. He scooted the tray holding a drinking glass and a carafe of water one-half inch to his right and adjusted the microphone, which needed no adjustment.<br> <br>Once the jury had filed in and everyone was situated, he said, &#x201c;Ladies and gentlemen, I apologize for the delay, but a matter of importance had to be addressed immediately.&#x201d;<br> <br>Cato Laird was a popular judge, with the public and with the media, which he courted like a suitor. Nearing fifty, he had the physique of a thirty-year-old and the facial features of a movie star. In fact, a few years earlier he had played a cameo role of a judge in a movie filmed in Savannah.<br> <br>Comfortable in front of cameras, he could be counted on to provide a sound bite whenever a news story revolved around crime, criminals, or jurisprudence. He was speaking in that well-known, often-heard silver-tongued tone now. &#x201c;Mr. Adams has brought to my attention that during voir dire, juror number ten failed to disclose that her son is enrolled in the next class of candidate officers for the Savannah&#x2013;Chatham Metropolitan Police Department.&#x201d;<br> <br>Duncan glanced at the jury box and noticed the empty chair in the second row.<br> <br>&#x201c;Oh, jeez,&#x201d; DeeDee said under her breath.<br> <br>&#x201c;The juror has admitted as much to me,&#x201d; Judge Laird said. &#x201c;She didn&#x2019;t intentionally try to deceive the court, she simply failed to recognize how that omission could affect the outcome of this trial.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What?&#x201d;<br> <br>DeeDee nudged Duncan, warning him to keep his voice down.<br> <br>The judge looked in their direction, but continued.<br> <br>&#x201c;When seating a jury, attorneys for each side have an opportunity to eliminate any individuals who they feel have the potential of swaying the verdict. Mr. Adams is of the opinion that a juror whose family member will soon become a police officer may have a fundamental prejudice against any defendant in a criminal trial, but especially one accused of this particularly egregious slaying.&#x201d;<br> <br>He paused, then said, &#x201c;I agree with counsel on this point and am therefore compelled to declare a mistrial.&#x201d; He banged his gavel. &#x201c;Jurors, you are dismissed. Mr. Adams, your client is free to go. Court is adjourned.&#x201d;<br> <br>Duncan came out of his chair. &#x201c;You have got to be kidding!&#x201d;<br> <br>The judge&#x2019;s gaze sought him out and, in a tone that could have cut a diamond, he said, &#x201c;I assure you I am not kidding, Detective Hatcher.&#x201d;<br> <br>Duncan stepped into the aisle and walked up it as far as the railing. He pointed at Savich. &#x201c;Your Honor, you cannot let him walk out of here.&#x201d;<br> <br>Mike Nelson was at his elbow, speaking under his breath. &#x201c;Dunk, calm down.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You can retry the case, Mr. Nelson,&#x201d; the judge said as he stood and prepared to leave. &#x201c;But I advise you to have more solid evidence before you do.&#x201d; He glanced at Duncan, adding, &#x201c;Or more credible testimony.&#x201d;<br> <br>Duncan saw red. &#x201c;You think I&#x2019;m lying?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Duncan.&#x201d;<br> <br>DeeDee had come up behind him and taken hold of his arm, trying to pull him back down the aisle toward the exit, but he yanked his arm free.<br> <br>&#x201c;The pistol was real. It was practically smoking. The woman was real. She jumped to her feet when I came in and&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>The judge banged his gavel, silencing him. &#x201c;You can testify at the next trial. If there is one.&#x201d;<br> <br>Suddenly Savich was in front of him, filling his field of vision, smiling. &#x201c;You blew it again, Hatcher.&#x201d;<br> <br>Mike Nelson grabbed Duncan&#x2019;s arm to keep him from vaulting over the railing. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m gonna nail you, you son of a bitch. Etch it into your skin. Tattoo it on your ass. I&#x2019;m gonna nail you.&#x201d;<br> <br>His voice rife with menace, Savich said, &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll be seeing you....</p><h2>Beyond Belief: The American Press And The Coming Of The Holocaust, 1933- 1945</h2><p>In this book, Deborah Lipstadt argues that, from 1933 to 1945, the American press failed to treat the destruction of European Jews as urgent news. When newspaper did report on the horrors being perpetrated, they adopted a skeptical posture, burying small stories with ambiguous headlines on inside pages. Lipstadt documents how the demand for objectivity, the cynicism or gullibility of reporters, the incredulity of editors, and an atmosphere of isolationism helped to shape the news - and influenced policymakers who might have saved countless lives.</p><p><b>Deborah Lipstadt</b>, author of <i>The Eichmann Trial</i> (2011), <i>History on Trial: My Day in Court with David Irving</i> (2005), and <i>Beyond Belief: The American Press and the Coming of the Holocaust</i>, 1933-45 (1986), occupies the Dorot Chair in Modern Jewish and Holocaust Studies at Emory University.This most complete study to date of American press reactions to the Holocaust sets forth in abundant detail how the press nationwide played down or even ignored reports of Jewish persecutions over a 12-year period. The conclusions amplify but do not seriously challenge previous studies; what is more significant here is the effortfar from completeto explain press actions. While revealing more about major newspapers and correspondents than about the mass of smaller ones, and saying far too little about newsreels and American Jewish newspapers, this raises larger questions concerning the relationship between press coverage, public knowledge, and government policy that deserve serious consideration. Readers may wish that Lipstadt explained more and indicted less. Still, there is plenty of important data in this volume for serious students. Jonathan D.

While reading this generous and eye-opening account, it's easy to see how, for the country at large, the rift has only deepened.&#x201d;&#x2014;<strong>Arianna Rebolini, Buzzfeed Best Books of Fall 2018</strong></p> <p>"Landing somewhere between Neil Gaiman and Juan Rulfo, Solis secularizes the mythological by turning men and women into saintly figures&#x2014;like their criada [maid], Consuelo, and a white priest who shows his family empathy&#x2014;and monsters: border agents who take his friends away and school bullies."&#x2014;<strong>Michael Adam Carroll, <em>The Millions</em></strong></p> <p>"There has never been a border book like <em>Retablos</em>, a collection of smoldering epiphanies suffering the baptizing waters of recall. . . ."&#x2014;<strong>Roberto Ontiveros, <em>San Antonio Current</em> </strong></p> <p>"The book is rendered in tight, stand-alone recollections rich with poetry and honesty. . . . If retablos are offerings, then Solis' book is a gift of memory, not always pleasant, but always true."&#x2014;<strong>Beatriz Terrazas, Dallas Morning News</strong></p> <p>"The experience of reading his tightly contained memories in succession is a bit like drawing old coins up from a wishing well. Filtered through veils of distance and time, these scenes and reflections are wonderful and weird flashes of childhood, adolescence and early adulthood in the life of this particular Mexican American boy."-- <strong>Sophie Haigney, <em>San Francisco Chronicle</em></strong></p> <p>"Octavio Solis' <em>Retablos</em> recounts a 'beautiful, messy' youth on the border. Though its title evokes Mexican folk art, Retablos is closer in effect to that of French pointillism. Its small dabs of vivid color produce a brilliant cumulative effect."&#x2014;<strong>Steven G. Kellman, <em>The Texas Observer</em></strong></p> <p>"In this debut memoir, playwright Solis delivers top-notch vignettes of his youth with riveting imagery and empathy, recounting--and embellishing, he says--memories of growing up brown in El Paso, Tex. . . . These brilliantly told stories of missteps and redemption are a treat."<strong>--<em>Publishers Weekly</em></strong></p> <p>". . .what struck me most about each chapter was Solis's ability to plant a specific image in your mind. With every retablo, you can see in ferocious detail exactly what the author wants you to see, like a special kind of telepathy. I found myself wanting to paint them<strong>.</strong><strong>"</strong><strong>&#x2014;Caitlyn Reynolds, <em>The Los Angeles Review of Books</em></strong></p> <p>"In all, a beautiful, evocative, and timely expression of border culture for every collection."<strong>--Sara Martinez, <em>Booklist</em></strong></p> <p>"In this coming-of-age memoir, a playwright illuminates the culture of the El Paso border as he perceived it when he was young. . . .

I&#x2019;m at a loss to explain how I got here.</p> <p>It&#x2019;s my first week as a sophomore, and instead of enjoying the afternoons watching TV and doing my homework at my leisure, I&#x2019;m at the first reading of The Diary of Anne Frank at my school. All these poor idiots are sitting in a circle with me, also wondering how they got here, some of them pleased as punch, others with the same perplexed look that&#x2019;s plastered on my face. We&#x2019;re assembled in the auditorium, which also passes for the basketball court gymnasium. Listening to our drama coach laying down the laws of daily rehearsal. Miss G. is a feisty West-Texan battleax of a woman, built like a bulldog with close cropped hair and glasses, and she&#x2019;s calmly setting forth the hours and days we&#x2019;ll be working and underscoring her expectations of us as actors in the show. She&#x2019;s grinning all smug and shit &#x2018;cause she knows some of us will defy these expectations for which she&#x2019;s got gallons of two-fisted fury saved up in her compact frame. For now, her bearing is enough to keep us in line. All I&#x2019;m thinking is, shit, my afternoons are shot to hell forever.</p> <p>What&#x2019;s worse is that now she has us holding hands and bowing our heads for prayer circle. She&#x2019;s calling for Jesus to bless our production, assuring him that we&#x2019;re only here to do his will, even though the play is about Jews in Nazi Europe. I&#x2019;m confused and dismayed as this cycle of prayer goes on for a full fifteen minutes, with other students chiming in their amens and yes-fathers. If this is going to happen every time we meet for play practice, then I&#x2019;m done. I&#x2019;m already suffocating in all this sudden godliness, all these rules, all the hours wasted in a cavernous gym with this tough bespectacled teacher crying halleluyah. I don&#x2019;t know how she managed to get me to agree to be in this show, but I&#x2019;m getting out of this obligation quick. I resolve to sit through this one session with as good an attitude as I can rally up but when it&#x2019;s over, it&#x2019;s over. I&#x2019;m not coming back. Not even if I&#x2019;m playing Peter Van Daam, which is one of the young leads in the play. I don&#x2019;t care. Let them find someone else.</p> <p>Finally, with everyone already worked up on Jesus, we take our seats in the circle as Miss G. passes out the scripts for the play. She reminds us who&#x2019;s playing what role and directs us to read loudly, with feeling and enunciation. That last word is new to me but it sounds pretty religious. We open the scripts and begin reading, and gradually, with the first girl&#x2019;s voice taking on the words of Anne Frank, the physics in the room begin to change. I feel the voice of this dark long-haired Mexican schoolgirl peel away the walls of the gym to reveal wartime Amsterdam, and then I see Anne herself huddled with her diary in the secret attic of her tragic story. Within the empty space of the circle, other voices around me lay forth the vivid action of the play with passion, energy and conviction until it&#x2019;s my turn and then some impulse takes over and I&#x2019;m not me anymore but Peter himself aching for sunlight and a place of no fear and the love of a young girl. The words go in my eyes and come out my mouth with all the heart I can summon and in that magical spell, the school and the impossible classloads and the gangs that chase me on the way home and the Border Patrol and the tensions of home and my personal anxieties about who the fuck I am and all the lived experience that make my town this unspectacular, sporadically dangerous place simply go away. I am somewhere in the mind of a teenage girl who disappeared into the death camps of our cruel past, inhabiting her words like they&#x2019;re the only world that matters. When we get to the end, our Anne is openly crying as a mournful hush falls over us. I am choked up with bewilderment. I want to know how this happened, how we made the world vanish for these few hours of reading.</p> <p>After we stand and hold hands one more time for an adjourning prayer, Miss G. comes to me while I gather my homework to go home. She obviously senses my confusion. With my eyes on the script, I want to tell her it&#x2019;s a miracle, this play is a miracle, how it made all the people and things, all my cares and worries of my world, evaporate into nothing.</p> <p>But she beats me to it, saying, Well. You&#x2019;re still here.</p> <p>I look at her. I want to ask what she means.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>She smiles that smug smile that knows I&#x2019;ll violate, maybe even exceed, her expectations, and turns to go turn off the gymnasium lights, while I walk home in the dark, eager to find my heart again in wartime Amsterdam.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>IN THE SHIMMER</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>In the clouded window of my early childhood, I perceive my grandmother. Mamï¿½ Concha we call her. She&#x2019;s undoing hair rollers and applying bright red lipstick before the bathroom mirror. I see her short stocky legs in their saggy hose slip into her shoes with the blocky heels. Her purse is redolent with the fragrance of Wrigley&#x2019;s Chewing Gum and scented tissues that seem to burst from inside every time she unclasps it. She gives me half a stick of spearmint, slipping the other half in her mouth. She dresses me up in my best shirt and pants and combs my hair till it&#x2019;s waxed down like Alfalfa&#x2019;s in the Our Gang serials. Then we&#x2019;re outside.</p> <p>I perceive her sitting beside me on the city bus noisily taking us downtown. I watch her nervous hands smooth the pinstripes of her blue cotton dress over and over while she smacks the gum in her mouth and stares straight ahead like a lover on her way to an assignation. The bus driver asks her something in Spanish and she answers in the old country manner.</p> <p>Ay.</p> <p>I catch his gaze through the mirror over his head, how his eyes probe and ponder over us during the whole length of the ride. She takes a tissue from her purse and with a little spit on it wipes the scuff off my shoes, which dangle just off the seat, and she reties my laces till my feet throb. I hear the gassy exhalation of the bus heaving to a stop and the door swishing open to <em>la Placita de los Lagartos</em>, which is teeming with more people than I&#x2019;ve ever seen in my life. The sun is high and bright. I perceive the tightness of her grip on my soft hand as she guides us to the central fountain in the tree-lined plaza, where she lifts me up with her sturdy arms to her bosom and shows me the alligators basking in the radiant heat. One of them is dozing in its pond, and one has its jaws wide open, a soft-serve ice cream cone melting on its back. I count the cigarette butts and candy wrappers floating in the pond all around them. Is this what we came to see? No, not this.</p> <p>I perceive more people gathering in the plaza and in the windows of the buildings around us. They&#x2019;re crowded together for a view of something to come. Above them the sky is a brilliant unsullied blue that scares me, it&#x2019;s so wide and cloudless and perfect. My grandmother takes me by the hand and pushes through the mass of people, all of them murmuring and speaking and some even shouting. She&#x2019;s smaller than most of them but with her purse she rams a path toward the more crowded edge of the plaza. Some people give her the stink-eye, some of them jab their elbows back and sneer at me, but she&#x2019;s dogged in her mission.</p> <p>Then I lose her. Somehow, our knotted fingers fray and set me loose among the dense forest of legs and shoes and handbags and even a little weenie dog on a leash, panting with fear and heat and congestion, and I think I must have the same look as I call out for her. Mamï¿½ Concha! Mamï¿½ Concha! I feel the crowd surge in one direction and knock me down and some lady&#x2019;s heel stamps on my hand and I start to cry. The sounds of several cars coming to a stop somewhere near set off a riotous noise that drowns out my cries. Shifting bodies pressed hard against each other buffet me about like a piï¿½ata. Frantic, I look straight up for even a fragment of that blue sky but now it&#x2019;s a swarm of balloons and millions of tiny shreds of colored paper flitting and falling like snowflakes on everyone. This clamor of yelling and screaming, I feel it in my teeth, my bones, all the way down to my feet, till the ground is bellowing against the weight of all these stomping, bounding, jerking feet. The storm of people is so total, so consuming and suffocating, and it moves with such a single anarchic mind, that I think I&#x2019;ll drown in it, I think I&#x2019;ll die. I scream with all my strength, MAMï¿½ CONCHA! But I can&#x2019;t hear myself. I can&#x2019;t hear anything but this crazy thunder of voices.</p> <p>Out of this frenzy, the hands of my grandmother descend and take me by the ribs and lift me up, up, above the throng, and aim me in the direction of the Hotel Cortez across the street. I&#x2019;m blinded by the glare of the sun&#x2019;s reflection in the windows, rectangles of glass flashing into my eyes. Then, for just a moment, through the starbursts of white sunlight and a thousand hands raised in some kind of jubilation, I see a man&#x2019;s epic smile on a head of blazing red hair, all teeth and red-orange hair and his hand running through it before it waves at the crowd, waves distinctly at me, too, this man with fire in his hair and eyes of Olympian blue and a smile that encompasses all of us appears for just a glimpse before I lose him again in the shimmer, but I&#x2019;m above the tumult now, tears glistening on my flushed cheeks, pale and hot, numb and blind, bounced along to the chants of Viva Kennedy! ï¿½Viva Kennedy! ï¿½Viva Kennedy!</p> <p>&nbsp;</p></p><h2>The Letters to Timothy and Titus (NEW INTERNATIONAL COMMENTARY ON THE NEW TESTAMENT)</h2><p>The most accessible, most broadly pitched full-length commentary on Timothy and Titus, this NICNT volume explores Paul's three letters to Timothy and Titus within their historical, religious, and cultural settings.<br><br>In his introduction, Towner sets out the rationale for his historical approach, questions certain assumptions of recent critical scholarship, and establishes the uniqueness and individuality of each letter.

In his <i>Discourse on Method</i> he outlined the contrast between mathematics and experimental sciences, and the extent to which each one can achieve certainty. Drawing on his own work in geometry, optics, astronomy and physiology, Descartes developed the hypothetical method that characterizes modern science, and this soon came to replace the traditional techniques derived from Aristotle. Many of Descartes&#x2019; most radical ideas&#x2014;such as the disparity between our perceptions and the realities that cause them&#x2014;have been highly influential in the development of modern philosophy.This edition sets the Discourse on Method in the wider context of Descartes&#x2019; work, with the <i>Rules for Guiding One&#x2019;s Intelligence in Searching for the Truth</i> (1628), extracts from <i>The World</i> (1633) and selected letters from 1636-9.

At her confirmation in 1597, she took the name of Rose, because, when an infant, her face had been seen transformed by a mystical rose. As a child she was remarkable for a great reverence, and pronounced love, for all things relating to God.

The Mount Saint Vincent College awarded her a Licentiate of Music degree when she was just seventeen, and she began writing Catholic works when she was about twenty-four. Later she sent one of her stories to a Catholic magazine, and after it was accepted, she continued to write. In total she composed at least twenty-one children's books, as well as periodical children's pages written for The Torch, a monthly Dominican magazine.<br> Mary Windeatt is most renowned for her many novels of the saints, which she wrote specifically for children, including lives on the Children of Fatima, Cure of Ars, St. Thomas Aquinas, St. Rose of Lima and many others.

But just as he's packing his bags, Harry receives a warning from a strange, impish creature named Dobby who says that if Harry Potter returns to Hogwarts, disaster will strike.<br><br>And strike it does. For in Harry's second year at Hogwarts, fresh torments and horrors arise, including an outrageously stuck-up new professor, Gilderoy Lockheart, a spirit named Moaning Myrtle who haunts the girls' bathroom, and the unwanted attentions of Ron Weasley's younger sister, Ginny.<br><br>But each of these seem minor annoyances when the real trouble begins, and someone--or something--starts turning Hogwarts students to stone. Could it be Draco Malfoy, a more poisonous rival than ever? Could it possibly be Hagrid, whose mysterious past is finally told? Or could it be the one everyone at Hogwarts most suspects...Harry Potter himself?</p><p>What makes the Harry Potter series so successful? Maybe it's the fact that J.K. Rowling doesn't write children's books, she writes children's stories, more in the tradition of the Brothers Grimm than Dr. Seuss. The exploits of Harry and his friends captivate even the shortest attention spans by engaging the imagination with vivid characters and fast-moving action, instead of trying to merely catch the eye with colorful pictures or pop-up effects. Not surprisingly, the Potter tales sound wonderful read aloud, and adapt to the audiobook format extremely well. Broadway actor Jim Dale's impressive vocal range gives each character in the book its own distinctive voice--a considerable task, given the pantheon of witches, warlocks, ghosts, ghouls, dwarves, and elves that Harry encounters in his second outing. And thankfully, since the book is read unabridged, no one's favorite character is omitted. Engaging for children without being childish, the audio version of <i>Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets</i> is worthy addition to the deservedly popular series.

Born in Warsaw to a long line of Hasidic rabbis, he chose instead to study philosophy in Germany. Expelled back to Warsaw, he escaped just weeks before the Nazi invasion and settled in the United States. Through a series of books he contributed greatly to the spiritual renewal of Judaism.

As the first text on pulse diagnosis for the Western student, this book provides a method by which anyone can learn to read his own pulse. Imbalances and potential disease states can be detected in their early stages, giving one the opportunity to correct them before they affect the quality of life. With practice and guidance, one can acquire the proficiency to use this knowledge to heal self and others.</p><p>Because of the interest in Ayurveda in the hearts of both practitioners and laymen and because of the demand, I have been teaching seminars on pulse diagnosis across the United States, England and at the Ayurvedic Institute in Albuquerque, New Mexico. <p>In any system of medicine, pulse assessment is a matter of technical skill, subjective experience and intuition. Accuracy also depends upon the individualï¿½s persistent practice and quality of sensitive awareness. Several teachers, gurus and yogis in India influenced my early education in pulse reading. Even though simplified descriptions of various conditions of the pulse are found in the standard Ayurvedic texts, the methods of examination are not given in detail. However, it is possible to learn these subjective methods of pulse examination that reveal the characteristics of the individualï¿½s prakruti, vikruti and various doshic disorders and to verify their accuracy objectively. </p> <p>The purpose of this book is to teach simplified techniques to students and to provide deep comprehensive information as well. Throughout my earlier Ayurvedic education, I also studied modern allopathic medicine and this knowledge has broadened my interpretation of pulse reading. </p> <p>All of what I am sharing with you in this book may not be found in the standard Ayurvedic texts. However, all that I have included here is based upon Ayurvedic principles. I received this knowledge from my mentors in the Ayurvedic tradition and it has since unfolded in my heart through clinical observation and practice over the last 25 years. </p> <p>This book will give guidelines to think about various ways of feeling, reading and gathering information through the pulse. It is quite difficult to put subjective experience into words. This is my sincere attempt to express these simple ways of feeling the pulse. I hope, dear readers, that you will love this humble effort. </p> <p>Love and light, </p> <p>Dr. Vasant Lad<br> Albuquerque, New Mexico<br> May 1996</p>Dr. Vasant Lad, BAMS, MASc, brings a wealth of classroom and practical experience to the United States.

[Blanning] brings knowledge, expertise, sound judgment and a colorful narrative style."--<i>The Economist</i><br><br>The <i>New York Times </i>bestselling volume in the Penguin History of Europe series</b><br><br>Between the end of the Thirty Years' War and the Battle of Waterloo, Europe underwent an extraordinary transformatoin that saw five of the modern world's great revolutions--scientific, industrial, American, French, and romantic. In this much-admired addition to the monumental Penguin History of Europe series, Tim Blanning brilliantly investigates the forces that transformed Europe from a medieval society into a vigorous powerhose of the modern world. Blanning renders this vast subject immediate and absorbing by making fresh connections between the most mundane details of life and the major cultural, political, and technological transformations that birthed the modern age.</p><p><b>Tim Blanning</b>&nbsp;is professor of modern history at the University of Cambridge, a Fellow of the British Academy, and the author and editor of numerour books on European history. He appears regularly on BBC Radio in England.In 1648 the Peace of Westphalia brought the Thirty Years War to an end. Although the Europeans didnt know it, of course, this devastating conflict would prove to be the last of the Wars of Religion that had been tearing the continent apart since the start of the Reformation in 1517. Europe was entering a new age. <br> Despite the Renaissance, it was still a largely medieval world in its outlook, infrastructure and government in 1648. Europe was less wealthy and, in many ways, less economically advanced than other parts of the world, like Mughal India and China. By 1815, the year of the Battle of Waterloo, Europe was recognizably modern. It was also far in advance of the rest of the world economically, scientifically, technologically, politically and militarily. <br> So the period between these two dates is the very hinge of European history. It is no small accomplishment to cover so vast a subject adequately in a single volume. But Tim Blanning, a professor of modern history at Cambridge and a fellow of the British Academy, not only does so, he also triumphs at it. The Pursuit of Glory, at 708 pages, is not a short read, but it is so well written that for those who love history, it is a page turner. <br> Mr. Blanning accomplishes his task not by taking a strictly chronological approach but by dealing with various aspects of a rapidly changing Europe one by one. Consider communications. In 1648 the main roads in Europe were mostly the ones that the Romans had built 1,500 years earlier and that had been neglected ever since. <br> The pace of travel, therefore, was seldom more than the speed a man could make on his own two feet, which, indeed, is how most people traveled. What coachesthere were were wretched and slow. In 1708 an envoy from Louis XIV to Madrid reported from Bayonne, in southwestern France, that he had been nine days on the road and expected that he would need another two weeks to reach the Spanish capital. <br> But by the end of the period, roads had much improved in Western Europe and with it the speed of travel. In France travel times were cut in half and the comfort of riding in coaches much improved by the better roads. In Britain matters were even better. The trip from Bath to London took 50 hours in 1700. By 1800 it took 16. These greatly improved roads allowed other improvements, like much more efficient and much less costly postal service. <br> This sort of history can be deadly dull, an endless recitation of facts and statistics. In Mr. Blannings hands it is not, because he has a keen eye for the exactly apposite contemporary quotation. The people who lived through this transportation revolution regarded it with the same wonder that we regard, say, the global positioning systems that now keep us from getting lost. In 1754 a newspaper advertisement proclaimed, However incredible it may appear, this coach will actually arrive in London four days after leaving Manchester. <br> Mr. Blanning is also the master of the unexpected connection. The greatly improved roads, and thus greatly increased traffic, had an entirely unanticipated consequence: highwaymen. The reason that the 18th century saw these gentlemen of the road turn into figures of romance and legend is simply that the improved roads provided them with so many more people of whom they could demand that they stand and deliver. <br> Mr. Blanning uses this technique over and over, alwayswith good effect. Why did France develop economically so much more slowly than Britain in the 18th century, with huge political consequences? One important reason was that Britain had an internal common market, but France was still riddled with internal tariffs and local taxes, causing no end of economic discontinuities. <br> An English traveler reported in 1786 that a nobleman of Berry told me that on one side of a rivulet which flows by his chateau, salt is sold at 40 sols a bushel, and on the other ... at 40 times as much. In consequence of this, no less than two thousand troops of horse and foot were stationed on its banks to check smugglers. <br> While everyone likely to read this book has heard of the scientific revolution, brought about by people like Isaac Newton, and the industrial revolution that began toward the end of the period (both well covered here), the agricultural revolution occurring at the same time was equally important. In 1648 European agriculture had not changed much since medieval times. But enclosure, manuring, crop rotation, new crops like turnips and clover, and improved breeding brought forth a large increase in food production. <br> One result was a golden age for the landed gentry, whose rent rolls increased sharply, and their conspicuous consumption along with them. (Robert Walpole employed 50 people just to weed his gardens.) Another result was the freeing of manpower to work in the factories that were beginning to spring up in the English countryside. The industrial revolution came about because of turnips as well as steam engines. <br> Mr. Blanning thoroughly covers the politics and endless wars of the era. These power shifts were not unconnected withthe two great political trends in Europe in this period: the development of representative government in Britain and the Dutch Republic and the growth of royal absolutism in much of the rest of Europe. Change thus came about in manageable increments in Britain, allowing it both to modernize efficiently and to accommodate a potent new political force public opinion, made possible by coffee houses and newspapers while change was bottled up until it exploded in France. <br> Even here, Mr. Blanning presents the historical nuggets that bring this book to such vibrant life. When Louis XVI learned that he was to die on the guillotine the next morning, he sent a servant to fetch a copy of David Humes History of England to learn how Charles I had faced his own execution. <br> "The Pursuit of Glory" is history writing at its glorious best. <br> John Steele Gordon (author of "An Empire of Wealth: The Epic History of American Economic Power"), "The New York Times"<br><br>aHistory writing at its glorious best.a<br> a"The New York Times" <br> a Magnificent.

It describes the complex origins of the conflict, the collapse of the Spanish Republic, and the outbreak of the only mass worker revolution in the history of Western Europe. Stanley Payne explains the character of the Spanish revolution and the complex web of republican politics, while also examining in detail the development of Franco&#39;s counterrevolutionary dictatorship. Payne gives attention to the multiple meanings and interpretations of war and examines why the conflict provoked such strong reactions in its own time, and long after. The book also explains the military history of the war and its place in the history of military development, the non-intervention policy of the democracies, and the role of German, Italian, and Soviet intervention, concluding with an analysis of the place of the war in European affairs and in comparative perspective of revolutionary civil wars of the twentieth century.</p><p>This book is the first general history of the Spanish Civil War to provide a clear and objective account of its origins in Spanish domestic affairs. It treats the most controversial issues - revolution, counterrevolution, political repressions, and foreign intervention and non-intervention, as well as giving a detailed examination of military affairs in a clear and objective perspective that is presented in non-technical terms for students and non-specialist readers.Stanley Payne has taught history at several universities, including Columbia University, University of California, Los Angeles and the University of Wisconsin. He is a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and a corresponding member of Real Academia Espaï¿½ola de la Historia, Madrid.

Van Gogh's tender and often ebullient letters provide a sharp contrast to the devastating and frequently violent mental breakdowns that plagued and eventually destroyed him. <br> <br> Collected and edited by art historian Mark Roskill, this volume also includes a chronology, a short memoir by van Gogh's sister-in-law that fills in many of the blanks of Vincent's early years, and reproductions of selected artwork discussed in van Gogh's letters. <br> <br> An epistolary classic, <i>The Letters of Vincent van Gogh</i> is not just an important historical collection but also a captivating treasure.</p><p>This thorough collection of van Gogh&#39;s letters has been assembled with an artful eye and sensitivity to the artist&#39;s thinking. The result is an atypical take on Vincent van Gogh that avoids putting too much stress on his troubled mental state and too much straining by the editor to shape a narrative out of van Gogh&#39;s epistolary clues. Instead, we see the thoughtful and contemplative side of this creative genius, as well as his concern for the impact his art and life had on those people closest to him.<b>Vincent Willem van Gogh</b> (1853-1890) was born in Holland. He became an assistant with an international firm of art-dealers and in 1881 he went to Brussels to study art. After an unsuccessful love affair with his cousin he returned to Holland and in 1885 he painted his first masterpiece, The Potato Eaters, a haunting scene of domestic poverty. A year later his brother Theo, an art dealer, enabled him to study in Paris, where he met Gauguin, Toulouse-Lautrec and Seurat, who became very important influences on his work.<br><br>In 1888 he left Paris for the Provenï¿½al landscape at Arles, the subject of many of his best works, including "Sunflowers" and "The Chair and the Pipe." It was here Van Gogh cut off his ear, in remorse for threatening Gauguin with a razor during a quarrel, and he was placed in an asylum for a year. On July 7, 1890 Van Gogh shot himself at the scene of his last painting, the foreboding "Cornfields with Flight of Birds," and he died two days later.<br><br><b>Ronald de Leeuw</b> has been the director of the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam since 1986. He trained as an art historian at the universities of Los Angeles, California, and of Leiden, The Netherlands. As a specialist in nineteenth-century painting, he has been responsible for numerous exhibitions in The Netherlands and abroad, including the 1990 Vincent Van Gogh Centennial retrospective in Amsterdam. Since 1990 Ronald de Leeuw has also directed the Museum Mesdag in The Hague, known for its fine Barbizon and Hague School holdings. In 1994 he was appointed professor extraordinary in the history of collecting at the Free University of Amsterdam.<br><br><b>Arnold Pomerans</b> was born in 1920 and was educated in South Africa. He emigrated to England in 1948, and from 1948 to 1955 taught physics in London.

The good news is that this same power&#x2014;the greatest power in the universe&#x2014;is available to every believer today.But most Christians never experience this power.

But spontaneous healing is also the essential element in the maintenance of our basic daily health. The book outlines an eight-week program that each of us can use to alter our diet, avoid environmental toxins, and reduce stress in order to enhance our innate healing powers.<br><br>The best medicine does not merely combat germs or suppress symptoms, but rather works hand in hand with the body's natural defenses to manage illness. Building on this fundamental truth and tapping into the intricate interaction of mind and body, Dr. Weil arrives at a major new synthesis of conventional and alternative medical treatments. At once practical and inspirational, <b>Spontaneous Healing</b> gives each one of us the power and the wisdom to draw on the sources of health we hold within.</p><p>It is clear that all organisms have highly developed mechanisms for self-repair and healing -- but according to Dr. Weil, Western medicine often interferes instead of working with these systems. In the course of his argument, he describes several extraordinary case studies of drastic spontaneous healing. Perhaps the most valuable feature of the book is his more gradual eight-week program of strengthening the ability of your immune, endocrine, circulatory, and nervous systems to provide such spontaneous healing.I think my mother is the long lost sister of Dr. Andrew Weil, author of Spontaneous Healing. As children, my brothers and sisters and I went to the doctor only for yearly check-ups. If we had a cough or cold, we would not be rushed to the doctor's office. For a few days we were treated with orange juice, chicken noodle soup, Vicks Vapo-Rub and TLC, until our bodies recovered, and this turned into our one illness of the year. A lot of my friends, however, who were always being rushed to the doctor, were also always being diagnosed with something or other and spent the winter months on antibiotics. Was I just generally more healthy? Maybe. But it seems now that to some extent my mother was mirroring the teachings of Dr. Weil, and letting our bodies respond to whatever was making us sick. <br>-- JMC</p><h2>Falling Home (A Falling Home Novel)</h2><p><b>A poignant story of two estranged sisters from the <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of the Tradd Street novels.</b><br><br>At twenty Cassie Madison left her hometown of Walton, Georgia, for New York City, where she has reinvented herself&#x2014;from losing herself in her career to squashing her accent. But one night a single phone call brings back everything she's tried to forget. She hasn't spoken to her sister since Harriet stole Cassie's fiancï¿½ and married him. But now Harriet's on the line with news that their father is dying. <br><br> As she makes the trip back, the only thing that frightens Cassie more than losing her father is seeing Harriet and the family that should have been hers. But she can't help loving her nephews and nieces any more than she can help feeling at home again in Walton. As she fights a surprising reaction to a forgotten friend, and faces an unexpected threat to the family she'd once left behind, Cassie comes to realize that moving on doesn't always mean moving away from who you are.</p><p>After many summers spent in my grandmother's small town in Mississippi, I suppose it was inevitable that my first contemporary romance, FALLING HOME, be set in a fictional southern town. Walton, Georgia is the kind of town where people congregate at a place called the Dixie Diner and whose inhabitants always pull together. And now Walton's prodigal daughter, Cassie Madison, is called home after 15 years in Manhattan. <p>Cassie finds herself sinking into the red Georgia clay as she is reluctantly pulled into the lives of her estranged sister and family, and that of Sam Parker, long forgotten classmate and now the town doctor. Then tragedy strikes. Can Cassie finally give up resentment and wounded pride to be the person her family needs? And can she accept Sam's love and give up everything she's worked so hard for?</p>You know that saying about how sometimes you're the windshield and sometimes you're the bug? <p>It's true. Take me, for example. I shook the Georgia dust from my feet fifteen years ago, vowing never to leave Manhattan. I traded sweet tea for Chardonnay, fried chicken for nouvelle cuisine, lazy days on my aunt's front porch for ad campaigns and board meetings, and the guy who broke my heart for my handsome boss, who soon became my fiance. Perfect, right? </p><p>Until my sister called. We haven't spoken since I left home--because she married the guy who broke my heart. What's more, she called to say my father is dying--but he refuses to finish until I show up. So I'm back in the hottest, dinkiest small town in Georgia, facing my sister and my old boyfriend over the heads of their--count them--five children. It couldn't get weirder, right? Unless you count Sam Parker--a long-forgotten classmate, now the town doctor--and how good he's beginning to look to me. </p><p>I'm falling apart, I think, wondering why resentment and wounded pride seem silly here in Walton, where forgiveness and acceptance go hand-in-hand with homecoming. And I'm beginning to suspect that I'm falling in love for real this time, with a man whose touch is so right, I feel like I'm... </p><p>Falling Home.</p></p><h2>The Foreign Correspondent (Night Soldiers)</h2><p>From Alan Furst, whom The New York Times calls &#x201c;America&#x2019;s preeminent spy novelist,&#x201d; comes an epic story of romantic love, love of country, and love of freedom&#x2013;the story of a secret war fought in elegant hotel bars and first-class railway cars, in the mountains of Spain and the backstreets of Berlin. It is an inspiring, thrilling saga of everyday people forced by their hearts&#x2019; passion to fight in the war against tyranny.<br><br>By 1938, hundreds of Italian intellectuals, lawyers and journalists, university professors and scientists had escaped Mussolini&#x2019;s fascist government and taken refuge in Paris. There, amid the struggles of ï¿½migrï¿½ life, they founded an Italian resistance, with an underground press that smuggled news and encouragement back to Italy. Fighting fascism with typewriters, they produced 512 clandestine newspapers. The Foreign Correspondent is their story.<br><br>Paris, a winter night in 1938: a murder/suicide at a discreet lovers&#x2019; hotel. But this is no romantic traged&#x2013;it is the work of the OVRA, Mussolini&#x2019;s fascist secret police, and is meant to eliminate the editor of Liberazione<i>, </i>a clandestine ï¿½migrï¿½ newspaper. Carlo Weisz, who has fled from Trieste and secured a job as a foreign correspondent with the Reuters bureau, becomes the new editor. <br>Weisz is, at that moment, in Spain, reporting on the last campaign of the Spanish civil war. But as soon as he returns to Paris, he is pursued by the French Sï¿½retï¿½<i>, </i>by agents of the OVRA, and by officers of the British Secret Intelligence Service. In the desperate politics of Europe on the edge of war, a foreign correspondent is a pawn, worth surveillance, or blackmail, or murder. <br><br>The Foreign Correspondent is the story of Carlo Weisz and a handful of antifascists: the army officer known as &#x201c;Colonel Ferrara,&#x201d; who fights for a lost cause in Spain; Arturo Salamone, the shrewd leader of a resistance group in Paris; and Christa von Schirren, the woman who becomes the love of Weisz&#x2019;s life, herself involved in a doomed resistance underground in Berlin.<br><br>The Foreign Correspondent is Alan Furst at his absolute best&#x2013;taut and powerful, enigmatic and romantic, with sharp, seductive writing that takes the reader through darkness and intrigue to a spectacular denouement.</p><p>Alan Furst is widely recognized as the master of the historical spy novel. He is the author of Night Soldiers, Dark Star, The Polish Officer, The World at Night, Red Gold, Kingdom of Shadows, Blood of Victory, and Dark Voyage. Born in New York, he has lived for long periods in France, especially Paris. He now lives on Long Island, New York. Visit the author&#x2019;s website at www.alanfurst.net.In Paris, the last days of autumn; a gray, troubled sky at daybreak, the fall of twilight at noon, followed, at seven-thirty, by slanting rains and black umbrellas as the people of the city hurried home past the bare trees. On the third of December, 1938, in the heart of the Seventh Arrondissement, a champagne-colored Lancia sedan turned the corner of the rue Saint-Dominique and rolled to a stop in the rue Augereau. Then the man in the backseat leaned forward for a moment and the chauffeur drove a few feet further and stopped again, this time in the shadow between two streetlamps.<br><br> The man in the back of the Lancia was called Ettore, il conte Amandola--the nineteenth Ettore, Hector, in the Amandola line, and count only the grandest of his titles. Closer to sixty than fifty, he had dark, slightly bulging eyes, as though life had surprised him, though it had never dared to do that, and a pink flush along his cheekbones, which suggested a bottle of wine with lunch, or excitement in the anticipation of an event planned for the evening. In fact, it was both. For the rest of his colors, he was a very silvery sort of man: his silver hair, gleaming with brilliantine, was brushed back to a smooth surface, and a thin silver mustache, trimmed daily with a scissors, traced his upper lip. Beneath a white wool overcoat, on the lapel of a gray silk suit, he wore a ribbon holding a silver Maltese cross on a blue enamel field, which meant he held the rank of cavaliere in the Order of the Crown of Italy. On the other lapel, the silver medal of the Italian Fascist party; a tipped square with diagonal fasces--a bundle of birch rods tied, with a red cord, to an axe. This symbolized the power of the consuls of the Roman Empire, who had the real rods and axe carried before them, and had the authority to beat with the birch rods, or behead with the axe.<br><br> Count Amandola looked at his watch, then rolled down the rear window and peered through the rain at a short street, the rue du Gros Caillou, that intersected the rue Augereau. From this point of observation--and he had twice made sure of it earlier that week--he could see the entry of the Hotel Colbert; a rather subtle entry, only the name in gold letters on the glass door, and a spill of light from the lobby that shone on the wet pavement. A rather subtle hotel, the Colbert, quiet, discreet, that catered to les affaires cinq-a-sept; amours conducted between five and seven, those flexible hours of the early evening. But, Amandola thought, a little taste of fame for you tomorrow. The hotel commissionaire, holding a large umbrella, left the entry and headed briskly down the street, toward the rue Saint-Dominique. Once more, Amandola looked at his watch. 7:32, it said. No, he thought, it is 1932 hours.<br><br> For this occasion, twenty-four-hour time, military time, was obviously the proper form. He was, after all, a major, had taken a commission in 1915, served in the Great War, and had the medals, and seven lavishly tailored uniforms, to prove it. Served with distinction--officially recognized--in the purchasing office of the Ministry of War, in Rome, where he had given orders, maintained discipline, read and signed forms and letters, and made and answered calls on the telephone, his military decorum scrupulous in every way.<br><br> And so it had remained, since 1927, in his tenure as a senior official in the Pubblica Sicurezza, the department of Public Security of the Ministry of the Interior, set up by Mussolini's chief of national police a year earlier. The work was not so different from his job during the war; the forms, the letters, the telephone, and the maintenance of discipline--his staff sat at attention at their desks, and formality was the rule in all discourse.<br><br> 1944 hours. Rain drummed steadily on the roof of the Lancia and Amandola pulled his overcoat tighter, against the chill. Outside on the sidewalk, a maid--under her open raincoat a gray-and-white uniform--was pulled along by a dachshund wearing a sweater. As the dog sniffed at the pavement and began to circle, the maid squinted through the window at Amandola. Rude, the Parisians. He did not bother to turn away, simply looked through her, she did not exist. A few minutes later, a black square-bodied taxi pulled up to the entry of the Colbert. The commissionaire hopped out, leaving the door open, as a couple emerged from the lobby; he white-haired, tall and stooped, she younger, wearing a hat with a veil. They stood together under the commissionaire's umbrella, she raised her veil and they kissed passionately--until next Tuesday, my beloved. Then the woman climbed into the taxi, the man tipped the commissionaire, raised his own umbrella, and strode around the corner.<br><br> 1950 hours. Ecco, Bottini!<br><br> The chauffeur was watching his side-view mirror. "Il galletto," he said. Yes, the cockerel, so they called him, for he did indeed strut. Heading along the rue Augereau toward the Colbert, he was the classical short man who refused to be short: posture erect, back stiff, chin high, chest out. Bottini was a Turinese lawyer who had emigrated to Paris in 1935, dissatisfied with the fascist policies of his native country. A dissatisfaction no doubt sharpened by a good public beating and a half a bottle of castor oil, administered by a Blackshirt action squad as a crowd gathered and gawked in silence. Always a liberal, probably a socialist, possibly a secret Communist, Amandola suspected--slippery as eels, these types--Bottini was a friend to the oppressed, and prominent in the friends-to-the-oppressed community.<br><br> But the problem with il galletto wasn't that he strutted, the problem was that he crowed. Arriving in Paris, he had naturally joined the Giustizia e Liberta--justice and liberty--organization, the largest and most determined group of the antifascist opposition, and then become editor of one of their clandestine newspapers, Liberazione, written in Paris, smuggled into Italy, then printed and covertly distributed. Infamita! This paper kicked like a mule; barbed, witty, knowing, and savage, with not a wisp of respect for Italy's glorious fascismo or Il Duce or any of his achievements. But now, Amandola thought, this galletto was done crowing.<br><br> As Bottini turned the corner of the rue Augereau, he took off his steel-framed eyeglasses, wiped the rain from the lenses with a large white handkerchief, and put the glasses in a case. Then he entered the hotel. He was precisely on schedule, according to the surveillance reports. On Tuesday evenings, from eight to ten, always in Room 44, he would entertain his mistress, the wife of the French socialist politician LaCroix. LaCroix, who had headed one ministry, then another, in the Popular Front government. LaCroix, who stood beside the Prime Minister, Daladier, in the newspaper photographs. LaCroix, who dined at his club every Tuesday and played bridge until midnight.<br><br> It was 2015 before a taxi pulled up to the Colbert and Madame LaCroix emerged, and ran with tiny steps into the hotel. Amandola got only a glimpse of her--brick red hair, pointy white nose, a Rubenesque woman, fleshy and abundant. And greatly appetitious, according to the operatives who'd rented Room 46 and eavesdropped on the other side of the wall. Subjects are vocal, and noisy, said one report. Describing, Amandola supposed, every sort of moan and squeal as the two went at their coupling like excited swine. Oh, he knew her sort; she liked her food and she liked her wine and she liked her naked pleasures--any and all of them no doubt, the full deck of naughty playing cards. Libertines. A full-length mirror faced the foot of the large bed in Room 44 and surely they took advantage of it, thrilled to watch themselves thrashing about, thrilled to watch--everything.<br><br> Now, Amandola thought, one must wait.<br><br> They had learned it was the lovers' custom to spend a few minutes in conversation before they got busy. So, give them a little time. Amandola's OVRA operatives--OVRA was the name of the secret police, the political police, established by Mussolini in the 1920s--were already inside the hotel, had taken rooms that afternoon, accompanied by prostitutes. Who might well, in time, be found by the police and interrogated, but what could they say? He was bald, he wore a beard, he said his name was Mario. But bald Mario and bearded Mario would be, at that point, long gone across the border, back in Italy. At most, the girls would get their pictures in the newspaper.<br><br> Madame LaCroix, when the OVRA men burst into the room, would no doubt be indignant, this was, she would assume, some vile trick perpetrated by her serpent of a husband. But she would not assume it for long, and when the revolver appeared, with its long snout of a silencer, it would be too late to scream. Would Bottini? Or would he plead for his life? No, Amandola thought, he would do neither. He would curse them, a vain galletto to the end, and take his medicine. In the temple. Then, the silencer unscrewed, the revolver placed in Bottini's hand. So sad, so dreary, a doomed love affair, a lover's despair.<br><br> And would the world believe it? The tryst that ended in tragedy? Most would, but some wouldn't, and it was for them that this event had been staged, the ones who would know immediately that this was politics, not passion. Because this was not a quiet disappearance, this was public, and flamboyant, so meant to serve as a warning: We will do anything we want to do, you cannot stop us. The French would be outraged, but then, the French were habitually outraged. Well, let them sputter.<br><br> It was 2042 when the leader of the OVRA squad left the hotel and crossed to Amandola's side of the rue Augereau. Hands in pockets, head down, he wore a rubber raincoat and a black felt hat, rain dripping off the brim. As he passed the Lancia, he raised his head, revealing a dark, heavy face, a southern face, and made eye contact with Amandola. A brief glance, but sufficient. It's done.<br><br> 4 December, 1938. The Cafe Europa, in a narrow street near the Gare du Nord, was owned by a Frenchman of Italian descent. A man of fervent and heated opinions, an idealist, he made his back room available to a group of Parisian giellisti, so-called for their membership in the Giustizia e Liberta--known informally by the initials GL, thus giellisti. There were eight of them that morning, called to an emergency meeting. They all wore dark overcoats, sitting around a table in the unlit room, and, except for the one woman, they wore their hats. Because the room was cold and damp, and also, though nobody ever said it out loud, because it was somehow in keeping with the conspiratorial nature of their politics: the antifascist resistance, the Resistenza.<br><br> They were all more or less in midlife, emigres from Italy, and members of a certain class--a lawyer from Rome, a medical school professor from Venice, an art historian from Siena, a man who had owned a pharmacy in the same city, the woman formerly an industrial chemist in Milan. And so on--several with eyeglasses, most of them smoking cigarettes, except for the Sienese professor of art history, lately employed as a meter reader for the gas company, who smoked a powerful little cigar.<br><br> Three of them had brought along a certain morning newspaper, the very vilest and most outrageous of the Parisian tabloids, and a copy lay on the table, folded open to a grainy photograph beneath the headline MURDER/SUICIDE AT LOVERS HOTEL. Bottini, bare-chested, sat propped against a headboard, a sheet pulled up to his waist, eyes open and unseeing, blood on his face. By his side, a shape beneath the sheet, its arms flung wide.<br><br> The leader of the group, Arturo Salamone, let the newspaper lie open for a time, a silent eulogy. Then, with a sigh, he flipped it closed, folded it in half, and put it by the side of his chair. Salamone was a great bear of a man, with heavy jowls, and thick eyebrows that met at the bridge of his nose. He had been a shipping agent in Genoa, now worked as a bookkeeper at an insurance company. "So then," he said. "Do we accept this?"<br><br> "I do not," said the lawyer. "Staged."<br><br> "Do we agree?"<br><br> The pharmacist cleared his throat and said, "Are we completely sure? That this was, assassination?"<br><br> "I am," Salamone said. "Bottini had no such brutality in him. They killed him, and his lover--the OVRA, or someone like them. This was ordered by Rome; it was planned, prepared, and executed. And not only did they murder Bottini, they defamed him: 'this is the sort of man, unstable, vicious, who speaks against our noble fascism.' And, of course, there are people who will believe it."<br><br> "Some will, always, anything," the woman chemist said. "But we shall see what the Italian papers say about it."<br><br> "They will have to follow the government line," the Venetian professor said.<br><br> The woman shrugged. "As usual. Still, we have a few friends there, and a simple word or two, alleged or supposedly, can cast a shadow. Nobody just reads the news these days, they decipher it, like a code."<br><br> "Then how do we counter?" the lawyer said. "Not an eye for an eye."<br><br> "No," Salamone said. "We are not them. Not yet."<br><br> "We must expose it," the woman said. "The true story, in Liberazione. And hope the clandestine press, here and in Italy, will follow us. We can't let these people get away with what they've done, we can't let them think they got away with it. And we should say where this monstrosity came from."<br><br> "Where is that?" the lawyer said.<br><br> She pointed upward. "The top."<br><br> The lawyer nodded. "Yes, you're right. Perhaps it could be done as an obituary, in a box outlined in black, a political obituary. It should be strong, very strong--here is a man, a hero, who died for what he believed in, a man who told truths the government could not bear to have revealed."<br><br> "Will you write it?" Salamone said.<br><br> "I will do a draft," the lawyer said. "Then we'll see."<br><br> The professor from Siena said, "Maybe you could end by writing that when Mussolini and his friends are swept away, we will pull down his fucking statue on a horse and raise one to honor Bottini."<br><br> The lawyer took pen and pad from his pocket and made a note.<br><br> "What about the family?" the pharmacist said. "Bottini's family."<br><br> "I will talk to his wife," Salamone said. "And we have a fund, we must help as best we can."</p><h2>Nursery Rhyme Time: There Was an Old Lady Who Swallowed a Fly-Read and Chant Along to this Classic Nursery Song with a Modern Twist-Ages 12-36 Months</h2><p><p>Read and sing along to this classic nursery song paired with quirky, colorful illustrations on every page.

They have stronger immune systems. They're better at fighting cancer and surviving famine, and even see the world in a wider variety of colors. They are simply stronger than men at every stage of life. Why is this? And why are we taught the opposite?</p><p>To find out, Dr. Sharon Moalem drew on his own medical experiences - treating premature babies in the neonatal intensive care unit; recruiting the elderly for neurogenetic studies; tending to HIV-positive orphans in Thailand - and tried to understand why in every instance men were consistently less likely to thrive.

He also calls for a reconsideration of our male-centric, one-size-fits-all view of medical studies and even how we prescribe medications - a view that still sees women through the lens of men.</p><p>Revolutionary and yet utterly convincing, The Better Half will make you see humanity and the survival of our species anew.</p></p><p><p><b>Sharon Moalem</b>, MD, PhD, is an award-winning scientist, physician, and New York Times&#x2013;bestselling author.

Each book in this superlative five-volume set illuminates-through a representative sampling of masterworks- the themes, styles, and currents that give shape and direction to a significant period in the history of Western music. <br><br>This first volume in Richard Taruskin's majestic history, Music from the Earliest Notations to the Sixteenth Century , sweeps across centuries of musical innovation to shed light on the early forces that shaped the development of the Western classical tradition. Beginning with the invention of musical notation more than a thousand years ago, Taruskin addresses topics such as the legend of Saint Gregory and Gregorian chant, Augustine's and Boethius's thoughts on music, the liturgical dramas of Hildegard of Bingen, the growth of the music printing business, the literary revolution and the English madrigal, the influence of the Reformation and the Counter-Reformation, and the operas of Monteverdi. Laced with brilliant observations, memorable musical analysis, and a panoramic sense of the interactions between history, culture, politics, art, literature, religion, and music, this book will be essential reading for anyone who wishes to understand this rich and diverse period.<br></p><p><br>Richard Taruskin is professor of musicology at the University of California, Berkeley. In addition to this work, Taruskin is also the author of such books as Music in the Western World: A History in Documents (1985) , Text &amp; Act (OUP, 1995), and Stravinsky and the Russian Traditions (1996).

In Kim Rosen&#x2019;s book, the answer is a resounding "Yes!" Poetry, the most ancient form of prayer, is a necessary medicine for our times: a companion through difficulty; a guide when we are lost; a salve when we are wounded; and a conduit to an inner source of joy, freedom, and insight. Whether you are a lover of poetry or have yet to discover its power, Rosen offers a new way to experience a poem. She encourages you to feel the poem as you might an affirmation or sacred text, which can align every level of your being. In an uncertain world, Saved by a Poem is an emphatic call to cultivate the ever-renewable resources of the heart. Through poetry, the unspeakable can be spoken, the unendurable endured, and the miraculous shared. Weaving teaching, story, verse, and memoir, Rosen guides you to find a poem that speaks to you so you can take it into your life and become a voice for its wisdom in the world.</p><p>Kim Rosen, MFA, is a spoken-word artist, a teacher of self-inquiry, and an award-winning poet. She has given poetry concerts, lectures, and workshops in venues from cathedrals to juvenile lockdown facilities. She has been on the faculty of Wisdom University, the Omega Institute, and Kripalu. Website: www.kimrosen.net"Saved by a Poem is, quite simply, transformational. A book that I now keep by my bedside. I have never before appreciated the power of poetry having been talked out of it in school. Kim Rosen redeemed poetry for me. And a whole new world has opened up.

Through these carefully selected works and a thought-provoking text, the author guides students toward an imaginative new way of looking at art.<br><br>This book is suited both for family reading and for sharing with a small group. Each full-color reproduction is accompanied by a brief biological sketch of the artist and a series of open-ended questions designed to make the most of a child's natural curiosity.</p><p>The &#34;Come Look with Me&#34; series was created by Gladys S. Blizzard, whose experiences as an art teacher and work as a curator of education at Bayly Art Museum at the University of Virginia served as the basis for this educational style.This is a wonderful book that will enrich any adult or child. Many children's books have lovely illustrations, but this one uses colorful and well-reproduced landscapes created by famous artists on one page, along with brief texts about the artist and picture on the next.

As Dr. Keller home schooled her three children, she was unable to find science textbooks that she felt would give her children a solid foundation in the sciences. Her scientific background, coupled with her desire to educate her children, led Dr. Keller to found Gravitas Publications, Inc. and to develop the Real Science-4-Kids curriculum. Real Science-4-Kids is a &#x201c;worldview-neutral&#x201d; curriculum that provides students with a solid foundation in the sciences and also gives them the tools to evaluate scientific data on their own. Students are presented with up-to-date scientific facts and the steps of the scientific method, together with the critical thinking tools needed to help them evaluate scientific conclusions. Dr. Keller&#x2019;s books are as philosophically neutral as possible and do not impose any single overall philosophical interpretation such as Darwinism, Intelligent Design, or Creationism.

Through photographs of the couple's personal effects -- the usual auction items (jewelry, fine art, and rare furniture) and the seemingly worthless (pajamas, Post-it notes, worn paperbacks) -- the story of a failed love affair vividly (and cleverly) emerges. From first meeting to final separation, the progress and rituals of intimacy are revealed through the couple's accumulated relics and memorabilia.

In 1774, elite Virginians suspended trade with Britain in order to pressure Parliament and, at the same time, to save restive Virginia debtors from a terrible recession. The boycott and the growing imperial conflict led to rebellions by enslaved Virginians, Indians, and tobacco farmers. By the spring of 1776 the gentry believed the only way to regain control of the common people was to take Virginia out of the British Empire.<br><br><i>Forced Founders</i> uses the new social history to shed light on a classic political question: why did the owners of vast plantations, viewed by many of their contemporaries as aristocrats, start a revolution? As Holton's fast-paced narrative unfolds, the old story of patriot versus loyalist becomes decidedly more complex.<br><br></p><p>"A challenging reconstruction of the trajectory which carried Virginia's gentlemen revolutionaries from resistance to independence.

Soon after graduating from McGill University, he published his first collection of poems, <i>Let Us Compare Mythologies</i>, in 1956. He would go on to publish a dozen more volumes of poetry, including <i>Book of Longing</i>, and two novels, <i>The Favourite Game </i>and <i>Beautiful </i><i>Losers</i>. A hugely influential and critically acclaimed singer and songwriter, Cohen released fourteen studio albums between 1967 and 2016, the last being <i>You Want It Darker</i>, for the title track of which he posthumously won the Grammy for Best Rock Performance. He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2008 and the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2010, and was honored with a Lifetime Achievement Award at the 2010 Grammys. He won both the Prince of Asturias Award for Literature and the Glenn Gould Prize in 2011, and the first PEN New England Song Lyrics of Literary Excellence Award in 2012. Cohen died in Los Angeles on November 7, 2016.<p>"If you felt Leonard Cohen&#x2019;s death in 2016 as a personal assault, this book is a posthumous balm . . . All of Cohen&#x2019;s work has a raw, straight-to-the-heart intensity&#x2015;reach for this the next time you need inspiration for a wedding toast that will leave them gutted, or any other moment you need a little sustenance for the soul." --<b>Chloe Schama, <i>Vogue</i></b> </p><p>"Cohen's final volume shows his poetic soul. If you know the man only because of &#x201c;Hallelujah&#x201d; or &#x201c;Suzanne,&#x201d; pick up <i>The Flame</i> and warm yourself within its pages." --<b>Bethanne Patrick, <i>The Washington Post</i></b></p><p>"It&#x2019;s clear that Cohen remained sharp until the very end, and the book, a kind of farewell tribute by the poet-prophet, offers ample evidence of his abiding sense of humor . . . Though he claimed not to know the origins of his poetry nor to be able to locate his mission, what Cohen offered his many fans and followers was the opportunity to partake of the kind of spiritual experience that makes it possible for us to feel, if only for a moment, that we are not alone." &#x2015;<b>Shoshana Olidort, <i>Los Angeles Review of Books</i></b></p><p>"[A] grand book . . . elegant . . . Leonard Cohen does not use language to pose, startle or to reinvent. Words are his old comrades, and see him through to the end." --<b>Kate Kellaway, <i>The Observer</i> (U.K.)</b></p><p><i>"</i>In <i>The Flame</i>, an aging artist struggles with questions of death and legacy &#x2015; and tries not to take them too seriously, true to his claim never to do so . . . If [this is] how long it takes to say &#x2018;so long&#x2019; to someone beautiful, we&#x2019;ll be listening to Cohen &#x2015; still smirking and smiling &#x2015; for decades to come, with this collection as our companion." <b>--Hannah Niemeier, <i>The Spectator </i>(U.K.)</b></p><p>"Poignant and brave, lit up with flashes of anger, this is a luminous collection and classic Cohen." &#x2015;<b><i>Booklist </i>(starred)</b></p><p>"Cohen was a poet before he was a musician, and with this posthumous collection his career completes its circle." --<b><i>Financial Times</i> (Best Books of 2018)</b></p><p>"Steeped in somber reckoning, <i>The Flame</i> takes the long view that only age affords . . . Sprinkled with Cohen&#x2019;s self-portrait sketches, <i>The Flame</i> is full of gestures so intimate it&#x2019;s almost a voyeuristic experience . . . The work feels both like a final speech and a disrobing. In perusing the sizeable volume, one can&#x2019;t help but feel privy to something raw and shining, both uncomfortably and movingly revealing, the final laying-bare of a unique chronicler of the human heart." &#x2015;<b><i>BookPage</i></b></p><p>"<i>The Flame </i>is Cohen's last gift to us . . .Cohen&#x2019;s radical honesty and wit became more refined and purified with each passing year . . .He magicked and mastered us after all, getting us to clamor for the bitter pill of his tender, scathing, suffering, beatific vision." --<b>Pamela Erens, <i>Virginia Quarterly Review</i></b> </p><p>"Authentic and revelatory in ways that final novels and poetry collections are not." --<b>Charles Foran, <i>The Walrus </i>(Canada)</b></p><p>"<i>The Flame</i> provides fascinating insight into Cohen&#x2019;s unique talent . . . The entire collection is an intricate exploration of the happenings of the human heart, infused with Cohen&#x2019;s signature themes of longing, love and loss . . . <i>The Flame</i> shows the great power of words to endure long after the person who has written them has passed away, and to offer relief from suffering and elevate the spirits &#x2013; not only for the writer, but for the reader and listener, too." <b>--Anita Sethi, <i>iNews</i> (U.K.)</b></p><p>"A kaleidoscopic archive, a mix-tape of emotions that reveals Cohen&#x2019;s fears and vulnerability with an unusually raw candour. After 10 books of poetry and two novels, it reminds us that the music man who taught the world to scale the chords of <i>Hallelujah</i> still considered writing his first and ultimate vocation . . . it seems Leonard Cohen has left enough words and music for us to carry on without him." <b>--Brian D. Johnson, <i>Macleans</i> (Canada)</b></p><p>"Leonard Cohen offers in <i>The Flame</i> a collection of writing that stands proudly at the end of his body of work . . . Cohen&#x2019;s poems emerge in <i>The Flame</i> as compelling, mingling all the different mentioned themes with a sense of urgency that lurks just beyond their lightness and somewhat self-deprecating humour. It&#x2019;s a balance that Cohen has always navigated well, that between seriousness and playfulness, intensity and lightness. His person seeps through the lines and results from these contrasts as incredibly humble, intelligent, and ever surprising . . . <i>The Flame</i> is a work of moving intimacy, a touching final offering of a writer who was devoted to his art until the very end." &#x2015;<b>Elisa Sabbadin, <i>Pendora </i>(Canada)</b></p></p><h2>Introduction to Robotics: Mechanics and Control</h2><p><p> <i>For senior-year undergraduate and first-year graduate courses in robotics.</i> </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p> <b>An intuitive introduction to robotic theory and application</b> </p> <p>Since its original publication in 1986, Craig&#x2019;s <b> <i>Introduction to Robotics: Mechanics and Control</i> </b> has been the leading textbook for teaching robotics at the university level.

Its 3,000-year history encompasses every conceivable form of garment and decorative linen, from peasant blouses to papal vestments and the bridal gowns of queens; it appears in many guises as the favored embroidery of needleworkers from Denmark to South Africa, from England to the Philippines.<br>Unfortunately, white work has frequently been neglected in the United States because of its underserved reputation as a difficult form of embroidery &#x2014; the type of work that, as author Carter Houck states, is never seen "beyond the glass cases of a museum." In reality white work can be performed at all levels of expertise; even more important, Ms. Houck shows that superb results can be achieved without laborious practice and prodigious technique. From these pages white work emerges as a vibrant and continually evolving form of contemporary embroidery that is both beautiful in itself and valuable for its myriad uses.<br>Ms. Houck assumes no previous knowledge of white work and provides complete information on materials, pattern-transferring techniques, and instructions and diagrams for over 20 stitches: the simple chain stitch and running stitch; satin stitches and French knots; and more difficult "virtuoso" techniques like the Star and Shadow.<br>Following the instructions are 40 pages of magnificent patterns, including florals, repeats, abstract designs, spot and corner decorations in a wide variety of sizes and moods, and two complete sets of alphabets for use as monograms. For each design Ms. Houck has suggested a stitch or stitches that produce optimal effects. As a result, the book acts as a self-contained guide to white work that can transform blouses, cuffs, collars, scarves, place settings, curtains, or any embroidery medium into treasures of heirloom quality.<br></p><p></p></p><p></p><h2>The Revenge of Seven (Lorien Legacies, 5)</h2><p><p><strong>The fifth book of the #1 <em>New York Times</em> bestselling I Am Number Four series! </strong></p><p>The Garde have suffered an unbearable loss.

Her first book of poems, <i>Satan Says</i> (1980), received the inaugural San Francisco Poetry Center Award. Her second, <i>The Dead and the Living</i>, was both the Lamont Poetry Selection for 1983 and winner of the National Book Critics Circle Award. She teaches poetry workshops in the Graduate Creative Writing Program at New York University and in the N.Y.U. workshop program at Goldwater Hospital on Roosevelt Island in New York. More recently she was awarded the Walt Whitman Citation for Merit by the New York State Writers Institute of the State University of New York. The citation officially invested her with the title of New York State Poet for 1998-2000.Beneath the surface of life Olds discovers "what all of us want never to know"her own sexuality. Her obsessive descriptions of sex are too candid to be erotic: "the condom/ripped and the seed tore into me like a/ flame." With evocative imagery ("We think about bones twisted like white/ saplings"), Olds searches through "all the eloquence of the body" for the means to assess her roles as daughter, lover, wife, mother, and woman. Despite a too-easy solipsism ("I looked at you and I tell you I knew you were God/ and I was God"), the best poetry occurs when Olds presents moments of awakening as though they had just happenedher baby's arms "bent like a crab's rosy legs, the/ thighs closely-packed plums in heavy syrup." For poet and reader such moments are purifying.

In what can be termed lyrical theology, <em>Jesus for President</em> poetically weaves together words and images to sing (rather than dictate) its message. It is a collaboration of Shane Claiborne's writing and stories, Chris Haw's reflections and research, and Chico Fajardo-Heflin's art and design. Drawing upon the work of biblical theologians, the lessons of church history, and the examples of modern-day saints and ordinary radicals, <em>Jesus for President</em> stirs the imagination of what the Church could look like if it placed its faith in Jesus instead of Caesar. A fresh look at Christianity and empire, <em>Jesus for President</em> transcends questions of "Should I vote or not?" and "Which candidate?" by thinking creatively about the fundamental issues of faith and allegiance. It's written for those who seek to follow Jesus, rediscover the spirit of the early church, and incarnate the kingdom of God.</p></p><p><p>Shane Claiborne is an activist, author of <em>Jesus for President</em>, coauthor of <em>Common Prayer</em>, and is a founder of The Simple Way, a community in inner-city Philadelphia that has helped birth and connect radical faith communities around the world.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;www.thesimpleway.org</p><br><br>Chris Haw, an aspiring potter, carpenter, painter, and theologian, lives in Camden, NJ, with his wife, Cassie, and his fellow community members.Starred Review. Here is the must-read election-year book for Christian Americans. What should Christians do when allegiances to the state clash with personal faith? Haw and Claiborne (<i>The Irresistible Revolution</i>) slice through politics as usual and well past the superficial layers of the culture wars with their lucid exploration of how Christians can and should relate to presidents and kings, empire and government. Their entertaining yet provocative tour of the Bible's social and economic order makes even the most abstruse Levitical laws come alive for our era. They also provide a valuable political context for Christ's life, reminding readers that Jesus did not preach the need to put God back into government&#x2014;he urged his followers to live by a different set of rules altogether, to hold themselves apart as peculiar people. The compelling writing is enhanced by a lavish, eye-popping layout. The pages are a riot of textured callouts, colors, photos and fonts&#x2014;the perfect packaging for a message that must compete in a world of sound bites. With this second book, Claiborne emerges as an affable, intelligent, humorous prophet of his generation, calling people out of business-as-usual in a corrupt world and back to the radically different social order of the biblical God<i>.

Although most people think that headaches are a normal and inevitable result of stress, headaches need not be the norm for you. I have a number of quick treatment options that have made most of my patients' stress-related headaches disappear fast&#x2014;and they can do the same for you.<br><br>Using the simple techniques in this book, you will be able to take control and relieve headaches once you feel their symptoms coming on. There's no need to wait thirty minutes for an over-the-counter medication to kick in when you can get Instant Relief without any medication at all.<br><br>My techniques work because they are based on an understanding of the way stress affects the muscles that support the head, causing mechanical headaches. When you're under stress, you tend to tighten the muscles in the neck, skull, and face. These tight muscles can cause both vascular compression and nerve compression. Vascular compression means that blood vessels are being squeezed and can't deliver adequate oxygen to cells. Nerve compression results in less-than-optimum electrical-impulse delivery to muscles and inhibits muscular function.<br><br>Emotional stress, however, is not the only reason for mechanical headaches. The tight muscles that lead to so-called "mechanical headaches" also occur when you spend too long a time in a posture that forces your head out of what we call its neutral position. In the neutral position the head sits directly atop the neck in an alignment of relaxed verticality, which follows the gentle S shape of the entire spine with its curves at the neck, upper back, and lower back. If it remains in this position, the head will be well supported by all the vertebrae immediately below it&#x2014;the vertebrae of the neck (the cervical spine) and the upper back (the thoracic spine), as well as the lumbar and sacral vertebrae&#x2014;and also by the muscles and ligaments that connect to these vertebrae. The head needs all the support it can get, because it weighs between ten and twelve pounds&#x2014;the weight of a bowling ball.<br><br>Unfortunately, your head is likely to spend much of its time without adequate support, because you put it into postures that take it out of neutral. If you spend a lot of time on the phone, for example, with your head tilted to hold the phone between your ear and your shoulder ("phone hugging"), you're forcing your head out of neutral position. If you spend a lot of time with your head in a protruded position, with the ears far forward of the shoulders&#x2014;a position assumed by millions of people every day as they stare at their computer screens or bend over their paperwork&#x2014;the head doesn't get the support it needs. Any posture that takes your head out of neutral position for an extended period of time has the potential to cause a headache because of the muscle tightening that results, and the vascular and nerve compression that result from muscle tightening.<br><br>There's another kind of nerve compression that can also result in a headache. Several of the twelve cranial nerves, which originate in the brain and are responsible for many functions, including the special senses of sight, hearing, smelling, and taste, pass through small openings at the base of the skull. If those nerves get compressed because of deviations in the head's normal position, they too can cause headaches.<br><br>Relieving your headache, however, may not be as simple as returning your head to its neutral position. If the head has remained in a protruded position for an extended period of time, bringing it back to neutral can stretch tight tissues, which leads to that common achiness in the back of the head, or above the ear or the eye on one side of the head. Even the scalp can become tense and cause discomfort. That's why I've provided a Brill exercise called a Scalp Glide (Exercise 7), which releases scalp tension.<br><br>Headaches are not the only problem to result from poor alignment. It can potentially cause long-term damage, too, because when the head spends much of its time in a protruded position, you are creating a situation that is like adding a hundred pounds of force on the vertebrae that support the head. This force compresses the disks between the vertebrae of the lower neck, causing particular wear and tear on the topmost vertebra (the atlas). If you don't balance these distortions of the head's natural alignment with movements in the opposite direction, you may experience early degeneration of the spine. Doing the Brill exercises will help prevent long-term damage.<br><br>The major focus of the Brill exercises, however, is on immediate pain relief. Most of the exercises I suggest for headaches emphasize sustaining a position that stretches the muscles of the upper neck and balances the out-of-neutral postures in which we spend so much of our time. By relieving compression in the upper neck, they help restore maximum blood flow and nerve function, which I've found to be the most effective way to relieve headaches quickly. But sometimes that kind of stretching doesn't work, and you're more likely to get relief if you tighten the already-tight muscles even more, holding your head in the extreme protruded position until the muscles finally relax. (See Exercise 12, Prone Neck Protrusion/Retraction, which does both.) It seems illogical, but it can be quite effective.<br><br>So try the Brill exercises, and see which ones work best for you. Don't let a headache overtake you&#x2014;knock it out fast, and get on with your life.<br><i><br>Instant Relief for a Tension Headache</i><b><br><br></b>If, like so many millions of people, you clench your teeth or scowl when you're under stress, you probably get tension headaches, and you may feel pain or tightness in your jaw as well.<br><br>Here are several fast exercises that can relax the clenching and scowling motion and can be done whether you are sitting, standing, or lying down. Other exercises in this chapter work directly on the muscles of the eyes, the scalp, and the sinuses, another source of headache.<br><br>3. Tongue Press<br><br>The jaw, which works like a hinge, is able to open and close thanks to the muscles of the jaw. These muscles attach to the sides of the upper vertebrae in the neck, which are located just behind the ears. When those muscles become imbalanced&#x2014;from sleeping on one side or from an altered bite, which could be caused by a broken crown, an unevenly filled tooth, teeth grinding, or even nail biting&#x2014;you'll feel the impact in your jaw.<br><br>This nifty movement helps the jaw muscles by employing the tongue as a spring to align the hinges of the jaw so that they open and close normally, thus retraining the muscles to work symmetrically.<br><br>* Sit or stand up straight with your head facing forward, or lie on your back with your face toward the ceiling.<br><br>* Relax your jaw and mouth.<br><br>* Push the tip of your tongue against the roof of your mouth behind your upper teeth.<br><br>* Open and close your mouth, with your tongue against the roof of your mouth, ten times.<br><br>4. Ear Tug<br><br>You might find it hard to believe, but this movement eases a tense jaw by elongating tissues that tend to get tight and tense where the ear meets the neck. From the back of the neck to the front, this "tug" relaxes muscles. It also relieves pressure in the inner ear caused by grinding teeth or clenching a jaw. If your ears feel "full" when you fly, doing this tug will decompress the pressure in your ears.<br><br>* Sit or stand up straight with your head facing forward, or lie on your back with your face toward the ceiling.<br><br>* Grasp your earlobes with your index fingers just inside the ears and your thumbs just behind.<br><br>* Gently pull your ears down and out, and hold them for a count of ten.<br><br>5. Cheek Release<br><br>If you grind your teeth or are prone to sinus headaches or jaw tension, doing this movement will relax the buccinator muscles, the sucking muscles in your cheeks, which keep the food between your teeth as you chew. As you do it, you may be reminded of that "face" you made behind someone's back when you were in school. But now you can put it to more practical use.<br><br>* Sit or stand up straight with your head facing forward, or lie on your back with your face toward the ceiling.<br><br>* Place your index fingers inside your cheeks.<br><br>* Gently pull your cheeks outward without straining your lips, and take a deep breath. Slowly exhale as you silently count to ten.<br><br>6. Tongue Loop<br><br>If your voice cracks and lowers when you get nervous, try this exercise, which rebalances the muscles attached to the tongue, as well as the muscles in the front of the neck that support the tongue and therefore affect how you speak.<br><br>When you do this Brill exercise the first time, you might find that it's easier to do in one direction. That is a sure sign that the length and strength of the muscles on either side of the neck and the tongue are out of balance.<br><br>* Sit or stand up straight with your head facing forward, or lie on your back with your face toward the ceiling.<br><br>* Stick out your tongue.<br><br>* Rotate your tongue slowly around your lips five times in one direction and then five times in the other direction.<br><br>7. Scalp Glide<br><br>Here's a way to release tension in the connective tissue between muscles in the front and back of your scalp. When you frown, muscles in the back of your scalp tense. Doing this gliding motion stretches the muscles that extend from the forehead up into the scalp as well as those that extend from the back of the head up into the scalp.<br><br>* Sit or stand up straight with your head facing forward, or lie on your back with your face toward the ceiling.<br><br>* Place your palms at the top of your forehead with fingers touching the scalp on either side.<br><br>* Glide the flesh of your scalp back and forth over your skull with your hands. Repeat ten times.<br><br>8. Forehead Roll<br><br>Not only will this movement relieve a tension headache, it's also great for easing eyestrain, draining clogged sinuses, and relieving forehead tension. If you spend long hours doing paperwork or logging in computer time, this one is for you.<br><br>* Sit or stand up straight with your head facing forward, or lie on your back with your face toward the ceiling.<br><br>* Place the index and middle fingers of both hands an inch above your eyebrows.<br><br>* Roll the skin under your fingers inward for a count of five.<br><br>* Roll the skin under your fingers outward for a count of five.<br><br><b>Eyestrain Relievers<br><br></b>To understand why you may be feeling eyestrain, think of your retinas as screens and your eye muscles as the focus mechanisms. The muscles are responsible for coordinating eye functions so that your vision can move from object to object.<br><br>But when you read for long periods of time with your eyes cast downward, for instance, you shorten and tighten certain eye muscles. Or if you have to look to one side to view your computer screen or protrude your neck in an attempt to get closer to it, these positions will weaken other eye muscles. That's why I always recommend setting up a computer where the screen is directly in front of you, an arm's length away. Placing papers on a slanted surface instead of flat in front of you will also help to balance eye muscles&#x2014;while having the additional virtue of encouraging good posture.<br><br>In the meantime, if you've been attempting to read the fine print in tax forms, straining to look at your computer screen, or sitting through a one-day airing of a twelve-part TV series, try these eyestrain relievers. They will rebalance the five eye muscles you use to bring images to the retina efficiently.<br><br>9. Eye Calisthenics (Straight)<br><br>* Sit or stand up straight with your head facing forward, or lie on your back with your face toward the ceiling.<br><br>* Roll your eyes up until you feel a slight ache in your eyes. Hold that position for a second or two. Then release your eyes to their normal position.<br><br>* Repeat the upward gaze and release five times.<br><br>* Close your eyes for the count of five.<br><br>10. Eye Calisthenics (Diagonal)<br><br>* Sit or stand up straight with your head facing forward, or lie on your back with your face toward the ceiling.<br><br>* Look to the upper right and then to the lower left five times.<br><br>* Look to the upper left and then to the lower right five times.<br><br>* Put your hands together and rub them quickly until warm.<br><br>*Close your eyes, and place your warmed hands over them.<br><br>* Pull your eyes back into your head. (You'll feel them retract in their sockets.)<br><br>* Hold the position for a count of ten to let the eye muscles recover.<br><br>11. Sinus Drainer<br><br>Congested sinuses hurt, and they may make your head hurt, too. There are many different reasons why your four sinuses may become congested with mucus. The common cold is one culprit. Pollutants, irritants, pollen, dust mites, pet dander, mold, and mildew are other possible causes. To help your sinuses drain, try alternating five-minute applications of hot and cold compresses. Drinking hot water with lemon also helps to break up congestion. Avoid dairy foods and sugar, as they promote the formation of mucus.<br><br>If you suffer from sinus pain that worsens when you're under stress, try this:<br><br>* Sit or stand up straight with your head facing forward, or lie on your back with your face toward the ceiling.<br><br>* Place the index and middle fingers of each hand under your eyes and gently make circles toward the nose ten times.<br><br>12. Prone Neck Protrusion/Retraction<br><br>* Lie on your stomach, propped up on your elbows. (I like to call this the "cartoon" position, because that's how kids often watch TV.)<br><br>* Wrap your hands around your face with your wrists touching under your chin and your fingers resting on your cheeks.<br><br>* Take a deep breath.<br><br>* Hyperextend your head forward (protrusion phase) and hold for the count of ten. Exhale.<br><br>* Take a deep breath.<br><br>* Bring your head back with your chin tucked down (retraction phase), and hold for a count of ten. Exhale.<br><br>If your headache dissipates in response to this Brill exercise but doesn't vanish completely, hold the position in which you found relief for sixty seconds.<br><br><i>Chapter Two<br><br>Your Neck</i><b><br><br></b>If stress strikes you in the neck, you have lots of company. That's probably why the expression "a pain in the neck" is part of our everyday language. If your neck is often so tight and tense that you can't turn or bend or lift your head without wincing, this section is specifically for you. But before giving you the Brill exercises for the neck, I have several commonsense do's and don'ts that will help. First, stop slouching. If you're in pain, sitting and standing straight can go a long way toward relieving the strain you're putting on your neck. Also, take frequent stretch breaks, especially if you put in long hours reading or working at the computer. And if you've been rotating your head in a full circular motion in order to relieve the pain, don't do it! This motion tends to compress the neck vertebrae, which will pinch nerves and irritate your neck even more. As for neck rubs, they offer only short-lived relief, if any. You need something more lasting.</p><h2>The Fall of the House of FIFA: The Multimillion-Dollar Corruption at the Heart of Global Soccer</h2><p>In 2015, FIFA-the multibillion dollar governing body of the world's most-loved sport-was brought down by allegations of industrial-scale bribes, kickbacks, money laundering, racketeering and tax evasion. Beginning with early morning raids in Zurich and the indictment of twenty-seven executives by the US Department of Justice, the rottenness at the core of FIFA seemed to extend throughout all of soccer, from the decision to send the 2018 and 2022 World Cups to Russia and Qatar to lesser known cases of embezzlement from Trinidad to South Africa. <br> David Conn writes the definitive account of FIFA's rise and fall, covering in great detail the corruption allegations and the series of scandals that continued to shake the public's trust in the organization. <i>The Fall of the House of FIFA</i> situates FIFA's unraveling amidst revealing human portraits of soccer legends such as Michel Platini and Franz Beckenbauer and features an exclusive interview with former president Sepp Blatter. Even as he chronicles the biggest sport scandal of all time, Conn infuses the book with a passionate love of the game, delivering an irresistible read.</p><p><b>David Conn</b> is the author of <i>The Beautiful Game</i> and an award-winning journalist for the <i>Guardian</i> where he has been a key part of the coverage of the FIFA crisis."[Conn's] study of Sepp Blatter and other football officials is full of startling material and has cumulative power."&#x2015;<b><i><em>The Guardian</em></i></b><br><br>"Conn left no stone unturned, skillfully re-creating a time line of the corruption that threatened the very integrity of the game. His meticulous research and smooth writing style bring this unseemly chapter in FIFA history to a close, with realistic hope for the future of the most popular sport on earth....This is the conclusive account of the recent international FIFA scandal. As we look ahead to the 2018 World Cup, this is also a timely reminder that money and power are always a threat to high ideals in sports."&#x2015;<b><i><strong><em>Library Journal</em></strong></i></b><br><br>"When an award-winning journalist like David Conn speaks, you listen.

From his audacious attempt to corner the gold market in 1869 to his battle for control of the geographically crucial Erie Railroad, Fisk was a flamboyant exemplar of a new financial era marked by volatile fortunes and unprecedented greed and corruption.

Smoke from the coal fires that heat the homes and shops along the narrow streets swirls upward to join the fog that congeals intermittently into drizzle. This part of Paris hides the signs of the Great Depression better than the blighted industrial districts, but the tattered storefronts, the shabby dress of men with nowhere to go, and the age of the few cars that ply the streets betray a community struggling to keep its soul together.<br><br>An old, oddly configured vehicle lumbers slowly along the cobbles. The dispirited pedestrians pay it no mind. Nor do they heed the two women and one man who walk behind it. The women appear to be locals; the shawls around their shoulders and the scarves on their heads could have been taken from the woman selling apples on one of the corners they pass or from the grandmother dividing a thin baguette among her four little ones. (Or could she be their mother? Hard times play evil tricks on youth and beauty.)<br><br>The man must be a foreigner. He dresses like an En?glishman, one whom the Depression seems to have spared. His heavy wool coat and felt hat shield him from the damp; the coat's collar and the hat's brim hide his face from those around him. He might be an American; he walks more assertively than the average En?glishman. He probably walked still more assertively when he was younger, although how many years have passed since that sprightly era is impossible to say.<br><br>The two women speak quietly to each other. Neither addresses the man, nor he them. The vehicle-whether it is a car or a truck is as much a puzzle as most else about this small procession-slows almost to a stop, then turns onto the leaf-strewn lane of the cemetery that these days forms a principal raison d'ï¿½tre of the neighborhood. It moves tentatively along the track, picking its way among the gravestones and mausoleums, beneath the connecting branches of trees left over from when the farm on this site began accepting plantings that didn't sprout, not in this existence. The driver finally locates what he has been looking for, and he stops beside a fresh pile of dirt that is gradually turning dark as the drizzle soaks in. Two men shrouded in long coats suddenly but silently appear, as if from the earth itself. They stand at the rear of the vehicle as the driver lowers the gate. They grasp handles on the sides of the bare wooden box the vehicle contains, and with a nonchalance just shy of disrespect they hoist it out and set it on the ground between the pile of dirt and the hole from which the dirt has come.<br><br>They step aside, wordlessly letting the three mourners know that this is their last chance to commune with the deceased. One of the women produces, from a cloth bag, a small cluster of chrysanthemums and places it on the coffin. The man takes a rose from inside his coat and, with quiet tenderness, lays it beside the other flowers.<br><br>The three step back and gaze down at the wooden box. The drizzle turns to rain. The gravediggers slip short loops of rope inside the handles and lower the coffin into the grave. They pull up the ropes and begin shoveling the dirt back into its hole.<br><br>The hearse drives away, at a faster pace than before. The women walk off together. The man lingers. He looks at the grave, then at the city in the distance, then back at the grave. Finally he too departs.<br><br>2<br><br>Another day, another decade, another funeral. And such a funeral. Lifelong New Yorkers cannot remember larger crowds, even to mark the Union victory in the Civil War. Many of those present today attended the victory celebration, but it is the nature of life in the great city, and the strength of the city's appeal to outsiders, that a large part of the population has turned over in the seven years since the Confederate surrender at Appomattox. Today the newcomers crane to see what the fuss is about.<br><br>The funeral begins at the Grand Opera House on Twenty-third Street, where the body has lain for viewing. No one thinks the choice of venue odd-or at least none thinks it odder than that the Opera House is also home to one of America's great railroads, the Erie, of which the deceased was a director and to which he, as owner of the Opera House, rented office space. The lavish interior of the house-the sweeping grand staircase, the twenty-foot mahogany doors embellished with the company initials "E. R.," the bronze horses pawing the air furiously with their forehooves, the two-story mirror with the bust of Shakespeare on top, the sumptuous wall hangings, the carved and gilt columns, the cherubs disporting about the ceiling, the fountains spewing water into the air-has been rendered somewhat more somber for the sad occasion by the addition of black muslin tied up with black and white satin rosettes, to cover the cherubs and hide the gilt.<br><br>The visitors have been gathering since dawn; by eleven, when the doors open, they number ten thousand. They file slowly in, some entering by the door on the Twenty-third Street side, the others from Eighth Avenue. They approach the rosewood casket with its gold-plated handles. They see the deceased in his uniform as colonel of New York's Ninth Regiment of militia. His cap and sword rest on his chest; his strawberry curls grace his forehead and temples. His face appears composed, albeit understandably pale; to some this seems strange, given the circumstances of the death. Flowers of various kinds- tuberoses, camellias, lilies-cover the lower portion of the body and surround the casket. Their scent fills the gallery. An honor guard of the Ninth Regiment stands at attention.<br><br>First to view the body are the other directors of the Erie Railroad and certain members of the New York bar and judiciary. When the general public is let in, several women professionally associated with the opera-of which the deceased was a prominent patron-burst into tears. His barber stops at the head of the casket and, with one hand, rearranges the curls while, with the other, he twists the tips of the dead man's moustache.<br><br>As the last of the visitors depart, the funeral service commences. The chaplain of the regiment reads from the Episcopal prayer book. The wife, mother, and sister of the deceased, all veiled and dressed in black, sit quietly for the most part, only now and then airing a sigh or an audible sob. At the end of the reading, each of the women approaches the casket and kisses the dead man. The rank and file of the regiment march slowly past their fallen comrade and commander, paying silent tribute.<br><br>The casket is closed and covered with an American flag. The honor guard carries the casket to a waiting hearse. The regiment's band, backed by musicians from one of New York's German associations, tolls a dirge.<br><br>The funeral procession forms up. One hundred New York policemen take the lead, followed by the band, which has segued into "The Dead March in Saul." A contingent of employees of the Erie Railroad come next, un- uniformed except for the black crape that adorns their arms. The full regiment, in parade dress, marches in triple file behind the Erie men. The hearse, pulled by four caparisoned black horses, rolls at a stately pace. A Negro groomsman guides the colonel's favorite horse, a snorting black charger. The saddle is empty; reversed boots fill the stirrups. Officers of New York's other regiments trail the stallion. Distinguished civilians, in handsome carriages, bring up the rear.<br><br>The procession moves slowly east on Twenty-third Street. Businesses have closed out of respect for the dead man's passing; curtains and shades have been drawn on the private residences. Onlookers pack the sidewalks and spill into the streets. Others stand in the doorways and open windows of the buildings and on every balcony<br><br>and stoop. Most are respectfully silent, but children shout and strangers who don't know why the city has come to a midday halt insistently ask. More than a few of those familiar with the irreverence of the deceased talk and laugh in a different form of respect.<br><br>The procession turns north at Fifth Avenue. The regiment corners smartly, the others at their whim. Two blocks bring them to the New Haven depot, where a locomotive and train stand waiting. The pallbearers transfer the casket to a special car, draped in black, attached to the rear of the train. The family and close friends climb aboard the car to accompany their loved one to his final resting place in his native Vermont.<br><br>The locomotive puts on steam and slowly pulls the train out of the station. No one departs until the train has gone. "And thus passed from sight the mortal remains of one who might have been a vast power for good, had he made use of the glorious opportunities vouchsafed to him," an eyewitness, more knowledgeable and literary than most, remarks. "Doubtless he had noble qualities, but they were hidden from the eyes of men, while his vices seemed to be on every man's lips."<br><br>3<br><br>Yet another day, another decade, another spectacle. Of course, every day with Jim Fisk is a spectacle. Or so Josie Mansfield often observes.<br><br>Josie knows as much about Fisk as anyone does, and more than most people do. She knows he comes from Vermont, where he mastered the arts of persuasion while peddling tools and trinkets to the closed-fisted farmers of the Green Mountain State, whose wives loved Fisk for bringing the civilized world to their doorsteps and whose children thought of him as Santa Claus.<br><br>She knows that he moved from Vermont to Boston in search of wealthier customers and fatter profits, and from Boston to New York for the same reason, amplified. She knows-or at least has heard-how he made a fortune smuggling Southern cotton to Northern mills during the Civil War.<br><br>She knows he loves a spectacle, and that the spectacles he loves best put him at center stage. He perfumes his hair and waxes his moustache; he wears velvet coats of peacock colors, tailored low in front to reveal the diamond studs in his silk shirts. More diamonds, much larger, adorn his fingers and sparkle when he twirls the fat cigars he employs to punctuate his florid sentences.<br><br>Josie knows Fisk runs with a fast crowd on Wall Street. He is Dan Drew's protï¿½gï¿½ and Jay Gould's partner; the three speculators have joined forces to fight the formidable Cornelius Vanderbilt for control of the Erie Railroad. Drew's domed forehead and beetled brow hide secrets of market manipulation vouchsafed to few in the financial world; his starched collar and tight cravat cover a heart that can merely be presumed to exist. Many on Wall Street swear Drew invented the double cross; more reliable authorities make him the pioneer of stock watering, which he is said to have adapted from the days when, as a cattle drover, he herded beeves down Broadway and swelled their bellies with water before unloading them on naï¿½ve purchasers. Now he simply dilutes the value of corporate stock by issuing new, sometimes bogus shares. The Erie is Drew's special plaything, his favored vehicle for manipulation. Josie can recite the Wall Street triplet: "Daniel says up, Erie goes up / Daniel says down, Erie goes down / Daniel says wiggle-waggle, it bobs both ways." Yet Drew combines conscienceless weekday practice with weekend piety; he never misses Sunday service at the Fourth Street Meth?odist Church and is endowing a divinity school to propagate the Gospel and bolster the Golden Rule- to repair the damage he does it during the week, Drew watchers suggest.<br><br>She knows less about Jay Gould, in part because Gould cultivates mystery. He hides his comparative youth-he is not quite thirty-two- behind a bushy black beard and in public defers to Drew and Fisk. But his dark eyes flash when speculation is afoot, and his unconscious habit of tearing paper to shreds while reckoning risks and rewards tells Josie, whose biography has taught her to read men, that he might be the one to watch out for.<br><br>Cornelius Vanderbilt is the titan of Wall Street-full of ambition, even at seventy-three years of age; full of money, as the wealthiest man in America; full of himself, with flowing white hair and sideburns that suit his imperious manner. He won his fortune by strength of will and often of arm; broken jaws and black eyes among the competition marked his rise to the top of the world of steam transport. He built a fleet of passenger ships and still insists on being called "Commodore"; lately he has diversified into trains. He drives the fanciest coach in Manhattan, pulled by the fastest horses and filled with the prettiest young women. His wrath is legendary and his wealth gives him the power to wield it. "Gentlemen," he famously wrote to a cabal who crossed him, "you have undertaken to cheat me. I won't sue you, for the law is too slow. I'll ruin you." And of course he did.<br><br>He similarly aims to ruin Drew, Fisk, and Gould, who stand between him and control of the Erie Railroad. Josie knows that if Vanderbilt joins the Erie to his New York Central Railroad he will possess a monopoly of freight and passenger traffic between New York City and the Great Lakes and will become even wealthier, more prideful, and more powerful than he already is. The city and much of the Eastern Seaboard will be in his grasp; millions will pay whatever charges he deigns to dictate. If he fails to gain the Erie, he will gnash his teeth in the frustration he always feels at being bested and likely will launch a counterattack that could rock the railroad industry to its roots. With the economy as a whole coming to depend on railroads-these days hardly anything or anyone moves more than a few miles without riding a train- the fate of the country may rest on the outcome of the battle for the Erie.<br><br>Josie and New York watch as the strategies of the two sides unfold in early 1868. Vanderbilt's assault is characteristically frontal: he orders his brokers to buy all the Erie shares they can. Like many frontal assaults, Vanderbilt's attack is expensive: each round of purchases drives up the share price. But Vanderbilt's great wealth almost guarantees success, and he intends to recoup his investment by hiking the Erie's rates and fares after he captures the road.<br><br>Drew's defensive strategy is likewise characteristic, in his case deviously so. Drew currently commands a controlling interest in the Erie, and he has lately added Fisk and Gould to the board of directors, which authorizes the issue of $10 million in bonds convertible to stock. The function of the bonds, Drew tells the board, is to fund improvements to the road; in reality he plans to use them against Vanderbilt. Together with some stock shares authorized by the board but not yet issued, the bonds give Drew potential access to some 100,000 shares that the market-meaning, at this point, primarily Vanderbilt-knows nothing about.<br><br>Vanderbilt's ignorance is crucial to Drew's plan, for the fate of the Erie turns on the question of whether Vanderbilt will run out of money before Drew and his comrades run out of stock. The share price continues to mount as the Commodore presses his purchasing, but Vanderbilt, allowing for the shares known to exist, calculates that he can absorb the rising price and still reach his goal.</p><h2>Syren (Septimus Heap, Book 5)</h2><p><p><strong>The fifth book in the internationally bestselling Septimus Heap series by Angie Sage, featuring the funny and fantastic adventures of a wizard apprentice and his quest to become an ExtraOrdinary Wizard.</strong></p><p><strong><em>New York Times</em> Bestselling Series</strong></p><p><strong>&#x201c;In Sage&#x2019;s most thrilling book yet, a new host of characters appear, giving the complex plot even more sparkle.&#x201d; &#x2014;<em>VOYA</em> (starred review)</strong></p><p><strong>&#x201c;Once again, Sage&#x2019;s tale combines humor, adventure, and inventive storytelling and is sure to please her many fans.&#x201d;</strong><strong>&#x2014;</strong><strong>ALA <em>Booklist</em></strong></p><p><strong>&#x201c;<em>Syren</em> is Sage at her best; it&#x2019;s full of fun, adventure, humor, irony, friendship, loyalty and nonstop action&#x201d; </strong><strong>&#x2014;</strong><strong><em>School Library Journal</em></strong></p><p>In this epic Magykal installment, Septimus ends up on a captivatingly beautiful island, one of seven set in a sparkling sea.

After their marriage she spent several months living on the plantation. Profoundly shocked by what she saw, she recorded her observations of plantation life in a series of journal entries written as letters to a friend.

Thus the religious method is overturned by Christ: in Christianity it is no longer the person who seeks to know the mystery but the mystery that makes himself known by entering history. At the Origin of the Christian Claim presents an intriguing argument supported with ample documentation from the gospels and other theological writings.</p><p>CAText: English (translation)<br> Original Language: Italian</p><h2>The Source: How Rivers Made America and America Remade Its Rivers</h2><p><p><strong>An Amazon Best Book of the Year</strong></p><p><strong>How rivers have shaped American politics, economics, and society from the beginnings of the Republic to today.</strong></p><p>America has more than 250,000 rivers, coursing over more than 3 million miles, connecting the disparate regions of the United States. On a map they can look like the veins, arteries, and capillaries of a continent-wide circulatory system, and in a way they are. Over the course of this nation&#x2019;s history rivers have served as integral trade routes, borders, passageways, sewers, and sinks. Over the years, based on our shifting needs and values, we have harnessed their power with waterwheels and dams, straightened them for ships, drained them with irrigation canals, set them on fire, and even attempted to restore them.</p><p>In this fresh and powerful work of environmental history, Martin Doyle tells the epic story of America and its rivers, from the U.S. Constitution&#x2019;s roots in interstate river navigation, the origins of the Army Corps of Engineers, the discovery of gold in 1848, and the construction of the Hoover Dam and the TVA during the New Deal, to the failure of the levees in Hurricane Katrina and the water wars in the west. Along the way, he explores how rivers have often been the source of arguments at the heart of the American experiment&#x2015;over federalism, sovereignty and property rights, taxation, regulation, conservation, and development.</p><p>Through his encounters with experts all over the country&#x2015;a Mississippi River tugboat captain, an Erie Canal lock operator, a dendrochronologist who can predict the future based on the story trees tell about the past, a western rancher fighting for water rights&#x2015;Doyle reveals the central role rivers have played in American history&#x2015;and how vital they are to its future.</p> 20 illustrations</p><p><strong>Martin Doyle</strong> is director of the Water Policy Program at the Nicholas Institute for Environmental Policy Solutions and a professor of river science and policy at Duke University&#x2019;s Nicholas School of the Environment.

Alarmed by Bismarck&#39;s territorial ambitions and the Prussian army&#39;s crushing defeats of Denmark in 1864 and Austria in 1866, French Emperor Napoleon III vowed to bring Prussia to heel. Digging into many European and American archives for the first time, Geoffrey Wawro&#39;s Franco-Prussian War describes the war that followed in thrilling detail. While the armies mobilized in July 1870, the conflict appeared &#34;too close to call.&#34; Prussia and its German allies had twice as many troops as the French. But Marshal Achille Bazaine&#39;s grognards (&#34;old grumblers&#34;) were the stuff of legend, the most resourceful, battle-hardened, sharp-shooting troops in Europe, and they carried the best rifle in the world. From the political intrigues that began and ended the war to the bloody battles at Gravelotte and Sedan and the last murderous fights on the Loire and in Paris, this is the definitive history of the Franco-Prussian War. Dr. Geoffrey Wawro is Professor of Strategic Studies at the U.S. Naval War College in Newport, Rhode Island. Wawro has published two books: The Austro-Prussian War (Cambridge, 1996) and Warfare and Society in Europe, 1792-1914 (Routledge, 2000). He has published articles in The Journal of Military History, War in History, The International History Review, The Naval War College Review, American Scholar, and the European History Quarterly, and op-eds in the Los Angeles Times, New York Post, Miami Herald, Hartford Courant, and Providence Journal. Wawro has won several academic prizes including the Austrian Cultural Institute Prize and the Society for Military History Moncado Prize for Excellence in the Writing of Military History. He has lectured widely on military innovation and international security in Europe, the U.S., and Canada and is host of the History Channel program Hardcover History--a weekly book show with leading historians, pundits, critics, statesmen and journalists.</p><p>The Franco-Prussian War of 1870-71 violently changed the course of European History.

The sky`s darkness was pushed away, an unwelcome guest on this the first night of the Gedderone Fete. Throngs filled the streets of Darujhistan, happily riotous, good- natured in the calamity of one year`s ending and another`s beginning. The night air was humid and pungent with countless scents. There had been banquets. There had been unveilings of eligible young men and maidens. Tables laden with exotic foods, ladies wrapped in silks, men and women in preposterous uniforms all glittering gilt - a city with no standing army bred a plethora of private militias and a chaotic proliferation of high ranks held, more or less exclusively, by the nobility. Among the celebrations she had attended this evening, on the arm of her husband, she had not once seen a real officer of Darujhistan`s City Watch, not one genuine soldier with a dusty cloak- hem, with polished boots bearing scars, with a sword- grip of plain leather and a pommel gouged and burnished by wear. Yet she had seen, bound high on soft, well- fed arms, torcs in the manner of decorated soldiers among the Malazan army - soldiers from an empire that had, not so long ago, provided for Darujhistan mothers chilling threats to belligerent children. <em>`Malazans, child! Skulking in the night to steal foolish children! To make you slaves for their terrible Empress - yes! Here in this very city!` But the torcs she had seen this night were not the plain bronze or faintly etched silver of genuine Malazan decorations and signi.ers of rank, such as appeared like relics from some long- dead cult in the city`s market stalls. No, these had been gold, studded with gems, the blue of sapphire being the commonest hue even among the coloured glass, blue like the blue .re for which the city was famous, blue to proclaim some great and brave service to Darujhistan itself. Her fingers had pressed upon one such torc, there on her husband`s arm, although there was real muscle beneath it, a hardness to match the contemptuous look in his eyes as he surveyed the clusters of nobility in the vast humming hall, with the proprietary air he had acquired since attaining the Council. The contempt had been there long before and if anything had grown since his latest and most triumphant victory. Daru gestures of congratulation and respect had swirled round them in their stately passage through the crowds, and with each acknowledgement her husband`s face had grown yet harder, the arm beneath her fingers drawing ever tauter, the knuckles of his hands whitening above his sword- belt where the thumbs were tucked into braided loops in the latest fashion among duellists. Oh, he revelled in being among them now; indeed, in being above many of them. But for Gorlas Vidikas, this did not mean he had to like any of them. The more they fawned, the deeper his contempt, and that he would have been offended without their obsequy was a contradiction, she suspected, that a man like her husband was not wont to entertain. The nobles had eaten and drunk, and stood and posed and wandered and paraded and danced themselves into swift exhaustion, and now the banquet halls and staterooms echoed with naught but the desultory ministrations of servants. Beyond the high walls of the estates, however, the common folk rollicked still in the streets. Masked and half naked, they danced on the cobbles - the riotous whirling steps of the Flaying of Fander - as if dawn would never come, as if the hazy moon itself would stand motionless in the abyss in astonished witness to their revelry. City Watch patrols simply stood back and observed, drawing dusty cloaks about their bodies, gauntlets rustling as they rested hands on truncheons and swords. On the balcony where she stood, the fountain of the unlit garden directly below chirped and gurgled to itself, buffered by the estate`s high, solid walls from the raucous festivities they had witnessed during the tortured carriage ride back home. Smeared moonlight struggled in the softly swirling pool surrounding the fountain. The blue fire was too strong this night, too strong even for the mournful moon. Darujhistan itself was a sapphire, blazing in the torc of the world. And yet its beauty, and all its delighted pride and its multitudinous voice, could not reach her tonight. This night, Lady Vidikas had seen her future. Each and every year of it. There on her husband`s hard arm. And the moon, well, it looked like a thing of the past, a memory dimmed by time, yet it had taken her back. To a balcony much like this one in a time that now seemed very long ago. Lady Vidikas, who had once been Challice Estraysian, had just seen her future. And was discovering, here in this night and standing against this rail, that the past was a better place to be. Talk about the worst night yet to run out of Rhivi flatbread. Swearing under her breath, Picker pushed her way through the crowds of the Lakefront market, the mobs of ferociously hungry, drunk revellers, using her elbows when she needed to and glowering at every delirious smile swung her way, and came out eventually at the mouth of a dingy alley heaped ankle- deep in rubbish. Somewhere just to the south of Borthen Park. Not quite the route back to the bar she would have preferred, but the fete was in full frenzy. Wrapped package of flatbread tucked under her left arm, she paused to tug loose the tangles of her heavy cloak, scowled on seeing a fresh stain from a careless passer- by - some grotesque Gadrobi sweetcake - tried wiping it off which only made it worse, then, her mood even fouler, set out through the detritus. With the Lady`s pull, Bluepearl and Antsy had fared better in finding Saltoan wine and were even now back at K`rul`s. And here she was, twelve streets and two wall passages away with twenty or thirty thousand mad fools in between. Would her companions wait for her? Not a chance. Damn Blend and her addiction to Rhivi flatbread! That and her sprained ankle had conspired to force Picker out here on the first night of the fete - if that ankle truly <em>was sprained, and she had her doubts since Mallet had just squinted down at the offending appendage, then shrugged. Mind you, that was about as much as anyone had come to expect from Mallet. He`d been miserable since the retirement, and the chance of the sun`s rising any time in the healer`s future was about as likely as Hood`s forgetting to tally the count. And it wasn`t as if he was alone in his misery, was it? But where was the value in feeding her ill temper with all these well- chewed thoughts? Well, it made her feel better, that`s what. Dester Thrin, wrapped tight in black cloak and hood, watched the big- arsed woman kicking her way through the rubbish at the other end of the alley. He`d picked her up coming out of the back door of K`rul`s Bar, the culmination of four nights positioned in the carefully chosen, darkness- shrouded vantage point from which he could observe that narrow postern. His clan- master had warned that the targets were all ex- soldiers, but Dester Thrin had seen little to suggest that any of them had kept .t and trim. They were old, sagging, rarely sober, and this one, well, she wore that huge, thick woollen cloak because she was getting heavy and it clearly made her self- conscious. Following her through the crowds had been relatively easy - she was a head taller than the average Gadrobi, and the route she took to this decrepit Rhivi market in Lakefront seemed to deliberately avoid the Daru streets, some strange affectation that would, in a very short time, prove fatal. Dester`s own Daru blood had permitted him a clear view of his target, pushing purposefully through the heaving press of celebrants. He set out to traverse the alley once his target exited at the</em></em></p></p><h2>Arguing Religion: A Bishop Speaks at Facebook and Google</h2><p>Every day, millions of people fight about religion.

M. Meerloo has studied the methods by which systematic mental pressure brings people to abject submission, and by which totalitarians imprint their subjective &#34;truth&#34; on their victims&#39; minds. The first two and one-half years of World War II, Dr. Meerloo spent under the pressure of Nazi-occupied Holland, witnessing at firsthand the Nazi methods of mental torture .on more than one occasion. During this time he was able to use his psychiatric and psychoanalytic knowledge to treat some of the victims. Then, after personal experiences with enforced interrogation, he escaped from a Nazi prison and certain death to England, where he was able, as Chief of the Psychological Department of the Netherlands Forces, to observe and study coercive methods officially. In this capacity he had to investigate not only traitors and collaborators, but also those members of the Resistance who had gone through the utmost of mental pressure. Later, as High Commissioner for Welfare, he came in closer contact with those who had gone through physical and mental torture. After the war, he came to the United States, where his war experiences would not permit him to concentrate solely on his psychiatric practice, but compelled him to go beyond purely medical aspects to the social aspects of the problem. As more and more cases of thought control, brainwashing, and mental coercion were disclosed - Cardinal Mindszenty, Colonel Schwable, Robert Vogeler, and others - his interest grew. It was Dr. Meerloo who coined the word menticide, the killing of the spirit, for this peculiar crime. His knowledge of these totalitarian procedures has been officially acknowledged; he served as an expert witness in the case of Colonel Schwable, the Marine Corps officer who, after months of subjection to physical and mental torture following his capture in Korea, was made to confess to having taken part in germ warfare. It is Dr. Meerloo&#39;s position that through pressure on the weak points in men&#39;s makeup, totalitarian methods can turn anyone into a &#34;traitor.&#34; And in The Rape of the Mind he goes far beyond the direct military implications of mental torture to describing how our own culture unobtrusively shows symptoms of pressurizing people&#39;s minds. He presents a systematic analysis of the methods of brainwashing and mental torture and coercion, and shows how totalitarian strategy, with its use of mass psychology, leads to systematized &#34;rape of the mind.&#34; He describes the new age of cold war with its mental terror, verbocracy, and semantic fog, the use of fear as a tool of mass submission and the problem of treason and loyalty, so loaded with dangerous confusion. The Rape of the Mind is written for the interested layman, not only for experts and scientists. Contents: Part One: The Techniques of Individual Submission. 1. You Too Would Confess. 2.

Annie Proulx admits, "I have never before felt possessive about a poet, but I am fiercely glad that Billy Collins is ours." John Updike proclaims his poems "consistently startling, more serious than they seem, they describe all the worlds that are and were and some others besides."<br><br> This special, limited edition celebrates Billy Collins's years as U.S. Poet Laureate. <i>Picnic, Lightning</i>--one of the books that helped establish and secure his reputation and popularity during the 1990s--combines humor and seriousness, wit and sublimity. His poems touch on a wide range of subjects, from jazz to death, from weather to sex, but share common ground where the mind and heart can meet. Whether reading him for the first time or the fiftieth, this collector's edition is a must-have for anyone interested in the poet the <i>New York Times</i> calls simply "the real thing."</p><p>In these playful, conversational poems, Billy Collins immerses us in the minutiae of a life--cow viewing, parsley chopping, "buzzing around on espresso"--and restores a sense of wonder. In a voice half confessional, half avuncular, he takes us by the hand and shares his deepest secrets. Whether shoveling snow with the Buddha, releasing Emily Dickinson from her corsets, spoofing Auden and Wordsworth, or putting words in the mouths of Victoria's Secret models ("So what if I am wearing nothing / but this stretch panne velvet bodysuit ... Do you have a problem with that?!"), Collins is a pure delight. In one of several poems in which jazz figures prominently, he amusingly considers well-known but ne'er-acknowledged facial expressions such as "the languorous droop," "pained concentration," and "existential bemusement." Similarly, in "Marginalia" he caps off a list of scribblings with a pointed request for all to step forward who "have managed to graduate from college / without ever having written 'Man vs. Nature'" in a margin. <p> Though there is plenty to make us laugh, Collins is more than a mere comic genius. On the contrary, he balances the ribald with the poignant, the over-the-top with the serenely beautiful: </p><p> <i>And the soul is up on the roof<br> in her nightdress, straddling the ridge,<br> singing a song about the wildness of the sea<br> until the first rip of pink appears in the sky.<br> Then, they all will return to the sleeping body<br> the way a flock of birds settles back into a tree...</i> </p><p> In the opening poem ("A Portrait of the Reader with a Bowl of Cereal"), Collins defies William Butler Yeats's advice to "never speak directly, / as to someone at the breakfast table." Instead, he promises to "lean forward, / elbows on the table, / with something to tell you." One hundred pages later, we thank him for a promise kept. --Martha Silano</p>Over the past decade, Billy Collins has emerged as the most beloved American poet since Robert Frost, garnering critical acclaim and broad popular appeal. To celebrate his years as U.S. Poet Laureate, The University of Pittsburgh Press is pleased to announce these special limited editions, in hardcover, of the books that helped establish and secure his reputation during the 1990s.

A member of one of the leading Norman families involved in the invasion of Ireland, he first visited there in 1183 and later returned in the entourage of Henry II. The resulting Topographia Hiberniae is an extraordinary account of his travels. Here he describes landscapes, fish, birds and animals; recounts the history of Ireland&#39;s rulers; and tells fantastical stories of magic wells and deadly whirlpools, strange creatures and evil spirits. Written from the point of view of an invader and reformer, this work has been rightly criticized for its portrait of a primitive land, yet it is also one of the most important sources for what is known of Ireland during the Middle Ages.</p><p>Gerald of Wales was born c.1145 in Pembrokeshire.

Even though<br>it was still rush hour, there were few people on the street. The pedestrians<br>huddled beneath umbrellas turned inside out and scrunched their<br>chins into turned-up collars for a little protection from the icy, whipping<br>rain. Everyone who could was driving a car or jammed into the<br>steaming warmth aboard a bus or streetcar.<br><br>An elderly woman pulling a stubborn, soaking-wet dachshund on<br>a leash stood closest. The howls that she and the dog uttered announced<br>to those people in the vicinity that something serious had happened.<br>Hurrying pedestrians slowed their pace. Curiosity got the upper<br>hand, and they were drawn toward the site of the accident.<br><br>A white Mercedes was carelessly parked by the curb. A man in a<br>light-colored overcoat had just rushed around the car and opened the<br>door on the passenger&#x2019;s side when the lady with the dachshund started<br>to scream. The man turned quickly, squinted through the rain, and<br>caught sight of the heap thirty meters away. He kept his grip on the<br>open car door, slowly tilted his head back, and looked up at the top<br>floor of the imposing apartment building. A faint moaning sound rose<br>from his throat, but he remained catatonically still.<br><br>Without putting on her coat, the small woman in the passenger&#x2019;s<br>seat jumped nimbly out of the car and ran over to the motionless figure<br>on the ground. Her slenderness was emphasized by the stylish<br>Chanel dress she was wearing. She had mastered to perfection the art<br>of running in high heels. She elbowed her way through the crowd frenetically<br>and reached the inner circle.<br><br>Chapter One<br><br>THE PATROL CAR WAS the first to arrive on the scene. The ambulance<br>came a scant five minutes later. As far as the ambulance medics<br>could tell, there wasn&#x2019;t much for them to do. The two police officers<br>attempted to hold back the sensation-hungry spectators who suddenly<br>were stoic enough to defy both wind and rain. One of the officers got<br>into the car and called for backup.<br><br>&#x201c;Send the crime scene team to the corner of Aschebergsgatan and<br>Molinsgatan. A guy jumped from the fifth floor. Looks like it&#x2019;s that bigtime<br>businessman, Knï¿½ck-something-or-other. His wife and son are<br>here, in shock. We need another ambulance for them. Oh, I see . . .<br>von Knecht.&#x201d;<br><br>DE T E C T I V E SUPERINTENDENT Sven Andersson had just<br>reached his old Volvo 240 and was putting his key in the lock when<br>he heard a familiar female voice shouting, &#x201c;Sven, wait! Case in<br>progress!&#x201d;<br><br>Annoyed, he turned to her and sighed. &#x201c;What is it now?&#x201d;<br><br>The detective inspector&#x2019;s voice revealed a slight hint of titillation<br>when she said, &#x201c;Richard von Knecht jumped off his balcony!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Richard von Knecht! The Richard von Knecht?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes. It sounds unbelievable. Was there a stock market crash or<br>something?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Hop in the car. Did you get an address?&#x201d;<br><br>THE RAIN was pouring down, and the superintendent had to put his<br>windshield wipers on high to be able to see out. Gï¿½teborg was really<br>living up to its nickname of &#x201c;Soaking-borg.&#x201d; The week before there<br>had been total winter chaos with half a meter of snow; the whole city<br>had been paralyzed for several days. The result would undoubtedly be<br>a high birth rate the next August. Now it was a few degrees above freezing<br>with not a snowflake to be seen.<br><br>DETECTIVE INSPECTOR HUSS 3<br><br>Detective Inspector Irene Huss phoned her teenage daughters and<br>told them that she&#x2019;d be late. They were used to it by now, after her many<br>years with the Crime Police. They promised to take the dog for a walk<br>and feed him, and to let their father know. Krister was no doubt used<br>to it, too. As was usual, he would make a good dinner for his daughters.<br>Everything had been organized to run smoothly in the family, even<br>without her help.<br><br>She must have sighed audibly, because Superintendent Andersson<br>turned to her and asked, &#x201c;Is something bothering you?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No, nothing. It&#x2019;s depressing weather. Depressing, with scattered suicides.<br>Depressing. Depressing!&#x201d;<br><br>The superintendent nodded in agreement and stared gloomily at the<br>black rain being flung against the windshield by the gusty wind. He<br>broke the silence and asked, &#x201c;How could Dispatch be so sure that it<br>was really Richard von Knecht who jumped?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;According to the officer on duty, the wife and son were down on<br>the street. Apparently, it was the son who called the police.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Do you know what floor he fell from?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No, but it seems it was high enough.&#x201d;<br><br>They sat in silence for a few minutes. At last the superintendent<br>cleared his throat and asked, &#x201c;Do you know anything about Richard<br>von Knecht?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What most people know. Aristocratic family, and wealthy.<br>Talented businessman, stock market speculator, and one of Gï¿½teborg&#x2019;s<br>biggest celebrities. According to Aftonbladet&#x2019;s financial section he&#x2019;s a<br>business genius, but my husband says he&#x2019;s just had incredible luck.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Is Krister an expert on business and the stock market now, too?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No. Although he does own twenty shares of Trygg Hansa, which<br>he received as a bonus when they reorganized a few years back. He&#x2019;s<br>still the chef at Glady&#x2019;s Corner.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s supposed to be a great place. Very trendy, I hear.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You bet.&#x201d;<br><br>Through the slapping of the windshield wipers they could now see<br>the flashing blue lights of the emergency vehicles. The crime team was<br>there and had blocked off a large area. The site of the body&#x2019;s impact<br>was illuminated by a soft light streaming from the glass in the front<br>entrance of an exclusive menswear store. The door was set into the corner<br>of the building&#x2019;s granite foundation. Superintendent Andersson had<br>a vague memory that there had been a pharmacy on this spot when<br>he was a boy. But he wasn&#x2019;t quite sure, since he had grown up in<br>4 Helene Tursten<br><br>Masthugget, the neighborhood that was torn down during &#x201c;urban<br>renewal&#x201d; in the sixties.<br><br>Above the door the corner extended into an oriel. There was an oriel<br>on the corner of each floor, whose bay windows faced in three directions,<br>except for the top floor, which sported a balcony crowned by a<br>turreted roof. It was from there that Richard von Knecht had plunged<br>to the street. Superintendent Andersson let his glance pass over the<br>remains, but he quickly looked away. Inspector Huss also shuddered<br>when she saw what von Knecht looked like. It was not a pretty way<br>to die, she thought. One of the crime scene team came over to them.<br>&#x201c;The medical examiner will be here any minute.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Do you know which one is coming?&#x201d; asked the superintendent.<br><br>A shrug was the reply. With Inspector Huss in his wake, Superintendent<br>Andersson walked over to the parked patrol car. He bent<br>down to the officer in the driver&#x2019;s seat.<br><br>&#x201c;Hi, Superintendent Sven Andersson from Homicide.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Hans Stefansson from PO-One. So they&#x2019;ve already called in you<br>guys?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes, it&#x2019;s unusually quick. We were contacted barely fifteen minutes<br>afterward, which would mean that he jumped at five forty-five P.M. Is<br>that right?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No, we were the first on the scene, at five thirty-five on the dot.<br>He must have floated on down max five minutes earlier. My partner<br>and I were on Korsvï¿½gen when the call came in. I would think the correct<br>time of impact would be five-thirty.&#x201d;<br><br>Their conversation was interrupted by the arrival of Medical<br>Examiner Yvonne Stridner. She was a professor of forensic medicine<br>and undeniably one of the country&#x2019;s most talented pathologists. But<br>Superintendent Andersson had a hard time working with her because<br>Professor Stridner was a woman who demonstrated her expertise gladly<br>and saw no reason to hide her light under a bushel. Inspector Huss herself<br>had been involved in several cases in which the hypotheses of the<br>police were turned completely upside down by Yvonne Stridner&#x2019;s definite<br>forensic opinions. And so far she had always been right. But that<br>wasn&#x2019;t it as much as the fact that she was authoritarian and pedantic<br>that made it difficult for Superintendent Andersson to accept her. Huss<br>had a strong hunch that, deep down, the superintendent did not regard<br>forensic medicine as a proper job for a woman.<br><br>The white Ford Escort with MEDICAL EXAMINER painted on both front<br>doors had been parked at the outer perimeter of the blocked-off area.<br><br>DETECTIVE INSPECTOR HUSS 5<br><br>Out sailed the professor of forensic medicine. Even those who had no<br>idea of her profession stood aside in deference to her commanding presence.<br>Her flaming red hair was exquisitely set off by her soft mustardcolored<br>woolen coat. She strode up to the body, took off her coat, and<br>asked an officer to hold it. Underneath she was wearing a clean white<br>lab coat. She opened the little bag she was carrying, pulled on a pair<br>of latex gloves, and squatted down next to von Knecht&#x2019;s remains. The<br>crime scene technicians had just rigged up a floodlight, giving her a<br>better view. She hadn&#x2019;t cast a single glance around her. Professor<br>Stridner was wearing a pair of plastic protectors over her expensive<br>leather shoes. There was a good deal of blood around the body, mixed<br>with a lot of other material and diluted with rainwater. Slushy.<br>In order to feel that she was being of some use, Inspector Huss decided<br>to start questioning the police officers present. The commander of the<br>unit, Hï¿½kan Lund, she knew well. Fifteen years earlier they had both<br>been rookies in what was then the third precinct, today Polisomrï¿½de<br>1, Gï¿½teborg&#x2019;s downtown area. Lund wasn&#x2019;t much taller than she was&#x2014;<br>five-nine at most. But his waistline would soon be approaching his<br>height if he didn&#x2019;t watch out.<br><br>The crime team had received their instructions. Hï¿½kan Lund turned<br>to Irene Huss and said easily, &#x201c;At your service, Huss! Is Violent Crimes<br>already on site?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Hi, how are you doing? Yes, we were called in early this time. When<br>did you get here?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;We got the call from Dispatch just after five-thirty. We were inside<br>the station but left right away. &#x2018;Top priority! Richard von Knecht is<br>lying dead at the corner of Molinsgatan and Aschebergsgatan!&#x2019;&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;How did it look here?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Chaos! The vultures had gathered. We almost couldn&#x2019;t get through<br>the crowd. But we pushed and shoved and got them driven back and<br>set up barriers. We cordoned off a large area, as you can see. A few people<br>did try to get under the crime scene tape, but I yelled right in their<br>faces. Literally!&#x201d;<br><br>Inspector Huss could imagine the scene vividly. Quickly she went<br>on to ask, &#x201c;Who identified Richard von Knecht?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;His wife and son. When we got through the crowd a woman covered<br>in blood was standing here wailing. Some guy was trying to prop<br>her up. That was Fru von Knecht and her son. From what I understood,<br>they happened to be right here on the street when he fell,&#x201d; said Lund<br>sympathetically.<br>6 Helene Tursten<br><br>&#x201c;Where are they now?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;The ambulance took them off to Sahlgren Hospital. But you won&#x2019;t<br>be able to talk to her for a couple of days, and the son was chalk white<br>in the face. He even threw up before they got into the ambulance.&#x201d;<br>Lund looked serious, but suddenly brightened up and exclaimed,<br>&#x201c;Hey, I know someone you&#x2019;ll be interested in meeting. Come on!&#x201d;<br>Irene followed him over toward the crime team&#x2019;s van. With a histrionic<br>gesture he opened up one of the side doors and said, &#x201c;This is Fru<br>Eva Karlsson. Fru Karlsson, this is Detective Inspector Irene Huss.&#x201d;<br>He turned to the little old woman in the light-gray trench coat, who<br>nodded mutely in greeting. On her knees sat a brown dachshund. It<br>clearly did not suffer from muteness. Over the dog&#x2019;s frantic yapping Irene<br>could hear Lund saying, &#x201c;This is the closest witness we have. She was<br>standing about seven meters from the point of impact.&#x201d;<br><br>Irene turned to the woman. A trembling, thin white hand was held<br>out toward her. Cautiously, she took the fragile, ice-cold hand in hers.<br>In a soothing tone of voice she began, &#x201c;Fru Karlsson, I&#x2019;d like to hear<br>a little about the tragic event you were witness to this evening&#x2014;&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Frightful! I&#x2019;m almost seventy-seven years old, and this is the most<br>appalling thing that has ever happened to me in my whole life! To<br>watch a human being smashed right at my feet! He almost fell right<br>on top of Snoopy!&#x201d;<br><br>A thin white finger pointed accusingly at the remains of Richard<br>von Knecht. Irene gave up at once. It would be best to drive the old<br>lady home and try to interview her later.<br><br>Over by the body, Stridner had begun packing up her things. With<br>a practiced motion the professor tore off the rubber gloves, took off her<br>lab coat, and stuffed all of it into her bag. She had already removed<br>the plastic protectors from her feet. Without looking at him, Stridner<br>made a queenly gesture with her arm to the young police sergeant, who<br>had been patiently holding her coat for more than a quarter of an hour.<br>She seemed only now to notice all the people standing around her. She<br>called out, &#x201c;Is there anyone from Violent Crimes here?&#x201d;<br><br>Superintendent Andersson slumped, sighed, and shambled over to her.<br>&#x201c;All right, Andersson. Come and look. Don&#x2019;t step in the blood,&#x201d; said<br>the pathologist.<br><br>Inspector Huss stole after her superintendent. Stridner had taken a<br>pen from the outside pocket of her bag. She pulled briskly on one end<br>and produced a meter-long lecture pointer. It was perfectly in character<br>for Yvonne Stridner to go around with a pointer in her bag. She<br><br>DETECTIVE INSPECTOR HUSS 7<br>said urgently, &#x201c;Look there at the top of the right hand. I&#x2019;ve turned his<br>hand forward so that the light falls on it. Look!&#x201d;<br><br>She gestured with her slender pointer. The two detectives looked.<br><br>Running across the entire back of the hand was a deep groove. It wasn&#x2019;t<br>as incised as a knife wound, but it had clearly been caused by something<br>relatively sharp.<br><br>Andersson ventured to ask, &#x201c;Couldn&#x2019;t he have gotten that from the<br>fall?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No. Too distinct. The wound was inflicted by an instrument or<br>weapon. Since I happen to know . . . knew . . . von Knecht, this death<br>affects me personally. I&#x2019;m actually supposed to be teaching graduate students<br>all morning tomorrow, but I&#x2019;ll see to the autopsy myself. I&#x2019;ll start<br>by eight at the latest and will let you know after eleven.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Isn&#x2019;t there a chance you could take a look at him tonight?&#x201d; Superintendent<br>Andersson gazed at the professor without much hope. She<br>fluffed her red tresses with her fingertips. Her hairdo had been thoroughly<br>soaked while she was doing her preliminary investigation. &#x201c;Not<br>necessary, Andersson,&#x201d; she replied curtly. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s almost certain that this<br>is a homicide.&#x201d;<br><br>Irene Huss stared incredulously at the pathologist. Rage began to<br>rise inside her: being condescended to stimulates the release of adrenaline<br>in most people. She interrupted the conversation acerbically.<br>&#x201c;Wait just a minute! What are you basing this on? And how did you<br>know von Knecht?&#x201d;<br><br>The pathologist gave her a surprised look, as if only now noticing<br>that another person was present. Sven Andersson muttered Irene Huss&#x2019;s<br>name and title in explanation. Before Professor Stridner managed to<br>reply, some ambulance men came over and asked whether it was all<br>right to take the body to Pathology. The ME nodded.

Though until now it has remained mostly anonymous, its members invented the concept of hacktivism, released the top tool for testing password security, and created what was for years the best technique for controlling computers from afar, forcing giant companies to work harder to protect customers. They contributed to the development of Tor, the most important privacy tool on the net, and helped build cyberweapons that advanced US security without injuring anyone. With its origins in the earliest days of the Internet, the cDc is full of oddball characters -- activists, artists, even future politicians. Many of these hackers have become top executives and advisors walking the corridors of power in Washington and Silicon Valley. The most famous is former Texas Congressman and current presidential candidate Beto O'Rourke, whose time in the cDc set him up to found a tech business, launch an alternative publication in El Paso, and make long-shot bets on unconventional campaigns.<br>Today, the group and its followers are battling electoral misinformation, making personal data safer, and battling to keep technology a force for good instead of for surveillance and oppression. <i>Cult of the Dead Cow</i> shows how governments, corporations, and criminals came to hold immense power over individuals and how we can fight back against them.</p><p>An investigative reporter for Reuters, <b>Joseph Menn</b> is the longest serving and most respected mainstream journalist on cyber security.

We left the ground&#x2015;I with Christian mantras and a great sense of destiny, of being at last on my true way after years of waiting and wondering..."</em> With these words, dated October 15. 1968, the late Father Thomas Merton recorded the beginning of his fateful journey to the Orient. His travels led him from Bangkok, through India to Ceylon, and back again to Bangkok for his scheduled talk at a conference of Asian monastic orders. There he unequivocally reaffirmed his Christian vocation. His last journal entry was made on December 8, 1968, two days before his untimely, accidental death. Amply illustrated with photographs he himself took along the way and fully indexed, the book also contains a glossary of Asian religious terms, a preface by the Indian scholar Amiya Chakravarty, a foreword and postscript by Brother Patrick Hart of the Abbey of Gethsemani, as well as several appendices, among them the text of Merton's final address. Black-and-white photographs throughout</p><p>This volume, the journal Merton kept on the journey to Asia where his life ended, also is a culmination of his long spiritual journey as a writer. "His ecumenism was total," the editors remind us, "and we find him ranging from Tantric Buddhism to Zen, and from Islam and Sufism to Vedanta." The book, however, is not dryly academic; rather, as the foreword suggests, "Merton's pilgrimage to Asia was an effort to deepen his own religious and monastic commitment." Merton himself was clear about this sense of pilgrimage; so too was he clear that this meant in no way a break with his Christian roots. "I think we have now reached a stage ... of religious maturity," he writes, "at which it may be possible for someone to remain perfectly faithful to a Christian and Western monastic commitment, and yet to learn in depth from say, a Buddhist discipline and experience." This book is the fruit of such learning. Including descriptions of his meetings with the young Dalai Lama, the book is meticulously edited and supplied with useful explanatory notes and appendices, including transcriptions of talks that Merton gave during his trip. Most movingly, however, the journal itself concludes with the narrative of his transformative experiences in Ceylon where he visited three colossal figures of Buddha carved from huge stones. "Surely," he writes, "my Asian pilgrimage has come clear and purified itself." A few days later he passed away. <i>--Doug Thorpe</i><p><strong>Thomas Merton</strong> (1915-1968) entered the Cistercian Abbey of Gethsemani in Kentucky, following his conversion to Catholicism and was ordained in 1949.

As such, it possesses a volatile chemistry that--as we are made painfully through news reports and television--explodes on a regular basis. Karen Armstrong, a former Roman Catholic nun who teaches Judaism and is an honorary member of the Association of Muslim Social Services, has compiled a thorough narrative of the city&#39;s fascinating 3,000-year history. Though she emphasizes the city&#39;s religious turning points, she recounts battles, earthquakes and various other events, such as invasions by the Romans and the Crusaders, just a millennium apart, that nearly wiped out the city. Her comprehensive explanations provide a context to the current strife in Israel."SPLENDID . . . Eminently sane and patient . . . Essential reading for Jews, Christians, and Muslims alike."<br>--The Washington Post <br>Venerated for millennia by three faiths, torn by irreconcilable conflict, conquered, rebuilt, and mourned for again and again, Jerusalem is a sacred city whose very sacredness has engendered terrible tragedy. In this fascinating volume, Karen Armstrong, author of the highly praised A History of God, traces the history of how Jews, Christians, and Muslims have all laid claim to Jerusalem as their holy place, and how three radically different concepts of holiness have shaped and scarred the city for thousands of years. <br>Armstrong unfolds a complex story of spiritual upheaval and political transformation--from King David's capital to an administrative outpost of the Roman Empire, from the cosmopolitan city sanctified by Christ to the spiritual center conquered and glorified by Muslims, from the gleaming prize of European Crusaders to the bullet-ridden symbol of the present-day Arab-Israeli conflict. <br>Written with grace and clarity, the product of years of meticulous research, Jerusalem combines the pageant of history with the profundity of searching spiritual analysis. Like Karen Armstrong's A History of God, Jerusalem is a book for the ages. <br>"THE BEST SERIOUS, ACCESSIBLE HISTORY OF THE MOST SPIRITUALLY IMPORTANT CITY IN THE WORLD."<br>--The Baltimore Sun <br>"A WORK OF IMPRESSIVE SWEEP AND GRANDEUR."<br>--Los Angeles Times Book Review</p><h2>A Basket of Flowers (Classic Fiction)</h2><p><p> Mary grows up sheltered and secure in a beautiful cottage with a loving father.

Duiker provides startling insights into Ho&#39;s true motivation, as well as into the Soviet and Chinese roles in the Vietnam War.</p><p>Ho Chi Minh (1890-1969) fought for half a century to free Vietnam from foreign domination, and the story of his life illuminates the ongoing struggle between colonialism and nationalism that still shapes world history. William J. Duiker, who served in Saigon's U.S. embassy during the Vietnam War, spent 30 years delving into Vietnamese and European archives, as well as interviewing Minh's surviving colleagues, in order to write this definitive biography. The son of a civil servant from a traditionally rebellious province, the future president of North Vietnam was known for more than 20 years as Nguyen That Thanh. It was under this name that he founded the Vietnamese Communist Party, having concluded after reading Lenin's analysis of imperialism that revolutionary Marxism was the most effective tool to achieve Vietnam's independence. He spent 30 years in exile, cementing his communist ties in Moscow and working with Vietnamese rebels from a base in China, before assuming the name Ho Chi Minh in 1942, when the forces unleashed by World War II seemed to be clearing the way for Vietnamese liberation. French intransigence and American anti-communism would delay the emergence of an independent, united Vietnam for another 30 years, but Ho became an icon who inspired the communist North and the Southern Vietcong to keep fighting. Focusing almost exclusively on political events and ideological debates, Duiker depicts Ho as a nationalist first and foremost, but also as a convinced (though pragmatic) Marxist who believed socialism would help his country modernize and correct ancient inequities. This long, very detailed biography is not for the casual reader, but anyone with a serious interest in modern history will relish a dense narrative that fully conveys the complexities of the man and the issues with which he grappled. <i>--Wendy Smith</i><strong>William J.

Some 75 builders share their knowledge of building and design, with artistic, practical, and/or economical homes in the United States, Canada, England, Scotland, France, Germany, Spain, New Zealand, and Lithuania.</p> <ul> <li>The average American home is 2,500 sq. ft.</li> <li>The tiny home averages 200-300 sq. ft.</li> <li>The small homes here are 400-1200 sq. ft. &#x2015; the middle ground &#x2015; not too big, not too small (<i>ï¿½ la</i> Goldilocks).</li> </ul> <p>Compared to the average American home, small homes are less expensive, use less resources, are more efficient to heat and cool, and cheaper to maintain and repair. Compared to tiny homes, they offer a lot more space and breathing room.</p> They are desirable for people who want to avoid a bank mortgage or high rents, yet need more room than a tiny house affords.<p></p> <p><b>Here are 65 small homes.</b></p> They vary from unique and artistic to simple and low-cost. Some are plain, ordinary buildings that provide owners shelter at a reasonable cost &#x2015; and some are inspiring examples of design, carpentry, craftsmanship, imagination, creativity, and homemaking.<p></p> <p>Some are built with "natural materials," such as cob or straw, some with recycled wood or lumber milled on-site, some are old homes that have been remodeled, and many are designed and built from scratch by the owners. Many are in the country, some in small towns, and some in large cities.</p> <p><b>It&#x2019;s all in the hands.</b></p> <p>The underlying theme with Shelter&#x2019;s books, which cover an over-40-year span, is that you can create your own home with your own hands, using mostly natural materials.</p> <p>And note: A computer can&#x2019;t build your home for you.

As a commission merchant, importer, shipowner, and an active journalist who reported "ship news" and interviewed surviving pirates, Defoe achieved a high degree of authority on the subject of buccaneers. His knowledge was such that his book, <i>A General History of the Pyrates</i>, remains the major source of information about piracy in the first quarter of the 18th century.<br>Reprinted here in its entirety, this fascinating history abounds in tales of flamboyant outlaws and their bloody deeds: Captain Edward Teach, alias Blackbeard; Captain William Kidd, whose trial and execution created a sensation throughout London and the world; Bartholomew Roberts, one of the most successful pirates of the era, whose crews captured an estimated 400 prizes in three years; Mary Read and Anne Bonny, who disguised themselves as men to sail under the Jolly Roger with the ill-fated Captain John Rackham; and many more.<br>An engrossing blend of fact and fiction &#x2014; incorporating Defoe's celebrated flair for journalistic detail &#x2014; these lively tales of seafaring rogues and rascals and their ill-gotten gains will captivate armchair sailors, maritime enthusiasts and any lover of adventure on the high seas. This unique work has been edited by noted scholar Manuel Schonhorn, who has also supplied a provocative Postscript to the Dover Edition offering insights into the vast popularity of this subject in today's theater, movies, TV specials, magazine articles, lavish books, and maritime exhibitions. In an added "Note on the Author and the Text," Professor Schonhorn also examines the arguments for and against Defoe's very authorship of this important book.</p><p></p></p><p>Daniel Defoe (1660-1731), novelist, pamphleteer, journalist, and political spy, is best known for his novels Robinson Crusoe and Moll Flanders.Despite varying titles, these are essentially the same book. Published in 1724, Defoe's chronicle of the scourges of the sea was a smashing success, finding a wide audience eager for tales of those cutthroat sailors who flew the skull and crossbones. The Dover edition is more scholarly, including several essays on Defoe, indexes (ships, names, and places), photos, and a postscript.

Since the early 1990s, when the Jesus quest was reawakened for a third run, numerous significant books have emerged. And the public's attention has been regularly arrested by media coverage, with the Jesus Seminar or the James ossuary headlining the marquee. <em>The Historical Jesus: Five Views</em> provides a venue for readers to sit in on a virtual seminar on the historical Jesus. Beginning with a scene-setting historical introduction by the editors, prominent figures in the Jesus quest set forth their views and respond to their fellow scholars. On the one end Robert M. Price lucidly maintains that the probability of Jesus' existence has reached the "vanishing point," and on the other Darrell Bock ably argues that while critical method yields only a "gist" of Jesus, it takes us in the direction of the Gospel portraits. In between there are numerous avenues to explore, questions to be asked and "assured results" to be weighed. And John Dominic Crossan, Luke Timothy Johnson and James D. G. Dunn probe these issues with formidable knowledge and honed insight, filling out a further range of options. <em>The Historical Jesus: Five Views</em> offers a unique entry into the Jesus quest. For both the classroom and personal study, this is a book that fascinates, probes and engages.</p><p>[combined] <strong>James K.

He is a most agile poet in a precarious world. Life is alarming and absurd, but properly considered that absurdity reveals, often with laughter, the something else by which we live. The poems are about our world, our wrecked, vexed love for it. Tate has been described as a surrealist.

However, as Carrie Gibson explains with great depth and clarity in <i>El Norte</i>, the nation has much older Spanish roots&#x2015;ones that have long been unacknowledged or marginalized. The Hispanic past of the United States predates the arrival of the Pilgrims by a century, and has been every bit as important in shaping the nation as it exists today. <p> <i>El Norte</i> chronicles the sweeping and dramatic history of Hispanic North America from the arrival of the Spanish in the early 16th century to the present&#x2015;from Ponce de Leon&#x2019;s initial landing in Florida in 1513 to Spanish control of the vast Louisiana territory in 1762 to the Mexican-American War in 1846 and up to the more recent tragedy of post-hurricane Puerto Rico and the ongoing border acrimony with Mexico. Interwoven in this stirring narrative of events and people are cultural issues that have been there from the start but which are unresolved to this day: language, belonging, community, race, and nationality. Seeing them play out over centuries provides vital perspective at a time when it is urgently needed. </p><p> In 1883, Walt Whitman meditated on his country&#x2019;s Spanish past: &#x201c;We Americans have yet to really learn our own antecedents, and sort them, to unify them,&#x201d; predicting that &#x201c;to that composite American identity of the future, Spanish character will supply some of the most needed parts.&#x201d; That future is here, and <i>El Norte</i>, a stirring and eventful history in its own right, will make a powerful impact on our national understanding.</p></p><p><b>Carrie Gibson</b> is the author of the acclaimed <i>Empire&#x2019;s Crossroads: A History of the Caribbean From Columbus to the Present Day</i>. She received a PhD from Cambridge University, focusing on the Spanish Caribbean in the era of the Haitian Revolution, and has worked as a journalist for the <i>Guardian</i> and contributed to other publications, as well as the BBC. She has done research across Mexico, the West Indies, and the United States. She lives in London.<b>Praise for <i>El Norte</i>:</b><p>&#x201c;<i>El Norte</i> is the book that Americans, Anglo and Hispanic, should read as an education on their own American place or role . . . This is a serious book of history but also an engaging project of reading the future in the past . . . What is particularly fascinating about this book is that its encyclopedic project is not a rewriting of history but a recitation of readings. Almost each historical event is retold through memory, recording, evaluation, and discussion. This is history as dialogue. It leaves the mourning authority of archives and takes its place as a long conversation, presupposing that truth can be reached through an extended pilgrimage, a journey through violence, discrimination, racism, exploitation, and the inferno created by occupation.&#x201d;<b>&#x2015;Julio Ortega, <i>New York Times Book Review</i></b></p><p>&#x201c;An important correction to centuries of American history . . . Of course no recent public figure has done more to stoke such prejudices than our current president. Gibson&#x2019;s sprawling work makes a major contribution by reminding us of the falseness of Donald Trump&#x2019;s xenophobic narrative. Her rich account leaves no doubt that America is a vastly more interesting place because of the millions of Hispanic immigrants who have been arriving on our shores for more than 600 years.&#x201d;<b>&#x2015;Charles Kaiser, <i>Guardian</i></b></p><p>&#x201c;This history debunks the myth of American exceptionalism by revisiting a past that is not British and Protestant but Hispanic and Catholic. Gibson begins with the arrival of Spaniards in La Florida, in 1513, discusses Mexico&#x2019;s ceding of territory to the U.S., in 1848, and concludes with Trump&#x2019;s nativist fixations. Along the way, she explains how California came to be named after a fictional island in a book by a Castilian Renaissance writer and asks why we ignore a chapter of our history that began long before the Pilgrims arrived. At a time when the building of walls occupies so much attention, Gibson makes a case for the blurring of boundaries.&#x201d;<b>&#x2015;<i>New Yorker</i></b></p><p>&#x201c;[Gibson] writes engagingly of moments of violence and injustice, deprivation and discrimination, music and muses: Her paragraphs on the early-20th-century Texas society women who bickered over how to restore the Alamo, for instance, would do justice to the pen of an Edith Wharton.&#x201d;<b>&#x2015;Felipe Fernï¿½ndez-Armesto, <i>Wall Street Journal</i></b></p><p>&#x201c;A century before the pilgrims landed at Plymouth Rock, the Spanish came to the Americas.

By widening the lens of history and refocusing it on the Spanish roots of North America instead of the traditional focus on the continent after Anglo colonization, <i>El Norte</i> traces an underrepresented history of north America in accessible terms, all while doing some serious narrative-busting.&#x201d;<b>&#x2015;<i>Jezebel</i></b></p><p>&#x201c;Ambitious . . . [Chronicles] 600 years through the lens of Hispanic-infused geography, culture, and governance. In the telling, [Gibson] provides a revealing historical perspective on our current political climate. From today&#x2019;s vantage point, very little of this complex and often bloody saga is admirable or inspiring, Still, Gibson tells it with authoritative gusto . . .

Is one Hispanic if one does not speak Spanish or Portuguese, or does ethnicity extend beyond the borders of language? . . . Gibson soundly concludes that the history of the Spanish &#x2018;is central to how the United States has developed and will continue to develop,&#x2019; lending further utility to her work.

Davis, author of <i>The Gulf: The Making of an American Sea</i>, winner of the 2018 Pulitzer Prize for History</b></p><p> &#x201c;Carrie Gibson has written an epic history which will significantly change the way we look at American history, from the Georgia in which she grew up to the California coast. She chronicles the way in which Hispanic people&#x2015;Spanish, Mexican, Cuban and Puerto Rican&#x2015;shaped places like the American South and Southwest in a way not captured by our standard narrative, which inaccurately relies overly on British colonization and America&#x2019;s westward expansion. In so doing, she challenges and dispels the stereotypes of the &#x2018;Black Legend,&#x2019; which has cast Hispanics as villains in the American story, either cruel or incompetent or both. Along the way, she takes the readers on Spanish travels to the Chesapeake and Canada as well as settlements that stand to this day, from New Madrid, Missouri to Mesilla, New Mexico and Tampa. Her research is meticulous in detail and her writing propels the reader through 500 years to transport them to today.&#x201d;<b>&#x2015;Richard Parker, author of <i>Lone Star Nation: How Texas Will Transform America</i></b> </p><p> &#x201c;A sweeping story of our Hispanic roots that links the dreamers of the Conquest with the Dreamers of the present, ranging across a continent&#x2019;s history from first contacts in Florida to intersecting empires on Vancouver Island.

The arrival of his spirited grandmother and the absence of his meddlesome mother&#x2014;who is currently running a book club in a Bedouin harem (don&#x2019;t ask)&#x2014;bring unforeseen blessings: no psychotherapy, no Italian lessons, and no yoga classes. Meanwhile, surprises await Scotland Street&#x2019;s grown-ups. Matthew makes a discovery that could be a major windfall for his family, but also presents a worrisome dilemma. Pat learns a secret about her father&#x2019;s fiancï¿½e that may shake up her family, unless she can convince the perpetually narcissistic Bruce to help her out. And the Duke of Johannesburg finds himself in sudden need of an explanation&#x2014;and an escape route&#x2014;when accosted by a determined guest at a soirï¿½e. From the cunning schemes of the Association of Scottish Nudists to the myriad expressive possibilities of the word &#x201c;aye,&#x201d; Alexander McCall Smith guides us through the risks and rewards of friendship, love, and family with his usual inimitable wit and irresistible charm.</p><p>Alexander McCall Smith is the author of the No. 1 Ladies&#x2019; Detective Agency series, the Isabel Dalhousie series, the Portuguese Irregular Verbs series, the 44 Scotland Street series, and the Corduroy Mansions series. He is professor emeritus of medical law at the University of Edinburgh in Scotland and has served with many national and international organizations concerned with bioethics.1. Moving Can Be Good For You<br><br>Matthew had read somewhere&#x2014;in one of those hoary lists with which newspapers and magazines fill their columns on quiet days&#x2014;that moving house was one of the most stressful of life&#x2019;s experiences&#x2014;even if not quite as disturbing as being the victim of an armed robbery or being elected president, nemine contradicente, of an unstable South American republic. Matthew faced no such threats, of course, but he nevertheless found the prospect of leaving India Street for the sylvan surroundings of Nine Mile Burn extremely worrying. And it made no difference that Nine Mile Burn was, as the name suggested, only nine miles from the centre of Edinburgh.<br><br>&#x201c;What really worries me,&#x201d; he confessed to Elspeth, &#x201c;is the whole business of selling India Street. What if nobody wants to buy this flat? What then?&#x201d;<br><br>He looked at her with unconcealed anxiety: he could imagine what it was like not to be able to sell one&#x2019;s house. He had recently been at a party at which somebody had whispered pityingly of another guest: &#x201c;He can&#x2019;t sell his flat, you know.&#x201d; He had looked across the room at the poor unfortunate of whom the remark was made and had seen a hodden-doon, depressed figure, visibly bent under the burden of unshiftable equity. That, he decided, was how people who couldn&#x2019;t sell their house looked&#x2014;shadowy figures, wraiths, as dejected and without hope as the damned in Dante&#x2019;s Inferno, haunted by the absence of offers for an unmoveable property. He had shuddered at the thought and reflected on his good fortune at not being in that position himself. Yet here he was deliberately courting it . . .<br><br>Elspeth&#x2019;s attitude was more sanguine. She had been unruffled by their previous moves&#x2014;from India Street to Moray Place, and then back again to India Street. The prospect of another flit&#x2014;a Scots word that implies an attempt to evade the clutches of creditors suggests, misleadingly, that moving is an airy, inconsequential thing&#x2014;did not seem to trouble her, and she had no concerns about the sale of the flat. &#x201c;But of course somebody will want to buy it,&#x201d; she reassured him. &#x201c;Why wouldn&#x2019;t they? It&#x2019;s one of the nicest flats in the street. It&#x2019;s got plenty of room and bags of light. Who wouldn&#x2019;t want to live in the middle of the Edinburgh New Town?&#x201d;<br><br>Matthew frowned. &#x201c;The New Town isn&#x2019;t for everybody,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Not everybody finds the Georgian aesthetic pleasing.&#x201d; He paused as he tried to think of a single person he knew of whom this was true. &#x201c;There are plenty of people these days who are suburban rather than urban. People who like to have . . .&#x201d; He paused for thought. He knew nobody like this, but they had to exist. &#x201c;Who like to have garages. <i>Homo suburbiensis</i>. Morningside man, who is a bit like Essex man but just a touch . . .&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Superior?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You said it; I didn&#x2019;t.&#x201d;<br><br>Elspeth smiled. &#x201c;You shouldn&#x2019;t worry so much, Matt, darlingest. And so what if we don&#x2019;t sell it? We can afford the other place anyway.&#x201d;<br><br>Matthew winced. &#x201c;If I dip into capital,&#x201d; he said.<br><br>Elspeth shrugged. &#x201c;But isn&#x2019;t money for spending? And surely there&#x2019;s enough there to be dipped into.&#x201d;<br><br>Matthew knew that she was right; at the last valuation, his portfolio of shares in the astute care of the Adam Bank had shot up and he could have bought the new house several times over if necessary. But Matthew had been imbued by his father with exactly that sense of caution that had created the fund in the first place, and the idea of selling shares in any but the direst of emergencies was anathema to him.<br><br>In general, Elspeth did not look too closely at Matthew&#x2019;s financial affairs. She had never been much interested in money, and very rarely spent any on anything but family essentials and the occasional outfit or pair of shoes. She was nonetheless aware of their good fortune and of the fact that thanks to the generosity of Matthew&#x2019;s businessman father they were spared the financial anxieties that affected most people. Her capacity for moral imagination, though, was such that she could understand the distorting effect that poverty had on any life, and she had never been, nor ever would become, indifferent to the lot of those&#x2014;perhaps a majority of the population of Scotland&#x2014;who were left with relatively little disposable income after the payment of monthly bills. This attitude was shared by Matthew, with the result that they were tactful about their situation&#x2014;and generous too, when generosity was required. <br><br>The farmhouse near Nine Mile Burn had not been cheap. Although it was far enough from Edinburgh to avoid the high prices of the capital, it was close enough to be more expensive than houses in West Linton, a village that lay only a few miles further down the road. Their house, which they had agreed to buy from no less a person than the Duke of Johannesburg, who lived at Single Malt House not far away, had been valued at seven hundred thousand pounds. For that they got six bedrooms in the main house&#x2014;along with a study, a gun room (Matthew did not have a gun, of course), and a drawing room with a good view of both the Lammermuir and Moorfoot Hills to the south and east; a tractor shed, a byre, and six acres of ground.<br><br>The Duke had been pleased that Matthew was the purchaser; they had met on several occasions before, although the Duke seemed to have only the vaguest idea of who Matthew was. Matthew&#x2019;s quiet demeanour, however, had been enough to endear him to the Duke.<br><br>&#x201c;I must say,&#x201d; the Duke had remarked to a friend, &#x201c;it&#x2019;s a great relief to have found somebody who&#x2019;s not in the slightest bit <i>shouty</i>. You know what I mean? Those shouty people one meets these days&#x2014;all very full of themselves and brash. We used to have very few of them in Scotland, you know; now they&#x2019;re on the rise, it seems.&#x201d;<br><br>The friend knew exactly what the Duke meant. &#x201c;Nouveau riche,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;They&#x2019;re flashy&#x2014;they throw their money around.&#x201d;<br><br>The Duke nodded. &#x201c;Whereas I&#x2019;m <i>nouveau pauvre</i>. I&#x2019;ve got barely a sou these days, you know&#x2014;not that I ever had very much.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;And you a duke,&#x201d; said the friend. &#x201c;Fancy that!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Well, a sort of duke,&#x201d; conceded the Duke. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not in any of the stud books, you know: Debrett&#x2019;s and so on. Or I&#x2019;m in one of them&#x2014;just&#x2014;but I gather it&#x2019;s not a very reliable one. It was rather expensive to get in; you had to buy sixty copies, as I recall, and I think quite a number of people in it are a bit on the ropey side. In fact, all of them are, I believe.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;People take you at your own evaluation, I&#x2019;ve always thought,&#x201d; said the friend. &#x201c;Behave like a duke and they&#x2019;ll swallow it.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;True,&#x201d; said the Duke. &#x201c;But frankly, that&#x2019;s a bit difficult for me, old man. I&#x2019;m not quite sure what the form is when it comes to being a pukka duke.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Take a look at some of the people who are what they claim to be,&#x201d; advised the friend. &#x201c;Watch the way they stand; the way they walk. They&#x2019;re very sure-footed, I&#x2019;m told. And they look down at the ground a lot.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s because they own it,&#x201d; said the Duke. &#x201c;Doesn&#x2019;t apply to me&#x2014;or not very much. I&#x2019;ve got fifty-eight acres in Midlothian and forty-one up in Lochaber, but most of it is pretty scrubby. Lots of broom and rhododendrons.&#x201d;<br><br>The friend looked thoughtful. &#x201c;No, you&#x2019;re not quite the real thing, I suppose. And then there&#x2019;s always the risk that the Lord Lyon will catch up with you.&#x201d;<br><br>The mention of the Lord Lyon made the Duke blanch. This was the King of Arms, the official who supervised all matters of heraldry and succession in Scotland. He had extensive legal powers and could prosecute people for the unauthorised use of coats of arms and the like.<br><br>&#x201c;Do you think Lyon would ever bother about me?&#x201d; asked the Duke nervously.<br><br>His friend looked out of the window. &#x201c;You never know,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;But I shouldn&#x2019;t like to be in your shoes if he did.&#x201d;<br><br>It was not the sort of thing a friend should say&#x2014;or at least not the sort of thing that a reassuring friend should say.<br>2. Distressed Furniture<br><br>The Duke of Johannesburg proved to be a most considerate seller, more than prepared to include all the contents of the house in the sale without adding anything to the purchase price.<br><br>&#x201c;We haven&#x2019;t lived in the place for years,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;And recently we let it out, of course. But all the stuff is ours, and some of it is actually quite good, even if it&#x2019;s a bit distressed, as the antique dealers say. Mind you, <i>distressed</i> is not quite strong enough for some of my furniture. My furniture has moved beyond being distressed. <i>Terminal </i>might be more accurate. I can just imagine the auction catalogues&#x2014;can&#x2019;t you?&#x2014;&#x2018;a table in terminal condition&#x2019; and so on. Hah!&#x201d;<br><br>Matthew was keen to keep as much of the Duke&#x2019;s furniture as possible, but Elspeth had other ideas. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s terrible old rubbish,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Look at this.&#x201d; She referred to the inventory that the Duke&#x2019;s agent had prepared. &#x201c;<i>A charming William IV library table with only two legs, but otherwise sound</i>.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Oh, I saw that one,&#x201d; said Matthew. &#x201c;It had a lovely green leather top.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s as may be,&#x201d; Elspeth retorted, &#x201c;but what&#x2019;s the use of a table with two legs? Or . . .&#x201d; And here she pointed to another inventory item. &#x201c;<i>A glass-fronted bookcase, circa 1860; no glass</i>.&#x201d; <br><br>She looked up at Matthew. &#x201c;What is the point, may I ask, of having a glass-fronted bookcase with no glass in the front? In fact, one might even go so far as to say that it&#x2019;s an impossibility. A glass-fronted bookcase with no glass is simply not a glass-fronted bookcase.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Perhaps,&#x201d; said Matthew. &#x201c;If you&#x2019;re intent on being pedantic.&#x201d;<br><br>They normally did not argue with one another, but even the most equable of couples may be expected to fall out over a move. And so Matthew decided at a very early stage that he would leave everything up to Elspeth and not dispute any of her decisions. Armed with this authority, Elspeth made all the arrangements, chose the date of departure, and did most of the packing herself. He helped, of course, mostly by taking the triplets around the Botanic Gardens in their three-seated pushchair. This inevitably brought a response from passersby&#x2014;looks that ranged from amusement to sympathy and sometimes on to disapproval.<br><br>&#x201c;Three!&#x201d; remarked one elderly woman as Matthew and the triplets passed her on the way to the greenhouse. &#x201c;My, you must have been insatiable!&#x201d;<br><br>Matthew was ready to let this remark pass with a polite nod of his head, but then its implications dawned on him. Did she really think <i>that</i>? he asked himself. <br><br>&#x201c;Excuse me,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;but I wonder what you mean by what you&#x2019;ve just said.&#x201d;<br><br>The woman blushed. &#x201c;Oh . . . oh, I don&#x2019;t really know. It&#x2019;s just that it must take a lot of energy to create triplets. Not every man . . . Oh dear, I&#x2019;m not sure that I know what I meant.&#x201d;<br><br>And then there was the visiting American woman who asked the triplets&#x2019; names when they were waiting together for a pedestrian light in Stockbridge. &#x201c;Dear little things,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;They&#x2019;re all boys, aren&#x2019;t they? What are they called?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Tobermory, Rognvald and Fergus,&#x201d; answered the proud father.<br><br>&#x201c;What wonderful Scottish names!&#x201d; enthused the visitor. &#x201c;Which is Tobermory?&#x201d;<br><br>Matthew hesitated. The truth was that he did not know, as although Elspeth claimed to be able to differentiate between the three boys, he had no idea. But a father could hardly confess to being uncertain as to the identity of his own sons, and so he pointed at random to one of the boys. &#x201c;Him,&#x201d; he said.<br><br>The woman bent forward to look more closely. &#x201c;We went to Tobermory last week,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;We were visiting Iona and afterwards we called in at Tobermory&#x2014;a lovely place . . .&#x201d; Her voice trailed away. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s wearing his brother&#x2019;s jumper, I see. It has Fergus knitted across the front.&#x201d;<br><br>Matthew waved airily. &#x201c;They share their clothes,&#x201d; he said airily. &#x201c;And of course they&#x2019;re far too young to dress themselves, or to care what they&#x2019;re wearing, for that matter.&#x201d;<br><br>In the last few days before the move, the boys were left in the care of Anna, their Danish au pair, while Matthew and Elspeth made final preparations. A couple of weeks before they were due to move in, the Duke agreed to meet them at the house to hand over the keys&#x2014;they had already paid the purchase price&#x2014;and to answer any final queries they might have. <br><br>&#x201c;I shall miss the old place,&#x201d; he said, as he stood with them in the doorway of the large ground-floor drawing room. &#x201c;We used to have such marvellous parties here back in the old days. White-tie affairs, you know. The men in Highland dress, of course, and the women in long dresses with tartan sashes. Interminable affairs, some thought, but I always enjoyed them. We used to give breakfast to anybody who was still there at six in the morning, and standing. Sometimes we even had to give them lunch. Frightful, but there we are&#x2014;it&#x2019;s very hard to ask guests to leave, you know. Some stayed for weeks.&#x201d; He paused. &#x201c;I never really knew how to do it until I read about what Willie Maugham said to Paddy Leigh Fermor after Paddy had for some reason been terribly rude to the old boy when he was staying as a guest at the Villa Mauresque. For some reason Paddy imitated Maugham&#x2019;s stutter at the dinner table&#x2014;causing dreadful offence. One doesn&#x2019;t imitate the host&#x2019;s stutter in any circumstances. Anyway, Paddy did and so Maugham said to him over coffee that night, &#x2018;I shall have to say goodbye to you at this stage as when I get up tomorrow morning you will already have left.&#x2019; &#x201d;<br><br>The Duke laughed.<br><br>&#x201c;How very tactful,&#x201d; said Matthew.<br><br>&#x201c;I never met Maugham, of course,&#x201d; continued the Duke. &#x201c;He was more my father&#x2019;s generation. In fact, Pa met him once or twice in Antibes. He said he was an ill-tempered old cove, but there we are. Leigh Fermor shouldn&#x2019;t have done what he did.&#x201d;<br><br>The Duke gazed fondly over the drawing room. &#x201c;Yes, those white-tie parties were grand evenings, and people paid attention to what they wore. You can&#x2019;t just add a white tie to Highland Dress, you know. It all depends where you are. If you&#x2019;re in Perthshire, for example, you can only wear a white tie with Highland Dress if you were born in the county. In Argyll, if the invitation says white tie&#x2014;and it does for occasions like the Oban gathering&#x2014;you wear a jabot, as I&#x2019;m sure you know.&#x201d;<br><br>Matthew was silent. He knew nothing about any of this and he wondered why nobody had ever taught him about these things that were so important even while being utterly unimportant.</p><h2>Three at Wolfe&#39;s Door (Nero Wolfe)</h2><p>In <i>Three at Wolfe's Door</i>, death comes a-calling not once but three times in this murderous collection of cases from the files of the world's greatest detective.

These three boys&#x2015;an orphaned poet; a gifted, fragile pianist; and a budding photographer with a talent for collecting secrets&#x2015;struggle to reach adulthood in a society where their heroes have been censored and exiled. Rich with love stories, intrigue, and a cast of dissenters and spies, <i>The Big Green Tent</i> offers a panoramic survey of life after Stalin and a dramatic investigation into the prospects for individual integrity in a society defined by the KGB. Each of the central characters seeks to transcend an oppressive regime through art, a love of Russian literature, and activism. And each of them ends up face-to-face with a secret police that is highly skilled at fomenting paranoia, division, and self-betrayal. A man and his wife each become collaborators, without the other knowing; an artist is chased into the woods, where he remains in hiding for four years; a researcher is forced to deem a patient insane, damning him to torture in a psychiatric ward. Ludmila Ulitskaya&#x2019;s novel belongs to the tradition of Dostoevsky, Tolstoy, and Pasternak: it is a work consumed with politics, love, and belief&#x2015;and a revelation of life in dark times.</p></p><p><b>Ludmila Ulitskaya</b> is one of Russia&#x2019;s most popular and renowned literary figures.

She is Visser One.</p><p> But, it has become known that Visser One's tactics for attaining her current position were less than acceptable--even to the Yeerks. Now she is on trial for treason.

All the dragons must flee. Their only refuge is a place above the clouds called the Rim of Heaven --- which may not even exist. Firedrake boldly volunteers to go ahead first. As he embarks on his journey, he meets Ben, a runaway boy. Together, the boy &amp; dragon make their way toward the Rim of Heaven, all the while running a step ahead of Nettlebrand, a monster who will stop at nothing to hunt down Firedrake. Their quest will truly become an adventure like no other.</p><p>It's a fantasy, it's long, and it's got dragons in it. <i>Dragon Rider</i> is bound to be another hit book from Cornelia Funke! Ever since the popularity of bestselling fantasies <i>The Thief Lord</i> and <i>Inkheart</i> went global a few years ago, legions of fans have demanded more books from the German author than she can reasonably hope to write each year. So, re-discovering this hefty, earlier novel from 1997 was a logical development--and her keenest readers will devour it as before. <p> </p><p> Aimed at slightly younger readers than her previous novels, despite its massive five hundred pages, <i>Dragon Rider</i> is about a brave young dragon called Firedrake who embarks upon a dangerous journey to the Rim of Heaven in the Himalayas--a magical place where silver dragons can rest easy, free from the threat of destruction by mankind and their only hope of sanctuary. The key to its location is a map rendered by a rat who is a master cartographer.</p><p> Firedrake is joined on his quest by Ben, an orphaned boy, and Sorrell--a wise-cracking Brownie that is an odd, but ingenious, grumpy kind of fairy. Their journey is not a straightforward one by any means. Created by an alchemist called Petrosius Henbane in 1424, Nettlebrand (a malevolent creature covered in impenetrable gold plates) is their biggest threat--he is intent on destroying them. Nettlebrand is aided by Twigleg, a homunculus who has stowed away in Ben's bag and who is feeding reports on their progress back to his master.</p><p> </p><p> Their exciting encounters are many...

"Perhaps the greatest trap ever set for women was the coining of this phrase," writes Sandberg in <i>Lean In</i>, which expands on her talk's big idea: that increasing the number of women at the top of their fields will benefit everyone. Sandberg, the COO of Facebook, encourages women to challenge the common workplace assumption that "men still run the world." She asks men to be real partners, sharing in the family work that typically leads to a woman's decision to stay home; she asks women who expect to start a family soon not to check out of work mentally. Sandberg's critics note that her advice may not resonate with the masses: The Harvard-educated exec can afford a veritable army to help raise her children. But Sandberg's point--which affects all of us--is that women who have what it takes to succeed at the highest professional level face many obstacles, both internal and external. <i>Lean In</i> is likely to spur the conversations that must happen for institutional changes to take place at work. --<i>Alexandra Foster</i><p><b>SHERYL SANDBERG</b>&nbsp;is chief operating officer at Facebook, overseeing the firm's business operations.

Yet Wilson also steadfastly resisted progress for civil rights, while his attorney general launched an aggressive attack on civil liberties.<br><br>Even as he reminds us of the foundational scope of Wilson&#x2019;s domestic policy achievements, John Milton Cooper, Jr., reshapes our understanding of the man himself: his Wilson is warm and gracious&#x2014;not at all the dour puritan of popular imagination. As the president of Princeton, his encounters with the often rancorous battles of academe prepared him for state and national politics. Just two years after he was elected governor of New Jersey, Wilson, now a leader in the progressive movement, won the Democratic presidential nomination and went on to defeat Theodore Roosevelt and William Howard Taft in one of the twentieth century&#x2019;s most memorable presidential elections. Ever the professor, Wilson relied on the strength of his intellectual convictions and the power of reason to win over the American people.<br><br>John Milton Cooper, Jr., gives us a vigorous, lasting record of Wilson&#x2019;s life and achievements. This is a long overdue, revelatory portrait of one of our most important presidents&#x2014;particularly resonant now, as another president seeks to change the way government relates to the people and regulates the economy.</p><p><b>John Milton Cooper, Jr.,</b> is professor of history at the University of Wisconsin. He is the author of <i>Breaking the Heart of the World: Wilson and the Fight for the League of Nations</i> and <i>The Warrior and the Priest: Woodrow Wilson and Theodore Roosevelt,</i> among other books. He was recently a fellow at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars in Washington, D.C. He lives in Madison, Wisconsin.&#x201c;THIS MAN'S MIND AND SPIRIT&#x201d;<br><br>Each year, in the morning on December 28, a military honor guard carrying the American flag presents a wreath that bears the words &#x201c;The President.&#x201d; Accompanying the honor guard are members of the clergy, who carry a cross and say a prayer. The clergy are present because the wreathlaying ceremony takes place in front of a tomb in the Washington National Cathedral. Since the day is only a week after the winter solstice, the low angle of the morning sun causes bright colors from the stained glass windows to play across the floor of the alcove where the tomb is located, over the stone sarcophagus, and on the words carved on the walls. The alcove contains two flags, the Stars and Stripes and the orange and black&#x2013;shielded ensign of Princeton University. The wreath laying takes place on the birthday, and at the final resting place, of the thirteenth president of Princeton and twenty-eighth president of the United States, Woodrow Wilson.<br><br>The ceremony and the tomb capture much about this man. The military presence is fitting because Wilson led the nation through World War I. The religious setting is equally fitting because no president impressed people more strongly as a man of faith than Wilson did. His resting place makes him the only president buried inside a church and the&nbsp; only one buried in Washington. The university flag attests to his career in higher education before he entered public life. Wilson remains the only professional academic and the only holder of the Ph.D. degree to become president. The inscriptions on the alcove walls come from his speeches as president and afterward. Wilson made words central to all that he did as a scholar, teacher, educational administrator, and political leader; he was the next to last president to write his own speeches. No other president has combined such varied and divergent elements of learning, eloquence, religion, and war.<br><br>In 1927, three years after Wilson&#x2019;s death, Winston Churchill declared, &#x201c;Writing with every sense of respect, it seems no exaggeration to pronounce that the action of the United States with its repercussions on the history of the world depended, during the awful period of Armageddon, on the workings of this man&#x2019;s mind and spirit to the exclusion of every other factor; and that he played a part in the fate of nations incomparably more direct and personal than any other man.&#x201d; Churchill was referring to the part that Wilson played in World War I and above all, his decision in 1917 to intervene on the side of the Allies. That was the biggest decision Wilson ever made, and much of what has happened in the world since then has flowed from that decision. Unlike the other American wars of the last century, this one came neither in response to a direct attack on the nation&#x2019;s soil, as with World War II and Pearl Harbor and the attacks of September 11, nor as a war of choice, as with the Gulf War and the Iraq War, nor as a smaller episode in a grand global struggle, as with the Korean War and the Vietnam War. Many have argued that the United States joined the Allies in 1917 because great underlying forces and interests involving money, ties of blood and culture, and threats to security and cherished values were &#x201c;really&#x201d; at work. Perhaps so, perhaps not, but one incontrovertible fact remains: the United States entered World War I because Woodrow Wilson decided to take the country in.<br><br>Despite his deep religious faith, he did not go to war in 1917 because he thought God was telling him to do it. When someone telegraphed him to demand, &#x201c;In the name of God and humanity, declare war on Germany,&#x201d; Wilson&#x2019;s stenographer wrote in his diary that the president scoffed, &#x201c;War isn&#x2019;t declared in the name of God; it is a human affair entirely.&#x201d; To Wilson, as an educated, orthodox Christian, the notion that any person could presume to know God&#x2019;s will was blasphemy. Likewise, as someone born and raised in the least evangelical and most God-centered of Protestant denominations, the Presbyterian, the notion of a personal relationship with the Almighty was foreign to him. Three months after the outbreak of World War I in Europe and at a time when he was enduring agonies of grief after the death of his first wife, he told a YMCA gathering, &#x201c;For one, I am not fond of thinking about Christianity as a means of saving individual souls.&#x201d;<br><br>Wilson practiced a severe separation not only between church and state but also between religion and society. Unlike his greatest rival, Theodore Roosevelt, he never compared politics with preaching. Unlike the other great leader of his Democratic Party, William Jennings Bryan, he never supported the greatest moral reform crusade of their time&#x2014;prohibition. Also unlike Bryan, he saw no conflict between modern science and the Bible, and he despised early manifestations of what came to be called Fundamentalism. By the same token, however, he had little truck with the major liberal religious reform movement, the Social Gospel. Wilson remained a strong Presbyterian, but his second wife was an Episcopalian who continued to worship in her own church. He was the first president to visit the pope in the Vatican. He counted Catholics and Jews among his closest political associates, and he appointed and fought to confirm the first Jew to the Supreme Court, Louis D. Brandeis.<br><br>A person with that kind of religious background and outlook could never be either of the two things that many people would charge him with being&#x2014;a secular messiah or a naï¿½ve, woolly-headed idealist. Wilson was bold, extremely sure of himself, and often stubborn, and he did think of himself as an instrument of God&#x2019;s will. But according to his beliefs, every person was an instrument of God&#x2019;s will, and even his own defeats and disappointments were manifestations of the purposes of the Almighty. Such an outlook left no room for messianic delusions. It did leave room for idealism, but that did not distinguish him from the other leading politicians of his time. Except for a few crass machine types and hard-bitten conservatives, all the major figures in public life during the first two decades of the twentieth century proclaimed themselves idealists. Roosevelt and Bryan did so proudly, and nothing infuriated Roosevelt more than to hear Wilson called an idealist. Moreover, this was, as Richard Hofstadter characterized it, &#x201c;the age of reform.&#x201d; Prohibition, woman suffrage, anti-vice campaigns, social settlement houses, educational uplift, and an embracing set of political movements loosely gathered under the umbrella of &#x201c;progressivism&#x201d; were the order of the day. In that context, Wilson came off as one of the most careful, hardheaded, and sophisticated idealists of his time.<br><br>His circumspection extended to foreign as well as domestic affairs. By his own admission, he did not enter the White House with much of what he called &#x201c;preparation&#x201d; in foreign affairs. As a scholar, he had studied and written almost exclusively about domestic politics, and the only office he had held before coming to Washington was a state governorship. Even before the outbreak of World War I, two years into his presidency, he began to deal with problems abroad, particularly fallout from the violent revolution next door in Mexico. Wilson had to learn diplomacy on the job, and he made mistakes, particularly in Mexico, where he originally did harbor some facile notions about promoting democracy. He learned hard lessons there, which he applied later in dealing with both the world war and the Bolshevik Revolution in Russia.<br><br>Like others at the time, Wilson invested American intervention in the world war with larger ideological significance and purpose. But he had no illusions about leading a worldwide crusade to impose democracy. The most famous phrase from his speech to Congress in 1917 asking for war read, &#x201c;The world must be made safe for democracy&#x201d;&#x2014;perhaps the most significant choice of the passive voice by any president. A year later, speaking to foreign journalists, he declared, &#x201c;There isn&#x2019;t any one kind of government which we have the right to impose upon any nation. So that I am not fighting for democracy except for those peoples that want democracy.&#x201d; Wilson did not coin the term self-determination&#x2014;that came from the British prime minister David Lloyd George, who also coined the phrase &#x201c;war to end all wars,&#x201d; words Wilson probably never uttered. Later, he did sparingly adopt &#x201c;self-determination,&#x201d; but always as something to be applied carefully and contingently, never as a general principle for all times and places.<br><br>Wilson&#x2019;s most renowned policy statement, the Fourteen Points, addressed specific problems of the time as much as larger conditions. Half of the points addressed general matters&#x2014;such as open covenants of peace, freedom of the seas, and an international organization to maintain peace, all carefully couched as aims to be pursued over time. The other half dealt with specific issues of the war&#x2014;such as the restoration of Belgium, an independent Poland, the integrity of Russia, and the matter of autonomy&#x2014;but not necessarily in specific terms&#x2014;so, for example, there is no mention of independence for subject peoples of the Austro-Hungarian and Ottoman empires. Wilson&#x2019;s moral authority and America&#x2019;s lesser taint of imperialism made the soberly stated Fourteen Points a rallying ground for liberals and progressives throughout the world, but if he could have heard the ways later generations would use &#x201c;Wilsonian&#x201d; as an epithet to scorn naï¿½ve efforts to spread democracy in the world, he might have echoed Marx&#x2019;s disclaimer that he was no Marxist, just Karl Marx: he was no Wilsonian, just Woodrow Wilson.<br><br>In World War I, he fought a limited war, though not in the usual sense of a war fought with limited means and in a limited geographic area. He fought with al...</p><h2>Secret Star (The Stars of Mithra)</h2><p>He was standing face-to-face with a dead woman...and she was holding a gun.

But in her irresistible presence, it was hard to remember there was any mystery more important to solve than that of Grace herself.</p></p><p>Lieutenant Seth Buchanan is investigating a murder scene when the supposed victim walks through the front door. Grace Fontaine is even more beautiful in person than she is in the portrait over her mantel, and Seth knows that she means trouble. But he&#39;s a cautious man, long accustomed to guarding his heart, and he&#39;s determined to continue the practice. Grace, however, has other ideas; Seth is the man she&#39;s been waiting for through all the long, lonely years she has spent as an unbelievably rich, impossibly beautiful child and woman. Thrown together by Seth&#39;s determination to solve the murder, the theft of three incredible diamonds, and the imminent threat to Grace&#39;s safety, the two struggle with the passion and the bond that pulls them together.

Drawing on his own experiences as a cowboy working in cattle and horse drives, Adams presents a vivid portrait of the challenges of trail life on a cattle drive from Texas to Montanaï¿½&#x20ac;&#x201d;the daily drudgery of cattle trailing, as well as the dramatic stampedes and other treacherous disruptions. Populated by a wide variety of well-drawn, lively characters, <b>The Log of a Cowboy</b> remains the landmark novel of the American West a century after its first appearance.</p> <ul> <li> First time in Penguin Classics </li> </ul></p><p>Andy Adams (1859&#x2013;1935) was an American writer of western fiction. Andy Adams was born in Indiana. His parents, Andrew and Elizabeth (Elliott) Adams, were pioneers. As a boy he helped with the cattle and horses on the family farm. In the early 1880s he went to Texas, where he stayed for 10 years, spending much of that time driving cattle on the western trail. In 1890 he left the trail to try his hand at business, but the venture failed, so he turned his hand to gold-mining in Colorado and Nevada. In 1894, he settled in Colorado Springs, where he lived until his death. He began writing at the age of 43, publishing his most successful book, The Log of a Cowboy, in 1903. His other works include A Texas Matchmaker (1904), The Outlet (1905), Cattle Brands (1906), Reed Anthony, Cowman: An Autobiography (1907), Wells Brothers (1911), and The Ranch on the Beaver (1927). The Log of a Cowboy is an account of a five-month drive of 3,000 cattle from Brownsville, Texas, to Montana in 1882 along the Great Western Cattle Trail. Although the book is fiction, it is firmly based on Adams's own experiences on the trail, and it is considered by many to be the best account of cowboy life in literature. Adams was disgusted by the unrealistic cowboy fiction being published in his day; The Log of a Cowboy was his response. It is still in print, and even modern reviewers consider it a compelling classic. The Chicago Herald said: "As a narrative of cowboy life, Andy Adams' book is clearly the real thing. It carries its own certificate of authentic first-hand experience on every page."This story of a real cowboy&#39;s life in the late nineteenth century includes long, dusty cattle drives, stampedes, river crossings and Indian attacks. The characters who people the &#34;Wild West&#34; are interesting and vividly described. However, Murphey is not an inspired reader. He has a pleasant voice but fails to add drama or intensity with pacing or even changing volume. This work is not very suitable for audio as it is not action packed nor is there much dialogue. The abridgment is also short and not engrossing. Though billed as a &#34;classic Western,&#34; this presentation will only appeal to real Western aficionados. S.C.A.

The tapes, gathering dust in a garage, did indeed exist, and this book reveals for the first time what they contain.</p><p>Here is Welles as he has never been seen before: talking intimately, disclosing personal secrets, reflecting on the highs and lows of his astonishing Hollywood career, the people he knew&#x2015;FDR, Winston Churchill, Charlie Chaplin, Marlene Dietrich, Laurence Olivier, David Selznick, Rita Hayworth, and more&#x2015;and the many disappointments of his last years. This is the great director unplugged, free to be irreverent and worse&#x2015;sexist, homophobic, racist, or none of the above&#x2015; because he was nothing if not a fabulator and provocateur. Ranging from politics to literature to movies to the shortcomings of his friends and the many films he was still eager to launch, Welles is at once cynical and romantic, sentimental and raunchy, but never boring and always wickedly funny.</p><p>Edited by Peter Biskind, America's foremost film historian, <i>My Lunches with Orson</i> reveals one of the giants of the twentieth century, a man struggling with reversals, bitter and angry, desperate for one last triumph, but crackling with wit and a restless intelligence.

And as always, amazingly for me, I was somewhat at a loss for what to say, and all I came up with was some general pleasantry/banality on the order of, &#x201c;How is everything?&#x201d; Orson answered me with, &#x201c;Oh, I don&#x2019;t know, do you?&#x201d; And I, acknowledging that my question had been excessive in scope, reduced it to, &#x201c;How is everything today?&#x201d; To which he answered, happy that he had forced greater specificity: &#x201c;Fine . . . as of this hour.&#x201d;</i></p> <p><i>Then tonight, two hours ago as I twirled the television dial, I was astonished to find myself watching the opening newsreel segment of</i> Citizen Kane<i>. I have just finished watching him grow old with makeup and acting skill on a body in its twenties, in a film designed by his mind in its twenties, and the film&#x2014;and he in it&#x2014;are so affecting and so near-perfect that the idea of watching anything else after seemed incomprehensible. I wonder, Was there nothing for him to do with the rest of his life after making it, is that his secret and does he know it?</i> Citizen Kane <i>his &#x201c;rosebud&#x201d;?</i></p> <p>&#x2014;HENRY JAGLOM, Journal Entry, April 2, 1978</p> <p><br>1. &#x201c;Everybody should be bigoted.&#x201d;</p> <p>In which Orson turns restaurant reviewer, confesses that he never understood why Katharine Hepburn disliked him, but knew why he disliked Spencer Tracy.

All right, what are we gonna eat?</p> <p>HJ: I&#x2019;m going to try the chicken salad.</p> <p>OW: No, you aren&#x2019;t! You don&#x2019;t like it with all those capers.</p> <p>HJ: I&#x2019;m going to ask them to scrape the capers away.</p> <p>OW: Then let me tell you what they have on their hands in the kitchen.</p> <p>HJ: It must be nuts in the kitchen. I&#x2019;ve never seen it this packed.</p> <p>OW: They&#x2019;re so busy, this would be a great day to send a dish back to the chef.</p> <p>HJ: You know, Ma Maison is not my idea of the legendary restaurants of Hollywood. The romance for me was Romanoff&#x2019;s. And then I got here and there was no Romanoff&#x2019;s.</p> <p>OW: Yeah! Romanoff&#x2019;s only stayed open until forty-three or forty-four. It had a short life. Romanoff&#x2019;s and Ciro&#x2019;s were the two restaurants that we did all the romancing in, and they both closed. Everybody was photographed with the wrong person coming out, you know? Romanoff&#x2019;s is a parking lot now, and when it was going broke, Sinatra came with sixteen violins and sang every night for three weeks for free, to try and help the business. We all went every night. It was sensational. Don the Beachcombers was another great place to take the wrong girl because it was dark. Nobody could see anybody.</p> <p>HJ: What about Chasen&#x2019;s?</p> <p>OW: Chasen&#x2019;s was a barbecue place, originally. I was one of the original backers of Chasen&#x2019;s&#x2014;and Romanoff&#x2019;s.</p> <p>HJ: You owned Romanoff&#x2019;s?</p> <p>OW: Yes, and he never gave me anything. Nor did Chasen. I was a founder of both those restaurants. Me and a lot of suckers. We didn&#x2019;t expect anything from Romanoff because he was a crook. And Dave Chasen somehow forgot the original barbecue backers when his became a big restaurant.</p> <p>Ma Maison was started in 1973, and continues. I wouldn&#x2019;t go for a long time because of the unlisted phone number. It irritated me so. It&#x2019;s a snobbish business not having a phone number. Somebody gave the number out on television, just to be bitchy. I don&#x2019;t envy these guys, though. It&#x2019;s a tough, tough business to run a restaurant.</p> <p>Waiter: Going to have a little lunch today? We have scallops, if you want, Mr. Welles. Plain, or we have them prepared with a petite legume.</p> <p>OW: No, it would have to be plain. Let&#x2019;s see what other choices I have.</p> <p>W: Just in case, no more crab salad.</p> <p>OW: No more crab salad. Wish you hadn&#x2019;t mentioned it. I wouldn&#x2019;t have known what I wasn&#x2019;t gonna get!</p> <p>W: Would you wish the salad with grapefruit and orange?</p> <p>OW: That&#x2019;s a terrible idea. A weird mixture. It&#x2019;s awful&#x2014;typically German. We&#x2019;re having the chicken salad without . . . without capers.</p> <p>HJ: They ruined the chicken salad when they started using that mustard. It&#x2019;s a whole different chicken salad.</p> <p>OW: They have a new chef.</p> <p>W: And roast pork?</p> <p>OW: Oh, my God. On a hot day, roast pork? I can&#x2019;t eat pork. My diet. But I&#x2019;ll order it, just to smell pork. Bassanio says to Shylock: &#x201c;If it please you to dine with us.&#x201d; And Shylock says: &#x201c;Yes, to smell pork; to eat of the habitation which your prophet the Nazarite conjured the devil into. I will buy with you, sell with you, talk with you, walk with you, and so following, but I will not eat with you, drink with you, nor pray with you.&#x201d;</p> <p>HJ: Isn&#x2019;t there something about the devil taking the shape of a pig in the Bible? Or did Shakespeare invent that?</p> <p>OW: No, Jesus did put a whole group of devils into the Gadarene swine. Shakespeare was just trying to give Shylock a reason for not eating with them.</p> <p>HJ: I would like the grilled chicken.</p> <p>W: Okay.</p> <p>OW: And a cup of capers.</p> <p>W: Capers?</p> <p>HJ: No, no&#x2014;that&#x2019;s his joke.</p> <p>OW: So I&#x2019;ll have a soft-shell crab. Alas, he breads it. I wish he didn&#x2019;t, but he does. I&#x2019;ll eat it anyway. <i>Est-que vous avez l&#x2019;aspirine</i>? Have you any aspirin?</p> <p>W: Of course. Here you are, Monsieur Welles.</p> <p>HJ: Do you have some pain or something?</p> <p>OW: I have all kinds of rheumatic pains today. The knees. I always say it&#x2019;s my back, because I get more sympathy. But I&#x2019;ve got a bad right knee, which is what makes me limp and walk badly. The weather must be changing. I never believed that, until I became arthritic. I just started to ache the last half hour. I think it&#x2019;s gonna rain or something. Aspirin is great stuff. I have no stomach problems, and no allergy to it.</p> <p><i>(Waiter exits.)</i></p> <p>HJ: Isn&#x2019;t that terrible, the Tennessee Williams thing? Did you hear how he died?</p> <p>OW: Only that he died last night. How did he die?</p> <p>HJ: There was a special kind of pipe that he used to inhale something. And it stopped him from being able to swallow or breathe, or . . .</p> <p>OW: Some dope? Or maybe a roast beef sandwich.</p> <p>HJ: &#x201c;Natural causes.&#x201d; Then they went to &#x201c;unknown causes.&#x201d; So mysterious.</p> <p>OW: I&#x2019;d like to be somebody who died alone in a hotel room&#x2014;just keel over, the way people used to.</p> <p>Ken Tynan had the funniest story he never printed. He and Tennessee went to Cuba together as guests of [Fidel] Castro. And they were in the massimo leader&#x2019;s office, and there are several other people there, people close to El Jefe, including Che Guevara. Tynan spoke a little fractured Spanish, and Castro spoke quite good English, and they were deep in conversation. But Tennessee had gotten a little bored. He was sitting off, kind of by himself. And he motioned over to Guevara, and said (in a Southern accent), &#x201c;Would you mind running out and getting me a couple of tamales?&#x201d;</p> <p>HJ: Do you think Tynan made it up?</p> <p>OW: Tynan wasn&#x2019;t a fantasist. Tennessee certainly said it to somebody. But I&#x2019;ve suspected that he improved it, maybe, by making it Guevara.</p> <p>Did I ever tell you about the play of his I lost, like a fool, to [Elia] Kazan? Eddie Dowling, who used to be a producer on Broadway, sent me a play by a writer called Tennessee Williams. I didn&#x2019;t even read it. I said, &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t do this; I just can&#x2019;t consider a play now.&#x201d; It was called <i>The Glass Menagerie</i>.</p> <p>HJ: <i>The Glass Menagerie</i>&#x2014;my God.</p> <p>OW: If I had done <i>The Glass Menagerie</i>, I would have done all those others. A big dumb mistake.</p> <p>HJ: A pity . . . By the way, I was just reading Garson Kanin&#x2019;s book on Tracy and Hepburn.</p> <p>OW: I blurbed that book. I thought if I wrote something, I&#x2019;d finally make it with Katie! But instead, I found out it was the worst thing I could have done!</p> <p>HJ: I must say, reading it, I didn&#x2019;t understand why she was so upset about it.</p> <p>OW: I think it was that he said she and Tracy lived together that&#x2014;</p> <p>HJ: A lot of people knew that.</p> <p>OW: Particularly since she laid around the town like nobody&#x2019;s business.</p> <p>HJ: Hepburn?</p> <p>OW: Hoo boy! I sat in makeup during <i>Kane</i>, and she was next to me, being made up for <i>A Bill of Divorcement</i>. And she was describing how she was fucked by Howard Hughes, using all the four-letter words. Most people didn&#x2019;t talk like that then. Except Carole Lombard. It came naturally to her. She couldn&#x2019;t talk any other way. With Katie, though, who spoke in this high-class girl&#x2019;s finishing-school accent, you thought that she had made a decision to talk that way. Grace Kelly also slept around, in the dressing room when nobody was looking, but she never said anything. Katie was different. She was a free woman when she was young. Very much what the girls are now.</p> <p>HJ: I wonder what she&#x2019;s got against you. Did you ever do anything to Tracy, or say anything about him?</p> <p>OW: I was never a fan of his. When I was a young man, I got up and made a fuss at <i>Captain Outrageous</i>&#x2014;uh, <i>Courageous</i>.</p> <p>HJ: Well, you see, that probably got back to Hepburn at some point, and that&#x2019;s why she doesn&#x2019;t like you.</p> <p>OW: Come on. Nobody knew who I was when I did that. I was nineteen years old. I stood up in the Paramount Theater and said, &#x201c;You ought to be ashamed of yourself!&#x201d; when he was doing the Portuguese accent. With the curled hair! The usher told me to get out because I was making such fun of his performance.</p> <p>HJ: Did you bark?</p> <p>OW: No, I was imitating his accent as he went along.</p> <p>HJ: The single lapse in his career.</p> <p>OW: That was not the only one. He had several. I&#x2019;m having a hard time trying to think of a great Tracy performance. Well, he was gigantic in<i> Judgment at Nuremberg</i>, although it is not a great picture, but I couldn&#x2019;t stand him in those romantic things with Hepburn.</p> <p>HJ: You didn&#x2019;t find him charming as hell?</p> <p>OW: No, no charm. To me, he was just a hateful, hateful man. Tracy hated me, but he hated everybody. Once I picked him up in London, in a bar, to take him out to Nutley Abbey, which was Larry [Olivier] and Vivien [Leigh]&#x2019;s place in the country. Everybody came up to me and asked for autographs and didn&#x2019;t notice him at all. I was the Third Man, for God&#x2019;s sake, and he had white hair. What did he expect? And then he sat there at the table saying, &#x201c;Everybody looks at you, and nobody looks at me.&#x201d; All day long, he was just raging. Because he was the big movie star, you know. When he was on the set it was, &#x201c;Why is that actor distracting everyone while I&#x2019;m talking?&#x201d;</p> <p>But I don&#x2019;t think that&#x2019;s it, really. I think Katie just doesn&#x2019;t like me. She doesn&#x2019;t like the way I look. Don&#x2019;t you know there&#x2019;s such a thing as physical dislike? Europeans know that about other Europeans. If I don&#x2019;t like somebody&#x2019;s looks, I don&#x2019;t like them. See, I believe that it is not true that different races and nations are alike. I&#x2019;m profoundly convinced that that&#x2019;s a total lie. I think people are different. Sardinians, for example, have stubby little fingers. Bosnians have short necks.</p> <p>HJ: Orson, that&#x2019;s ridiculous.</p> <p>OW: Measure them. Measure them! I never could stand looking at Bette Davis, so I don&#x2019;t want to see her act, you see. I hate Woody Allen physically, I dislike that kind of man.</p> <p>HJ: I&#x2019;ve never understood why. Have you met him?</p> <p>OW: Oh, yes. I can hardly bear to talk to him. He has the Chaplin disease. That particular combination of arrogance and timidity sets my teeth on edge.</p> <p>HJ: He&#x2019;s not arrogant; he&#x2019;s shy.</p> <p>OW: He <i>is</i> arrogant. Like all people with timid personalities, his arrogance is unlimited. Anybody who speaks quietly and shrivels up in company is unbelievably arrogant. He acts shy, but he&#x2019;s not. He&#x2019;s scared. He hates himself, and he loves himself, a very tense situation. It&#x2019;s people like me who have to carry on and pretend to be modest.</p> <p>HJ: Does he take himself very seriously?</p> <p>OW: Very seriously. I think his movies show it. To me it&#x2019;s the most embarrassing thing in the world&#x2014;a man who presents himself at his worst to get laughs, in order to free himself from his hang-ups. Everything he does on the screen is therapeutic.</p> <p>HJ: That&#x2019;s why you don&#x2019;t like [Bob] Fosse either&#x2014;<i>All That Jazz</i>.</p> <p>OW: Yes, that&#x2019;s right. I don&#x2019;t like that kind of therapeutic movie. I&#x2019;m pretty catholic in my taste, but there are some things I can&#x2019;t stand.</p> <p>HJ: I love Woody&#x2019;s movies. That we disagree on. We disagree on actors too. I can never get over what you said about Brando.</p> <p>OW: It&#x2019;s that neck. Which is like a huge sausage, a shoe made of flesh.</p> <p>HJ: People say Brando isn&#x2019;t very bright.</p> <p>OW: Well, most great actors aren&#x2019;t. Larry [Olivier] is very&#x2014;I mean, seriously&#x2014;stupid. I believe that intelligence is a handicap in an actor. Because it means that you&#x2019;re not naturally emotive, but rather cerebral. The cerebral fellow<i> can</i> be a great actor, but it&#x2019;s harder. Of performing artists, actors and musicians are about equally bright. I&#x2019;m very fond of musicians. Not so much of singers. All singers think about is their throats, you know? You go through twenty years of that, what have you got to say? They&#x2019;re prisoners of their vocal cords. So singers are the bottom; actors are at the top. There are exceptions. Leo Slezak, the father of Walter Slezak the actor, made the best theater joke of all time, you know? He was the greatest Wagnerian tenor of his era. And the king&#x2014;the uncrowned king&#x2014;of Vienna. He was singing<i> Lohengrin</i>&#x2014;if you&#x2019;re a Wagnerian, you know that he enters standing on a swan that floats on the river, onto the stage. He gets off, sings, and at the end of his last aria, is supposed to get back on the swan boat and float off. But one night the swan just went off by itself before he could get on it. Without missing a beat, he turned to the audience and ad libbed, &#x201c;What time does the next swan leave?&#x201d;</p> <p>HJ: How can those people have such charm without any intelligence? I&#x2019;ve never understood that.</p> <p>OW: Well, it&#x2019;s like talent without intelligence. It happens.</p> <p>HJ: If Tracy was hateful, none of that comes across in the work.</p> <p>OW: To me it does. I <i>hate</i> him so. Because he&#x2019;s one of those bitchy Irishmen.</p> <p>HJ: One of those what?</p> <p>OW: One of those bitchy Irishmen.</p> <p>HJ: I can&#x2019;t believe you said that.</p> <p>OW: I&#x2019;m a racist, you know. Here&#x2019;s the Hungarian recipe for making an omelet. First, steal two eggs. [Alexander] Korda told me that.</p> <p>HJ: But you liked Korda.</p> <p>OW: I love Hungarians to the point of sex! I almost get a hard-on when I hear a Hungarian accent, I&#x2019;m so crazy about them.</p> <p>HJ: I don&#x2019;t understand why you&#x2019;re saying that about the Irish.</p> <p>OW: I know them; you don&#x2019;t. They hate themselves. I lived for years in Ireland. The majority of intelligent Irishmen dislike Irishmen, and they&#x2019;re right.</p> <p>HJ: All these groups dislike themselves. Jews dislike themselves.</p> <p>OW: Nothing like Irishmen.</p> <p>HJ: That doesn&#x2019;t make them right, Orson, and you know that. And I don&#x2019;t accept this prejudice from you. I know that you don&#x2019;t really have it.</p> <p>OW: I do have it. I do have it. Particularly against Irish-Americans. I much prefer Irishmen from Ireland. If I have to have an Irishman, I&#x2019;ll take one of those. And Irishmen in England are quite good. All the great...</p></p><h2>Under the Moons of Mars: A Princess of Mars, The Gods of Mars, &amp; The Warlord of Mars (Barsoom #1, 2, &amp; 3)</h2><p>Ambushed in the cold moonlight of an Arizona night, Captain John Carter is inexplicably teleported to Mars, called Barsoom by its inhabitants. Legendary Barsoom-where hostile tribes of towering green warriors roam an arid landscape of dead cities and feuding city-states; where pilgrimages are made to a river of death that conceals a terrifying secret; where lifespans are measured in centuries; and where airships speed through the thinning atmosphere while duels are fought with swords below. Stranded and fighting for his life in a dying, savage world, John Carter embarks on one of the greatest adventures of all time as his destiny and Barsoom&#39;s become one.Thefirst three books of Edgar Rice Burroughs&#39;s brilliantly conceived Barsoom series-A Princess of Mars, The Gods of Mars, and The Warlord of Mars-are brought together here for the first time. The trilogy follows the saga of John Carter from his unexpected arrival on Barsoom through hair-raising adventures and startling discoveries from pole to pole of the planet.Edgar Rice Burroughs (1876-1950) is one of the most influential American authors of science fiction and adventure. His novels include Tarzan of the Apes and, available in Bison Frontiers of Imagination editions, The Land That Time Forgot, At the Earth&#39;s Core, Beyond Thirty, The Moon Maid, and Pirates of Venus.

By the author of City of Golden Shadow, River of Blue Fire, and Mountain of Black Glass.</p><p>With <i>Sea of Silver Light</i>, Tad Williams completes his massive Otherland quartet, one of SF's more intriguing explorations of the eroding boundaries of the human and the nonhuman, the living and the dead. Otherland is a sequence that contains many secrets, and Williams plays fair by unpacking all of them in the final book. A group of adventurers searching for a cure for comatose children find themselves trapped in a sequence of virtual worlds, the only opponents of a conspiracy of the rich to live forever in a dream. Now, they are forced to make an uneasy alliance with their only surviving former enemy against his treacherous sidekick Johnny Wulgaru, a serial killer with a chance to play God forever. <p> Williams manages a vast cast of emotionally involving characters with considerable panache, but the real strength of the book is its endlessly questing intelligence; it is, among other things, an enquiry into the nature of storytelling as a way for human beings to give structure to their perceptions of the universe around them. It is as story that <i>Sea of Silver Light</i> ultimately works so well--involving us in the grueling descent of a vast mountain, the siege of an underground fortress, gun battles in a nightmare Wild West. Williams never neglects to tell us how things feel. He efficiently ties up every plot strand and convincingly reveals every secret in this large, complex plot. <i>--Roz Kaveney, Amazon.co.uk</i></p><b>Tad Williams</b> has held more jobs than any sane person should admit to&#x2014;singing in a band, selling shoes, managing a financial institution, throwing newspapers, and designing military manuals, to name just a few.

In her <b>Selected Stories</b>, Alice Munro makes lives that seem small unfold until they are revealed to be as spacious as prairies and locates the moments of love and betrayal, desire and forgiveness, that change those lives forever. To read these stories--about a traveling salesman and his children on an impromptu journey; an abandoned woman choosing between seduction and solitude--is to succumb to the spell of a writer who enchants her readers utterly even as she restores them to their truest selves.</p><p>"Too many things," a creative writing instructor tells the narrator of "Differently." "Too many things going on at the same time; also too many people. Think, he told her. What is the important thing? What do you want us to pay attention to? Think." What does Alice Munro want us to pay attention to in her <i>Selected Stories</i>? Everything, really, and so her narratives loop back on themselves, jump decades backward and forward in time, introduce characters who later drop out of the action, and generally break every rule in the short-story-writing book. In "Carried Away," for instance, a dead character makes a sudden, inexplicable appearance in what is otherwise the thoroughly naturalistic account of a librarian's disappointment with love. "The Albanian Virgin" is two stories in one: the first--the fanciful tale of Ghegs kidnapping a young Canadian woman--is told within the second, about a bookstore owner who has lost her own bearings after a divorce. There are stories that begin with their endings, and several more that end with beginnings; others are told from three or four different angles, each with varying degrees of reliability. Taken together, they form an intricate web of relationships and connections, falsehood and anecdote, a kind of fictional palimpsest laid over the faint traces of plot.<p> And yet Munro trusts her readers; she believes that we will pay attention to all these things and more. She aims to create the illusion that everything in her fiction has been left in, and it is this very capaciousness that sets her work apart, making possible the keen psychological insight of her stories about marriage as well as the cool violence of "Vandals" or "Fits." Hers is an unusual sort of realism, technically innovative and amenable--especially in the later work--to loose ends. (It also possesses a quick, flinty wit: "This was the first time I understood how God could become a real opponent, not just some kind of nuisance or large decoration," says the narrator of "The Progress of Love.") To call Munro the Canadian Chekhov is by now a commonplace--and yet she may have done more for the short fiction form than any writer since. These are stories that will be read, savored, and admired hundreds of years from now. <i>--Mary Park</i></p>Spanning almost thirty years and settings that range from big cities to small towns and farmsteads of rural Canada, this magnificent collection brings together twenty-eight stories by a writer of unparalleled wit, generosity, and emotional power.

This nine-lesson small group study will help participants understand how the gospel shapes every aspect of life. Each lesson is self-contained, featuring clear teaching from Scripture, and requires no extra work outside of the group setting. Designed for: Pastors and leaders who want to spur gospel renewal in their churches and ministries. Church-planters who want to form gospel DNA in the churches they start. Students and campus ministers who are looking to live out the gospel on campus. Christians who want to be more deeply formed around the gospel. Small group leaders who are looking for content that works with diverse groups of people. Missionaries who are looking for simple material to disciple new Christians.</p><p>Robert H.

World Harvest Mission is a missions sending organization with over 200 missionaries serving in sixteen countries. WHM has always believed the power and motive for mission is the gospel of grace at work in the life of a believer. But, while doing cross-cultural, team-oriented ministry, they discovered how challenging it is to stay focused on the gospel, even as they shared it with others. So they begin writing material to keep Jesus Christ and his mission front and center in their own lives and relationships. Soon pastors and ministry leaders were requesting WHM materials for use in their churches and ministries. Over the years, WHM has partnered with friends who share their passion for gospel transformation to provide gospel-centered training resources for the church and missionary community.

In his characteristically direct, simple, and compassionate style, he explores the four key aspects of love as described in the Buddhist tradition: lovingkindness, compassion, joy, and freedom. <br><br>In order to love in a real way, Thich Nhat Hanh explains, we need to learn how to be fully present in our lives. In <i>True Love </i> he offers readers the technique of conscious breathing as a method for synchronizing the mind and body to establish the conditions of love. He goes on to offer a mantra practice for generating love that consists of expressing four key statements or intentions in our relationships. These include: "Dear one, I am really there for you"; "Dear one, I know that you are there, and I am really happy about it"; "Dear one, I know that you are suffering, and that is why I am here for you"; and "Dear one, I am suffering, please help me." <br><br>In the concluding section of the book, Thich Nhat Hanh explains how love can help us to heal our own pain, fear, and negativity. He explains that we must not regard negative emotions as bad and repress them. We must recognize them as part of us and allow them into our consciousness, where they can be cared for by the "loving mother of mindfulness."</p><p>A Vietnamese Zen Buddhist monk, Thich Nhat Hanh is an internationally known author, poet, scholar, and peace activist, and was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize by Martin Luther King Jr. He is the author of numerous books, including the best-selling <i>Living Buddha, Living Christ; Anger: Wisdom for Cooling the Flames; Peace Is Every Step; </i> and <i> The Miracle of Mindfulness. </i> He has founded monastic communities in France, Vermont, and California and teaches actively around the world.TRUE LOVE, by prolific author and Zen monk Thich Nhat Hanh, feels somewhat like a Buddhist primer on how to love well. During the course of the two-hour reading by Buddhist practitioner James Gimian, the book covers the basics of mindfulness and how, with practice, it can help people develop greater compassion. Gimian&#39;s voice is slow and steady, a style that sometimes suits the spiritual attitudes that Hanh extols. But his presentation is often so flat it undermines the ideas with which Hanh wants to inspire his readers. Yet while Gimian starts his narration stiffly, he does warm up as he describes his beloved Buddhist tenets. His voice conveys the most varied tone as he relates Hanh&#39;s allegorical anecdotes of people who struggle to love.

Intended both as an introductory text for students and professionals in the field as well as an accessible read for the general public, Understanding Architecture addresses the basic principles of architecture. The volume is organized in 12 series of chapters based on a key architectural themes - including space, time, matter, gravity, light, silence, dwelling, ritual, memory, landscape, and place. Each chapter begins with an introductory essay, and includes a wide variety of historical examples from around the world, followed by in-depth analysis of 6 key buildings that further exemplify the theme of that chapter.

Tour.</p><p>Though she was born into slavery and subjected to physical and sexual abuse by her owners, Sojourner Truth, who eventually fled the South for the promise of the North, came to represent the power of individual strength and perseverance. She championed the disadvantaged--black in the South, women in the North--yet spent much of her free life with middle-class whites, who supported her, yet never failed to remind her that she was a second class citizen. Slowly, but surely, Sojourner climbed from beneath the weight of slavery, secured respect for herself, and utilized the distinction of her race to become not only a symbol for black women, but for the feminist movement as a whole.Nell Irvin Painter is Edwards Professor of American History at Princeton University.</p><h2>Antony and Cleopatra</h2><p><p><b>From the prizewinning author of <i>Caesar </i>and <i>How Rome Fell,</i> a major new account of the&nbsp;charged&nbsp;love affair between Antony and Cleopatra, richly informed by military and political history</b><br><br> A masterfully told&#x2014;and deeply human&#x2014;story of love, politics, and ambition, Adrian Goldsworthy&#x2019;s <i>Antony and Cleopatra </i>delivers a compelling reassessment of a major episode in ancient history.</p><p>In this remarkable dual biography of the two great lovers of the ancient world, Goldsworthy goes beyond myth and romance to create a nuanced and historically acute portrayal of his subjects, set against the political backdrop of their time. A history of lives lived intensely at a time when the world was changing profoundly, the book takes readers on a journey that crosses cultures and boundaries from ancient Greece and ancient Egypt to the Roman Empire.</p><p>Drawing on his prodigious knowledge of the ancient world and his keen sense of the period&#x2019;s military and political history, Goldsworthy creates a singular portrait of the iconic lovers. &#x201c;Antony and Cleopatra were first and foremost political animals,&#x201d; explains Goldsworthy, who places politics and ideology at the heart of their storied romance. Undertaking a close analysis of ancient sources and archaeological evidence, Goldsworthy bridges the gaps of current scholarship and dispels misconceptions that have entered the popular consciousness. He explains why Cleopatra was consistently portrayed by Hollywood as an Egyptian, even though she was really Greek, and argues that Antony had far less military experience than anyone would suspect from reading Shakespeare and other literature. Goldsworthy makes an important case for understanding Antony as a powerful Roman senator and political force in his own right.</p></p><p><b>Adrian Goldsworthy</b> is a leading historian of the ancient world.

It explores the ways Western civilization has changed as a result of cultural encounters with different beliefs, ideas, technologies, and peoples, both outside the West and within it. Presenting a balanced treatment of political, social, religious, and cultural history, this text emphasizes the ever-shifting boundaries of the geographic and cultural realm of the West.</p><p>Preface <p> As we enter the twenty-first century, the heritage of Western civilization is a major point of departure for understanding our own epoch. The unprecedented globalization of daily life has occurred in large measure through the spread of Western technological, economic, and political influences. From the sixteenth through the end of the twentieth century the West exerted vast influences throughout the globe for both good and ill, and the global citizens of this new century live in the wake of that impact. It is the goal of this book to introduce its readers to the Western heritage so that they may be better informed and more culturally sensitive citizens of the emerging global age. </p><p> Since The Western Heritage first appeared, we have sought to provide our readers with a work that does justice to the richness and variety of Western civilization. We hope that such an understanding of the West will foster lively debate on its character, values, institutions, and global influence. Indeed, we believe such a critical outlook on their own culture has characterized the peoples of the West since its earliest history. Through such debates we define ourselves and the values of our culture. Consequently, we welcome the debate and hope that The Western Heritage, seventh edition, can help to foster a genuinely informed discussion through its overview of Western civilization, its strengths, weaknesses, and the controversies surrounding it. </p><p> Human beings make, experience, and record their history. In this edition as in past editions, our goal has been to present Western civilization fairly, accurately, and in a way that does justice to that great variety of human enterprise. History has many facets, no one of which alone can account for the others. Any attempt to tell the story of the West from a single overarching perspective, no matter how timely, is bound to neglect or suppress some important part of that story. Like all authors, we have had to make selections for an introductory text, but we have attempted to provide the broadest possible coverage suitable to that task of introduction. To that end we hope that the vast array of documents included in this book will allow the widest possible spectrum of people over the course of the centuries to give personal voice to their experience and to allow our readers to enter into that experience. </p><p> We also believe that any book addressing the experience of the West must also look beyond its historical European borders. The students reading this book are drawn from a wide variety of cultures and experiences. They live in a world characterized by highly interconnected economies and instant communication between cultures. In this emerging multicultural society it seems both appropriate and necessary to recognize the ways in which Western civilization has throughout its history interacted with other cultures, influencing other societies and being influenced by them. Examples of this two-way interaction, such as that with Islam, appear throughout the text. To further highlight the theme of interaction, The Western Heritage includes a series of comparative essays, The West &amp; the World. (For a fuller description, see below.) Goals of the Text </p><p> Our primary goal has been to present a strong, clear narrative account of the central developments in Western history. We have also sought to call attention to certain critical themes:</p><p>The capacity of Western civilization from the time of the Greeks to the present to generate transforming self-criticism. The development of political freedom, constitutional government, and concern for the rule of law and individual rights. The shifting relations among religion, society, and the state. The development of science and technology and their expanding impact on thought, social institutions, and everyday life. The major religious and intellectual currents that have shaped Western culture. </p><p> We believe that these themes have been fundamental in Western civilization, shaping the past and exerting a continuing influence on the present. </p><p> FLEXIBLE PRESENTATION The Western Heritage, seventh edition, is designed to accommodate a variety of approaches to a course in Western civilization, allowing teachers to stress what is most important to them. Some teachers will ask students to read all the chapters. Others will select among them to re-enforce assigned readings and lectures. We have reorganized and rewritten the last two chapters (30 and 31) to permit instructors to end their course by emphasizing either social or political factors in the twentieth-century experience. </p><p> INTEGRATED SOCIAL, CULTURAL, AND POLITICAL HISTORY The Western Heritage provides one of the richest accounts of the social history of the West available today, with strong coverage of family life, the changing roles of women, and the place of the family in relation to broader economic, political, and social developments. This coverage reflects the explosive growth in social historical research in the past quarter century, which has enriched virtually all areas of historical study. In this edition we have again expanded both the breadth and depth of our coverage of social history through revisions of existing chapters, the addition of major new material, and the inclusion of new documents. </p><p> While strongly believing in the study of the social experience of the West, we also share the conviction that internal and external political events have shaped the Western experience in fundamental and powerful ways. The experiences of Europeans in the twentieth century under fascism, national socialism, and communism demonstrate that influence, as has, more recently, the collapse of communism in the former Soviet Union and eastern Europe. We have also been told repeatedly by teachers that no matter what their own historical specialization, they believe that a political narrative gives students an effective tool to begin to organize their understanding of the past. Consequently, we have made every effort to integrate the political with the social, cultural, and intellectual. </p><p> No other survey text presents so full an account of the religious and intellectual development of the West. People may be political and social beings, but they are also reasoning and spiritual beings. What they think and believe are among the most important things we can know about them. Their ideas about God, society, law, gender, human nature, and the physical world have changed over the centuries and continue to change. We cannot fully grasp our own approach to the world without understanding the intellectual currents of the past and their influence on our thoughts and conceptual categories. </p><p> CLARITY AND ACCESSIBILITY Good narrative history requires clear, vigorous prose. As in earlier editions, we have paid careful attention to the quality of our writing, subjecting every paragraph to critical scrutiny. Our goal was to make our presentation fully accessible to students without compromising vocabulary or conceptual level. We hope this effort will benefit both teachers and students.</p><p>Changes in the<br> Seventh Edition </p><p> INTRODUCING ART &amp; THE WEST A beautiful and important new feature enhances students' understanding of the artistic heritage of the West. In every chapter we highlight a work of art or architecture and discuss how the work illuminates and reflects the period in which it was created. In Chapter 5, for example, a portrait of a young woman on the wall of a house in Pompeii and the accompanying essay provide a glimpse into the life of well-to-do young women in the Roman Empire (p. 161). In Chapter 7, two views of Salisbury Cathedral illustrate an essay on Gothic architecture (p. 248). In Chapter 16, two paintings tell contrasting stories about domestic life in eighteenth-century France (p. 526), and in Part 4, works by Turner, Manet, and Seurat illustrate both the power of the new industrialism and its effects on European social life. Part 5 includes discussions of paintings by Grosz, Magritte, and Picasso. In Chapter 30, Bread, painted by the Soviet realist Tatjiana Yablonskaya, and Jackson Pollock's One (Number 31, 1950), offer starkly contrasting views of twentieth-century culture (p. 1040). (See p. xxiv for a complete list of Art &amp; The West essays.) </p><p> THE WEST &amp; THE WORLD In this feature, we focus on six subjects, comparing Western institutions with those of other parts of the world, or discussing the ways in which developments in the West have influenced cultures in other areas of the globe. In the seventh edition, the essays are:</p><p>Part 1: Ancient Warfare (new) (p. 186) Part 2: The Invention of Printing in China and Europe (new) (p. 284) Part 3: The Columbian Exchange (new) (p. 582) Part 4: The Abolition of Slavery in the Transatlantic Economy (p. 736) Part 5: Imperialism: Ancient and Modern (p. 928) Part 6: Energy and the Modern World (new) (p. 1116) </p><p> RECENT SCHOLARSHIP As in previous editions, changes in this edition reflect our determination to incorporate the most recent developments in historical scholarship and the concerns of professional historians. Of particular interest are expanded discussions of:</p><p>Women in the history of the West. Adding to our longstanding commitment to the inclusion of the experience of women in Western civilization, this edition presents new scholarship on women in the ancient world and the Middle Ages, women and the scientific revolution, and women under the authoritarian governments of the twentieth century. (See, especially, chapters 3, 4, 5, 7, 14, 30. ) The Scientific Revolution. Chapter 14, which addresses the rise of the new science, has been wholly revised and rewritten to clarify the new scientific theory arising from the Copernican revolution, the new understanding of the Galileo case, the role of women in the new science, and the social institutions of the new science. The Dutch Golden Age. A new section in Chapter 15 discusses the United Netherlands during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. Africa and the transatlantic economy. An extensive section in Chapter 17 explores the relationship of Africa to the transatlantic economy of the sixteenth through eighteenth centuries. We examine the role of African society and politics in the slave trade, the experience of Africans forcibly transported to the Americas, and the incorporation of elements of African culture into the New World. Jewish thinkers in the Enlightenment. A new section in Chapter 18 discusses the thought of Spinoza and Moses Mendelsohn as they relate to the role of Jewish religion and society in the wider European culture. The Holocaust. The discussion of the Holocaust has been significantly expanded in two ways. Chapter 29 provides more analysis of the causes of the Holocaust, and Chapter 30 includes an extensive new narrative of the particular case of the destruction of the Jews of Poland. Twentieth-century social history. The seventh edition of The Western Heritage presents the most extensive treatment of twentieth-century social history available in a survey text. We examine, in Chapter 30, the experiences of women under authoritarian governments, the collectivization of Soviet agriculture, the destruction of the Polish Jewish community, and European migration. The chapter concludes with a new section on the coming of the computer and the impact of new technology on European life. The history of the Cold War and Europe at the start of the twenty-first century. Chapter 31, on the Soviet-American rivalry and the collapse of communism, has been wholly rewritten and includes the conflict in the former Yugoslavia. Instructors may close their course with either of the twentieth-century chapters, depending on the issues they wish to emphasize. Chapter-by-Chapter Revisions </p><p> Chapter 1 The treatment of the origins of humankind has been completely rewritten to reflect the newest scholarship. </p><p> Chapters 3, 4, 5 contain new sections on Women in Homeric Society; Aspasia, Pericles' Common-law Wife; Greek Slavery; Women in Early Rome; Women of the Upper Classes in later Roman history. </p><p> Chapter 9 contains a discussion of medieval Russia. </p><p> Chapter 12 includes a shorter, rewritten discussion of The Thirty Years' War. </p><p> Chapter 14 has a wholly rewritten discussion of the Scientific Revolution and of the impact of the Scientific Revolution on philosophy, new or extensively rewritten sections on women and early modern science, the new institutions associated with the emerging scientific knowledge, religious faith and the new science, with an expanded discussion of the Galileo case. </p><p> Chapter 15 contains an extensive new section on the Dutch Golden Age, including the impact of its overseas empire on its prosperity. </p><p> Chapter 16 has a new section on The Impact of the Agricultural and Industrial Revolutions on Working Women. </p><p> Chapter 17 includes a much expanded and revised section on African Slavery, the experiences of Africans in the Americas, and the cultural institutions they brought with them. </p><p> Chapter 18 has a new section on Jewish Thinkers in the Age of Enlightenment with emphasis on Spinoza and Moses Mendelsohn. </p><p> Chapter 22 has a refocused discussion of Karl Marx's thought. </p><p> Chapter 25 expands the treatment of racial thinking and the non-Western world. </p><p> Chapter 28 includes a rewritten discussion of the Soviet Experience in the 1930s. </p><p> Chapter 29 expands the discussion of the Holocaust. </p><p> Chapter 30 is a largely new chapter on twentieth-century social history, with major new sections on state violence, women under authoritarian governments, the collectivization of Soviet agriculture, the destruction of the Polish Jews, and the impact of the computer. </p><p> Chapter 31 has been extensively rewritten and reorganized to reflect the latest scholarship on the Cold War through the collapse of communism. It ends with a discussion of Europe at the Opening of the Global Century. </p><p> The last two chapters are written so that instructors, though teaching both chapters, may choose to close their course with either, depending upon their personal emphasis. Those instructors wishing to emphasize social history might end the course with Chapter 30 and those wishing to emphasize political development and great power relations may choose to conclude with Chapter 31. </p><p> MAPS AND ILLUSTRATIONS To help students understand the relationship between geography and history, we have added relief features to approximately one-half of the maps. All 90 maps have been carefully edited for accuracy. The text also contains close to 500 color and black and white illustrations, many of them new to the seventh edition. </p><p> PEDAGOGICAL FEATURES This edition retains the pedagogical features of the last edition, including part-opening comparative timelines, a list of key topics at the beginning of each chapter, chapter review questions, and questions accompanying the more than 200 source documents in the text. Each of these features is designed to make the text more accessible to students and to reinforce key concepts.</p><p>Illustrated timelines open each of the six parts of the book summarizing, side-by-side, the major events in politics and government, society and economy, and religion and culture.

First in a series of movies/novels wherein McMurtry revisited the same characters at different points in their lives.</p><p>Larry McMurtry, in books like The Last Picture Show, has depicted the modern degeneration of the myth of the American West. The subject of <b>Lonesome Dove</b>, cowboys herding cattle on a great trail-drive, seems like the very stuff of that cliched myth, but McMurtry bravely tackles the task of creating meaningful literature out of it. At first the novel seems the kind of anti-mythic, anti-heroic story one might expect: the main protagonists are a drunken and inarticulate pair of former Texas Rangers turned horse rustlers. Yet when the trail begins, the story picks up an energy and a drive that makes heroes of these men. Their mission may be historically insignificant, or pointless--McMurtry is smart enough to address both possibilities--but there is an undoubted valor in their lives. The result is a historically aware, intelligent, romantic novel of the mythic west that won the 1986 Pulitzer Prize for fiction.Larry McMurtry is the author of twenty-nine novels, including the Pulitzer Prize&#x2013;winning <i>Lonesome Dove</i>, three memoirs, two collections of essays, and more than thirty screenplays.

He was intended for the ministry, but at thirteen he declines a scholarship and left preperatory school for high school, from which he graduated at fifteen. After graduation, he went to work. His family on his mother's side was identified with the early American scene, and from boyhood on he was saturated with tales and the color of Eastern pioneer days. In 1928 he and his small family moved to New Mexico, where his heart and mind were soon caputred by the Southwest. From this time on he devoted himself to fiction. <i>The Sea of Grass</i> and <i>The Trees</i> were awarded the gold medal of the Societies of Libraries of New York University in 1942. <i>The Town</i> received the Pulitzer Prize in 1951, and <i>The Waters of Kronos</i> won the 1960 National Book Award for fiction.

Usually, by the time the cops call me, things are pretty frantic; there&#x2019;s at least one corpse, several cars, a lot of flashing blue lights, yellow-and-black tape, and members of the press&#x2014;or at least the promise of the imminent arrival of same.</p><p>This crime scene was completely quiet. I saw no marked police cars, and only one ambulance, parked, its lights off. A young mother went by, one child in a stroller, the other toddling along holding Mommy&#x2019;s hand. An elderly man walked a Labrador retriever past my car. No one was standing around and gawking or otherwise doing anything at all out of the ordinary.</p><p>Odd.</p><p>A creepy shiver danced over the nape of my neck, even though it was the middle of a sunny May afternoon. Normally, I didn&#x2019;t start getting wigged out until I&#x2019;d seen at least one nightmarish thing doing something graphic and murderous.</p><p>I put it down to the paranoia of advancing age. It isn&#x2019;t like I&#x2019;m all that old or anything, especially for a wizard, but age is always advancing and I&#x2019;m fairly sure it&#x2019;s up to no good.</p><p>I parked the Blue Beetle and headed into the apartment building. I went up several flights of stairs that needed their old tile replaced, or at least scrubbed and shined. I left them to find a hallway carpeted in a low, grey-blue pile that had been crushed down to shiny smoothness in the middle. The apartment doors were battered, old, but made of thick oak. I found Murphy waiting for me.</p><p>At five feet and small change, a hundred and not much, she didn&#x2019;t exactly look like a tough Chicago cop who could face down monsters and maniacs with equal nerve. Chicks like that aren&#x2019;t supposed to be blond or have a cute nose. Sometimes I think Murphy became that tough cop she didn&#x2019;t look like purely for the sake of contrariness&#x2014;no amount of sparkling blue eyes or seeming harmlessness could hide the steel in her nature. She gave me her we&#x2019;re-at-work nod, and a terse greeting. &#x201c;Dresden.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Lieutenant Murphy,&#x201d; I drawled, with an elaborate bow and flourish of one hand, deliberately at odds with her brusque demeanor. I wasn&#x2019;t doing it out of pure contrariness. I&#x2019;m not like that. &#x201c;I am dazzled by your presence once more.&#x201d;</p><p>I expected a snort of derision. Instead, she gave me a polite, brittle little smile and corrected me in a gentle tone: &#x201c;Sergeant Murphy.&#x201d;</p><p>Open mouth, insert foot. Way to go, Harry. The opening credits aren&#x2019;t done rolling on this case, and you&#x2019;ve already reminded Murphy of what it cost her to be your friend and ally.</p><p>Murphy had been a detective lieutenant, and in charge of Special Investigations. SI was Chicago PD&#x2019;s answer to problems that didn&#x2019;t fall within the boundaries of &#x201c;normal.&#x201d; If a vampire slaughtered a transient, if a ghoul killed a graveyard watchman, or if a faerie cursed someone&#x2019;s hair to start growing in instead of out, someone had to examine it. Someone had to look into it and reassure the government and the citizenry that everything was normal. It was a thankless job, but SI handled it through sheer guts and tenacity and sneakiness and by occasionally calling in Wizard Harry Dresden to give them a hand.</p><p>Her bosses got real upset about her abandoning her duties in a time of crisis, while she helped me on a case. She&#x2019;d already been exiled to professional Siberia, by being put in charge of SI. By taking away the rank and status she had worked her ass off to earn, they had humiliated her, and dealt a dreadful blow to her pride and her sense of self-worth.</p><p>&#x201c;Sergeant,&#x201d; I said, sighing. &#x201c;Sorry, Murph. I forgot.&#x201d;</p><p>She shrugged a shoulder. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t worry about it. I forget sometimes, too. When I answer the phone at work, mostly.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Still. I should be less stupid.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;We all think that, Harry,&#x201d; Murphy said, and thumped me lightly on the biceps with one fist. &#x201c;But no one blames you.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s real big of you, Mini Mouse,&#x201d; I replied.</p><p>She snorted and rang for the elevator. On the way up, I asked her, &#x201c;It&#x2019;s a lot quieter than most crime scenes, isn&#x2019;t it?&#x201d;</p><p>She grimaced. &#x201c;It isn&#x2019;t one.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It isn&#x2019;t?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Not exactly,&#x201d; she said. She glanced up at me. &#x201c;Not officially.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Ah,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;I guess I&#x2019;m not actually consulting.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Not officially,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;They cut Stallings&#x2019;s budget pretty hard. He can keep the equipment functional and the paychecks steady, barely, but...&#x201d;</p><p>I arched a brow.</p><p>&#x201c;I need your opinion,&#x201d; she said.</p><p>&#x201c;About what?&#x201d;</p><p>She shook her head. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t want to prejudice you. Just look and tell me what you see.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I can do that,&#x201d; I said.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll pay you myself.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Murph, you don&#x2019;t need to&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>She gave me a very hard look.</p><p>Sergeant Murphy&#x2019;s wounded pride wouldn&#x2019;t allow her to take charity. I lifted my hands in mock surrender, relenting. &#x201c;Whatever you say, boss.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Damn right.&#x201d;</p><p>She took me to an apartment on the seventh floor. There were a couple of doors in the hall standing slightly open, and I caught furtive looks from their residents from the corner of my eye as we walked past. At the far end of the hall stood a pair of guys who looked like medtechs&#x2014;bored, grouchy medtechs. One of them was smoking, the other leaning against a wall with his arms crossed and his cap&#x2019;s bill down over his eyes. Murphy and the two of them ignored one another as Murphy opened the apartment door.</p><p>Murphy gestured for me to go in and planted her feet, clearly intending to wait.</p><p>I went into the apartment. It was small, worn, and shabby, but it was clean. A miniature jungle of very healthy green plants covered most of the far wall, framing the two windows. From the door, I could see a tiny television on a TV stand, an old stereo, and a futon.</p><p>The dead woman lay on the futon.</p><p>She had her hands folded over her stomach. I didn&#x2019;t have the experience to tell exactly how long she&#x2019;d been there, but the corpse had lost all its color and its stomach looked slightly distended, so I guessed that she died at least the day before. It was hard to guess at her age, but she couldn&#x2019;t have been much more than thirty. She wore a pink terry-cloth bathrobe, a pair of glasses, and had her brown hair pulled up into a bun.</p><p>On the coffee table in front of the futon there was a prescription bottle, its top off, empty. A decanter of golden brown liquid, dusted for prints and covered by a layer of plastic, sat beside it, as did a tumbler that was empty but for a quarter inch of water still in its bottom, enough for a melted ice cube or two.</p><p>Next to the tumbler there was a handwritten note, also inside in a plastic bag, along with a gel-tip pen.</p><p>I looked at the woman. Then I went over to the futon and read the note:</p><p></p><p>I&#x2019;m so tired of being afraid. There&#x2019;s nothing left. Forgive me. Janine.</p><p></p><p>I shuddered.</p><p>I&#x2019;d seen corpses before; don&#x2019;t get me wrong. In fact, I&#x2019;d seen crime scenes that looked like photos of Hell&#x2019;s slaughterhouse. I&#x2019;d smelled worse, too&#x2014;believe you me, an eviscerated body puts off a stench of death and rot so vile that it is almost a solid object. By comparison to some of my previous cases, this one was quite peaceful. Well organized. Tidy, even.</p><p>It looked nothing like the home of a dead woman. Maybe that&#x2019;s what made it feel so creepy. Except for Janine&#x2019;s corpse, the apartment looked like its owners had just stepped out for a bite to eat.</p><p>I prowled around, careful not to touch anything. The bathroom and one of the bedrooms were like the living room: neat, a little sparse, not rich, but obviously well cared for. I hit the kitchen next. Dishes were soaking in now-cold water in the sink. In the fridge, chicken was marinating in some kind of sauce, its glass bowl covered with Saran.</p><p>I heard a quiet step behind me, and said, &#x201c;Suicides don&#x2019;t usually leave a meal marinating, do they? Or dishes soaking to be cleaned? Or their glasses on?&#x201d;</p><p>Murphy made a noncommittal noise in her throat.</p><p>&#x201c;No pictures up anywhere,&#x201d; I mused. &#x201c;No family portraits, graduation shots, pictures of everyone at Disneyland.&#x201d; I added up some other things as I turned toward the second bedroom. &#x201c;No hair in the sink or bathroom trash can. No computers.&#x201d;</p><p>I opened the door to the master bedroom and closed my eyes, reaching out with my senses to get a feel of the room. I found what I expected.</p><p>&#x201c;She was a practitioner,&#x201d; I said quietly.</p><p>Janine had set up her temple on a low wooden table against the east wall. As I drew near it, there was a sense of gentle energy, like heat coming up from a fire that had burned down to mostly ashes. The energy around the table had never been strong, and it was fading, and had been since the woman&#x2019;s death. Within another sunrise, it would be completely gone.</p><p>There were a number of items on the table, carefully arranged: a bell, a thick, leather-bound book, probably a journal. There was also an old pewter chalice, very plain but free of tarnish, and a slender little mahogany wand with a crystal bound to its end with copper wire.</p><p>One thing was out of place.</p><p>An old, old knife, a slender-bladed weapon from the early Renaissance called a misericord, lay on the carpet in front of the shrine, its tip pointing at an angle toward the other side of the bedroom.</p><p>I grunted. I paced around the room to the knife. I hunkered down, thinking, then looked up the blade of the knife to its hilt. I paced back to the bedroom door and peered at the living room.</p><p>The hilt of the knife pointed at Janine&#x2019;s body.</p><p>I went back to the bedroom and squinted down the knife toward its tip.</p><p>It was pointed at the far wall.</p><p>I glanced back at Murphy, now standing in the doorway.</p><p>Murphy tilted her head. &#x201c;What did you find?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Not sure yet. Hang on.&#x201d; I walked over to the wall and held up my hand about half an inch from its surface. I closed my eyes and focused on a very faint trace of energy left there. After several moments of concentration, I lowered my hand again. &#x201c;There&#x2019;s something there,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;But it&#x2019;s too faint for me to make it out without using my Sight. And I&#x2019;m getting sick of doing that.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What does that mean?&#x201d; Murphy asked me.</p><p>&#x201c;It means I need something from my kit. Be right back.&#x201d; I went outside and down to my car, where I kept a fisherman&#x2019;s tackle box. I snagged it and went back up to the dead woman&#x2019;s bedroom.</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s new,&#x201d; Murphy said.</p><p>I set the box on the floor and opened it. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve been teaching my apprentice thaumaturgy. We have to go out to the country sometimes, for safety&#x2019;s sake.&#x201d; I rummaged through the box and finally drew out a plastic test tube full of metallic grains. &#x201c;I just tossed things into a grocery sack for the first couple of weeks, but it was easier to put together a more permanent mobile kit.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s that?&#x201d; Murphy asked.</p><p>&#x201c;Copper filings,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;They conduct energy. If there&#x2019;s some kind of pattern here, I might be able to make it out.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Ah. You&#x2019;re dusting for prints,&#x201d; Murphy said.</p><p>&#x201c;Pretty much, yeah.&#x201d; I pulled a lump of chalk out of my duster&#x2019;s pocket and squatted to draw a very faint circle on the carpet. I willed it closed as I completed the circle, and felt it spring to life, an invisible screen of power that kept random energies away from me and focused my own magic. The spell was a delicate one, for me anyway, and trying to use it without a circle would have been like trying to light a match in a hurricane.</p><p>I closed my eyes, concentrating, and poured an ounce or two of copper filings into my right palm. I willed a whisper of energy down into the filings, enough to create a magical charge in them that would draw them toward the faint energy on the wall. When they were ready, I murmured, &#x201c;Illumina magnus.&#x201d; Then I broke the circle with my foot, releasing the spell, and cast the filings outward.</p><p>They glittered with little blue-white sparks, crackling audibly as they struck the wall and stayed there. The scent of ozone filled the air.</p><p>I leaned forward and blew gently over the wall, clearing any stray filings that might have clung to the wall on their own. Then I stepped back.</p><p>The copper filings had fallen into definite shapes&#x2014;specifically, letters:</p><p>EXODUS 22:18.</p><p>Murphy furrowed her brow and stared at it. &#x201c;A Bible verse?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yeah.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know that one,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Do you?&#x201d;</p><p>I nodded. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s one that stuck in my head: &#x2018;Suffer not a witch to live.&#x2019;&#x201d;</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>Chapter Two</p><p></p><p></p><p>&#x201c;Murder, then,&#x201d; Murphy said.</p><p>I grunted. &#x201c;Looks like.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And the killer wanted you to know it.&#x201d; She came to stand beside me, frowning up at the wall. &#x201c;A cop couldn&#x2019;t have found this.&#x201d;</p></p><h2>Zingerman&#39;s Guide to Giving Great Service</h2><p><p><em>Entrepreneurial phenomenon Ari Weinzweig, co-founder of the much-loved Zingerman's Deli, shares the secrets to providing world-class customer service.</em> Zingerman's in Ann Arbor, Michigan, is a beloved deli with some of the most loyal clientele around. It has been praised for its products and service in media outlets far and wide, including the <em>New York Times, Men's Journal, Inc. Magazine, Esquire, Atlantic Monthly, USA Today</em>, and <em>Fast Company</em>. And what started out as a small deli has grown to a flourishing restaurant, catering service, bakery, mail-order operation, creamery, and training business.</p> <p>Booming business and loyal customers are proof enough that the Zingerman's team knows a thing or two about customer service. Now in <em>Zingerman's Guide to Giving Great Service</em>, co-founder Ari Weinzweig shares the unique Zingerman method of treating customers, giving the reader step-by-step instructions on what to teach staff, how to train them, how to implement the training, how to measure their success, and finally, how to reward performance.</p> <p>Some of Zingerman's time-tested principles: </p><p>--Customers who get a great product but poor service won't be as loyal as those who are disappointed with a product but get great service.<br>--You'll get more complaints if people believe you care enough to listen to them. And that's a good thing.<br>--Employees who are rewarded, respected, and well cared for treat customers the same way. </p></p><p><strong>Ari Weinzweig</strong>, along with Paul Saginaw, founded in 1994 Zingerman's Community of Businesses, which includes Zingerman's Delicatessen, Zingerman's Creamery, and Zingerman's Bakehouse.

That's one statistic that surfaces in this short customer service guide from Zingerman's, the feisty food emporium in Ann Arbor, Michigan, which INC. magazine dubbed "the coolest small company in America." There's plenty of advice here and lots of tips on how to treat customers like royalty. For example, the 10-4 rule: Make eye contact within 10 feet of a customer; greet him or her verbally within 4 feet. Author Ari Weinzweig's narration--like Zingerman's signature coffee cake--is warm and homey.

Clearly, our understanding of evil needs to be revised. What we fear most can save us. From this tale, Barbara Kingsolver goes on to consider the chasm between the privileged and the poor, which she sees as the root cause of violence and war in our time. She writes about her attachment to the land, to nature and wilderness, trees and mountains-the place from which she tells her stories. Whether worrying about the dangers of genetically engineered food crops, or creating opportunities for children to feel useful and competent - like growing food for the family&#x2019;s table - Kingsolver looks for small wonders, where they grow, and celebrates them. </p></p><p>Readers familiar with Barbara Kingsolver will find that <i>Small Wonder</i>, a collection of 23 essays, shows the same sensitivity and thoughtfulness, the same rich knowledge of and love for the natural world, as her spellbinding novels. In "Knowing Our Place," she describes the two places in which she writes: a tin-roof cabin in Appalachia and her home in the Tucson desert. In "Setting Free the Crabs," she uses her daughter's decision not to take home a beautiful (and occupied) red conch shell from a Mexican beach to illustrate our own need to give up our sense of ownership of the earth, to resist "the hunger to possess all things bright and beautiful." Many of these pieces, like the lovely title essay, were written (or rewritten) in response to the events of September 11, which threw into relief the growing social and economic inequities that are so little remarked on in the American media. These are political essays, although Kingsolver is not a natural rhetorician; her prose is too supple and inclusive. She is more inclined to follow the turns of her mind, like water in a curving stream bed, than to hammer home a point or two. But she has a rare gift for apt allusion (from sources as wide-ranging as Robert Frost to Beanie Babies) and for the elegant use of facts and figures. And she is highly quotable. It is easy to imagine the speechwriters and activists of the next 10 years dipping into <i>Small Wonder</i> for inspiration and the perfect phrase. <i>--Regina Marler</i><p>In her new essay collection, the beloved author of <em>High Tide in Tucson</em> brings to us out of one of history's darker moments an extended love song to the world we still have. From its opening parable gleaned from recent news about a lost child saved in an astonishing way, the book moves on to consider a world of surprising and hopeful prospects, ranging from an inventive conservation scheme in a remote jungle to the backyard flock of chickens tended by the author's small daughter.</p><p>Whether she is contemplating the Grand Canyon, her vegetable garden, motherhood, adolescence, genetic engineering, TV-watching, the history of civil rights, or the future of a nation founded on the best of all human impulses, these essays are grounded in the author's belief that our largest problems have grown from the earth's remotest corners as well as our own backyards, and that answers may lie in those places, too. In the voice Kingsolver's readers have come to rely on&#x2014;sometimes grave, occasionally hilarious, and ultimately persuasive&#x2014;<em>Small Wonder</em> is a hopeful examination of the people we seem to be, and what we might yet make of ourselves.</p></p><h2>The Outcast Dead (17) (Horus Heresy)</h2><p>Action and espionage comes to the Horus Heresy via one of the best selling authors from the Black Library<br><br>When an astropath has a vision about the end of the heresy, it falls to a group of renegade traitors to get him off Terra</p><p>Graham McNeill has a established a strong reputation as a fantasy and SF writer with such best-selling novels as <b><i>Fulgrim</i></b>, <b><i>False Gods</i></b> and <b><i>The Ultramarines</i></b>.

But she has had many wonderful character parts in films and starred on Broadway and in the hit TV show Murder She Wrote. Her personal life has also been successful, with a long marriage, children, and a domestic life she loves. As the title indicates, though, her life has been a "balancing act" that has taken its toll. Lansbury's voice is heard throughout. She grew up in England but escaped to the United States during World War II. Her mother was an actress, and Angela followed in her footsteps, gaining early success with roles in The Picture of Dorian Gray and Gaslight. True stardom eluded her until she created the role of Mame on Broadway. Authorized biographies are often puff pieces, but this is a candid examination of an extraordinary life. The tone has a certain British reserve, but then so does Lansbury herself. Highly recommended.?Rosellen Brewer, Monterey Bay Area Cooperative Lib.

George Bickham, a noted engraver and calligrapher, first compiled this work back in the 1740&#x2019;s, from the best specimens of 24 of the leading calligraphers of his day. Unfortunately, Bickham published his work in 52 separate parts, over a period of eight years. In Bickham&#x2019;s own day it was difficult to get a complete set of the Universal Penman; today, apart from this edition, it is virtually impossible, for most surviving 18th-century copies lack certain rare plates. This Dover edition, however, contains every plate which Bickham engraved, and each is reproduced from an original so remarkably clear that these modern plates are actually better than most 18th-century originals.<br>This book contains more than 210 full-page plates, each crammed full of beautiful and interesting material. To list only part of its contents:<br>ï¿½ Over 125 pictorial scenes, clear copperplates of drinking scenes, family scenes, commerce, rustic festivities, duels, more.<br>ï¿½ Over 200 script pictures, male and female heads, busts, cherubs, griffins, birds, fish, etc.<br>ï¿½ 19 complete alphabets: round hand, round text, Old English, florid, foliated, and others.<br>ï¿½ 275 lettered specimens, overlaid with fine flourishes, swirls, spirals, featherings, volutes, etc.<br>ï¿½ Over 100 panels, frames, cartouches, and other effects<br>Over 950 lettered specimens, with thousands of words that can be lifted right off for reproduction.<br>Individual items in this book are permission-free, and may be used (up to ten items per use) without permission, payment, or credit line. Calligraphers find Bickham the best source for English round-handwriting; commercial artists, advertising directors, and designers all find Bickham first-rate as a source for immediately usable pictures and script that suggests antiquity, quality, and reliability. Craftspeople have found it rich in unusual ideas and motifs, while libraries and art historians find it a wonderful collection of 18th-century pictures illustrating art-life.</p><p></p></p><p></p><h2>When God Weeps: Why Our Sufferings Matter to the Almighty</h2><p>It&#39;s easy to trust God when things are going our way and the world makes sense. But when suffering strikes--especially seemingly senseless suffering--we are filled with doubt and stunned by events spiraling beyond our control. In the midst of suffering, we often question the very foundation of our faith--our belief in the God who says he loves us. Since our trust and obedience rest on God&#39;s character, the questions that life&#39;s tragedies force us to face are difficult, even frightening. Who is God? Can he really be trusted? What are his purposes in the face of suffering? If he can stop suffering, why doesn&#39;t he? Joni Eareckson Tada, a woman who has lived in a wheelchair for more than thirty years, and Steve Estes, a pastor and one of Joni&#39;s closest friends, explore the answers. When God Weeps is not so much a book about suffering as it is about God. It tackles tough questions about heaven and hell, horrors and hardships, and why God allows suffering in this life. Through a panoramic overview of what the Bible says about suffering, the authors make clear who God is, why he permits so much heartache and pain, and how it is we can trust him. With both a practical edge and heartfelt warmth, When God Weeps offers dependence on his love and mercy in spite of our doubts, fears, longings, and questions. It&#39;s a message much needed. Despair and discouragement are rampant. At the same time, fewer people are able to balance God&#39;s purposes and his mercies. Instead, attempting to avoid tragedy and suffering, many Christians confuse simple formulas for faith. But where does that leave the family who loses a son on a military mission?

Reflecting on her many roles--from northern coordinator of Martin Luther King's history-making quest to mother of a rebellious teenage son--Angelou eloquently speaks to an awareness of the heart within us all.</p><p><b>Oprah Book Clubï¿½ Selection, May 1997:</b> Maya Angelou has had more lives than the proverbial cat, and in <i>The Heart of a Woman</i> she continues the account of her remarkable life begun in <i>I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings</i>. In the first book of her bestselling autobiographical series, she describes her traumatic childhood in the small, segregated town of Stamps, Arkansas, during the 1930s. <i>Gather Together in My Name</i> picks up the story in the postwar years, when Maya, a single teenager with an infant son becomes, in short order, a cook, a madam, a dancer, and a prostitute. Next comes <i>Singin' and Swingin' and Gettin' Merry Like Christmas,</i> an account of her twenties and her unsuccessful first marriage to a white man. <i>The Heart of a Woman,</i> the fourth in the series, takes us through one of the most exciting and formative periods of Angelou's amazing life: her beginnings as a writer and an activist in New York. <p> Angelou has a happy knack of attracting the best and the brightest into her orbit, and <i>The Heart of a Woman</i> offers a veritable cornucopia of black luminaries in its pages. Singer Billie Holiday, writers John Ellins and Paule Marshall, jazz musicians Max Roach and Abbey Lincoln, and actors Godfrey Cambridge and James Earl Jones--Maya meets and learns from them all. Political activism soon follows as Ms. Angelou first organizes a theatrical benefit for the Reverend Martin Luther King and then becomes the director of the New York Southern Christian Leadership Conference office. Her involvement in the civil rights movement eventually brings her into contact with African freedom fighters Oliver Tambo and the charming Vusumzi Make, whom she marries and follows to Africa. </p><p> <i>The Heart of a Woman</i> is as honest, painful, funny, outraged, and outrageous as Angelou herself. From her debut at the Apollo Theatre to her meeting with Malcolm X, Maya Angelou gives us something to cheer about and plenty to ponder as well.</p>"I know that not since the days of my childhood, when people in books were more real than the people one saw every day, have I found myself SO moved."<p>-- James Baldwin</p><p>"Full of laughter and tears, love and hate, failures and triumphs, and above all, understanding."</p><p>-- John O. Killens</p><p>"Gather Together in My Name</p><p>"Gather Together in My Name is part of a select body of literature that includes The Autobiography of Malcolm X, Claude Brown's Manchild in the Promised land, and Ernest J. Gaines's The Autobiography of Miss Jane Pittman. Maya Angelou regards the world and herself with intelligence and wit; she records the events of her life with style and grace."</p><p>-- William McPherson, The Washington Post Book World</p><p>"Here the 'caged bird' soars, and sings in a voice as rich and funny, passionate and mellow as any writer I know."</p><p>-- Shana Alexander</p></p><h2>The National Trust Nature Companion</h2><p>A guide to the nature reserves owned by the National Trust, with emphasis on preserving the natural beauty and wildlife in these British habitats.

The Separatists, led by Count Dooku, the onetime Jedi and now secret Sith Lord, continue to press forward, and more and more worlds are either falling, or seceding and joining the cause. Under the leadership of Supreme Chancellor Palpatine, the Republic heroically battles on, championed by its huge army of cloned soldiers and their Jedi generals. <br><br>Anakin Skywalker, believed by some to be the prophesied &#x201c;Chosen One&#x201d; destined to bring balance to the Force, is now a Jedi Knight under the tutelage of his Jedi Master, Obi-Wan Kenobi. Death is a constant possibility&#x2013;and his chances of survival aren&#x2019;t improved by the unexpected arrival of an apprentice: Ahsoka, a brash, inexperienced fourteen-year-old Padawan apprenticed to Anakin. But there&#x2019;s no time for Anakin to question his latest orders: He and Obi-Wan have been assigned a new mission, and failure is not an option.<br><br>Jabba the Hutt&#x2019;s precious infant son has been kidnapped, and when the frantic parent applies to the Jedi for help, it falls to Anakin, Obi-Wan, Ahsoka, and their clone troops to track down the evidence and retrieve the missing Huttlet. And more is at stake: For a grateful Jabba just might allow the Republic access to the Hutt-controlled space lanes that the Grand Army desperately needs in order to beat the Separatists into submission. <br><br>But the Republic is not the only power that craves access to those space lanes. Count Dooku, determined to win the prize for the Separatists, has set a trap for the Jedi. When they find the Huttlet, they will also find Dooku&#x2019;s master assassin, Asajj Ventress, and countless legions of battle droids waiting to spring a trap.<br><br>The blazing new animated feature film Star Wars: The Clone Wars takes place in the years preceding Star Wars: Episode III: Revenge of the Sith and sets the stage for the groundbreaking TV series. Both contain all original material&#x2013;direct from the brilliant imagination of legendary <i>Star Wars</i> creator George Lucas.

Without that, we&#x2019;ll never be able to take the Outer Rim worlds. Unfortunately, that means we need the cooperation of the Hutts.<br><br>Chancellor Palpatine, on the logistics problems facing the Grand Army of the Republic<br><br>Ziro the Hutt&#x2019;s palace, uscru district, Coruscant<br><br>&#x201c;Could you kill a child?&#x201d;<br><br>Count Dooku thought it was an odd question, coming as it did from Ziro. The Hutt had been perfectly happy to go along with the idea of kidnapping his nephew&#x2019;s baby son. But if he&#x2019;d thought through the reality of grabbing Jabba&#x2019;s gangland power, then wiping out all rivals, even baby heirs, had to be high on his list of priorities.<br><br>Maybe it wasn&#x2019;t. And that would be a fatal mistake.<br><br>&#x201c;Could you?&#x201d; Dooku responded casually. &#x201c;Isn&#x2019;t he almost your flesh and blood too?&#x201d;<br><br>Ziro blinked, passing the nictitating membranes across his eyes with slow deliberation. It was the Hutt equivalent of raising a sarcastic eyebrow. The private chamber was deserted, with not even a serving droid to overhear them.<br><br>&#x201c;You don&#x2019;t understand us, even if you speak our language far better than most realize,&#x201d; Ziro said at last. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s Jabba&#x2019;s bloodline. Not mine. So I do whatever it takes, and my priority is my own offspring.&#x201d;<br><br>Ziro might have been playing the hard case, or he might have been serious. If he was serious, then Dooku hoped for his sake that he was ready to kill Jabba, too, because his nephew would send every assassin in Hutt space after him if he found out his uncle was responsible.<br><br>&#x201c;Try not to be too hasty,&#x201d; Dooku said. Don&#x2019;t blow this before I get what I need. The ploy was buying time. &#x201c;Extract maximum leverage from this.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You don&#x2019;t have to explain long-term strategy to a Hutt,&#x201d; Ziro rasped.<br><br>Dooku tried to stop himself from falling into a chain of reasoning with Ziro. It would bring the delicate edifice of his own operation crashing down if he said anything that made Ziro wonder if this kidnapping was going to achieve anything for him. Dooku wasn&#x2019;t convinced that taking Rotta would dislodge or even weaken Jabba&#x2019;s grip on power, but Ziro thought it would reduce his nephew to mere clay in his hands&#x2014;which was all Dooku needed.<br><br>Dooku was certain of one thing, though: harming the Huttlet would unleash a tidal wave of incredible vengeance, and Jabba was going to be around a long, long time to make sure he found everyone involved in the kidnapping and punished them in his uniquely inventive way.<br><br>Dooku was counting on it. He wanted the Hutt in the Separatist camp, and the way to do that was to frame the Jedi for Rotta&#x2019;s disappearance.<br><br>But if Ziro&#x2019;s cover is blown&#x2014;then he has to be silenced. We can&#x2019;t have Jabba realizing he&#x2019;s been maneuvered by us . . .<br><br>It would be too bad if anything happened to Ziro. After Jabba was signed up, Ziro&#x2019;s fate was inevitable; he would have to be silenced before he implicated Dooku.<br><br>Either Hutt would do, though, in a pinch. It didn&#x2019;t matter if it was Jabba or Ziro who denied hyperspace passage to Republic forces. Dooku wasn&#x2019;t selling ideology, and he was sure neither Hutt was buying.<br><br>&#x201c;Of course not,&#x201d; he said, smiling at a being he would kill without hesitation if he threatened his plans. He had no doubt that Ziro would do the same to him. &#x201c;But you do have to consider what you&#x2019;ll do with Rotta in the longer term.&#x201d;<br><br>Ziro eased his bulk across the marble floor onto a platform strewn with shimmersilk cushions that he swept out of the way. Hutts needed smooth surfaces to move properly; carpeting and upholstery didn&#x2019;t go well with a lubricating layer of slime. But Ziro surrounded himself with the finest examples of furnishing anyway. It was as if he wanted to show the rest of the galaxy how powerful he was in terms that other species could understand. Dooku didn&#x2019;t despise that. He felt the faintest pang of pity. It explained the Hutts&#x2019; need to flaunt Twi&#x2019;lek dancers and other glamorous humanoids, so radically, physically different that no Hutt could possibly have found them attractive. They collected them because humanoids coveted them, and so it sent the message clearly: I possess everything you lust after, so I have power over you.<br><br>It all came from fear. Hutts felt threatened at a subliminal level. Once Dooku worked that out, it had been far easier to deal with them by pressing gently on their paranoia.<br><br>&#x201c;Rotta should be on Teth soon,&#x201d; Dooku said, taking a slow turn to look at the doors. He could hear raised voices in the chamber beyond. He sensed anxiety; no unusual thing in a Hutt&#x2019;s palace with a capricious boss. Maybe the servants couldn&#x2019;t find whatever overpriced delicacy he&#x2019;d sent them to procure. &#x201c;Plenty of time to consider your position at your leisure.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m expecting confirmation any moment. Tell me, why do you hate your Jedi family so much?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;They&#x2019;re not my family, and haven&#x2019;t been for a very long time,&#x201d; Dooku said. &#x201c;Does it matter?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Motivation is everything in business.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Lord Ziro, I suspect you really have no need to ask. Would you put your future in their hands?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I wouldn&#x2019;t trust the Republic to do anything for Hutts except try to stop us from making a living.&#x201d;<br><br>Ziro saw Jedi and Republic as one entity. Dooku had reached a similar conclusion years before. &#x201c;And anyone who doesn&#x2019;t want to be part of their happy Republic family must be a tyrant or an anarchist. If a world wants to leave, it&#x2019;s accused of being undemocratic, because the will of its inhabitants doesn&#x2019;t suit Coruscant. Such a beautifully embroidered veil of irony.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You don&#x2019;t have to sell me on Separatism, Dooku. I don&#x2019;t care about your politics, but I know in which sauce my gorog is marinated.&#x201d; Ziro seemed the braggart in Jabba&#x2019;s extended clan, but sometimes Dooku saw hints of a subtler intelligence underneath. He kept a cautious eye on that. &#x201c;You help me get what I want, I help you get what you want.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Welcome to politics,&#x201d; said Dooku. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t delude yourself that it has to have party labels.&#x201d;<br><br>Dooku steeled himself to relax. The doors suddenly snapped apart; two droids strode in at a brisk pace, and Dooku slid quietly into a shadowed alcove to watch unnoticed from the sidelines.<br><br>&#x201c;Exalted Lord,&#x201d; one said in a flat monotone. &#x201c;We have bad news. Your nephew&#x2019;s son has been kidnapped by criminals.&#x201d;<br><br>Ziro reared up in feigned shock, then settled down again with a noise like slapping a wet stone. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s an outrage! Have they demanded a ransom? This is an insult to all Hutts! Organize a search team. We&#x2019;ll find the scum who did this to poor Jabba.&#x201d;<br><br>Ziro wasn&#x2019;t a bad actor, all things considered. But even if he&#x2019;d rehearsed it, his choice of words was revealing. Dooku noted that it was more about loss of face rather than concern for the child&#x2019;s safety. But Hutts didn&#x2019;t think like humans, and the social rules of organized crime were not those of middle-class Coruscant. He tried not to judge when his own species had so little to boast about at times.<br><br>Dooku listened, waiting for the droid to leave. Now to the next stage. Now to making sure that we lure the Jedi to Teth . . .<br><br>&#x201c;There has been no ransom demand yet, Lord,&#x201d; the droid said. &#x201c;Most unusual.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll see the scum fed to a rancor.&#x201d; Ziro held out an imperious hand to the second droid. Dooku couldn&#x2019;t quite see the other droid around the edge of the alcove. &#x201c;Get me the comlink. Let me console my nephew. I expect all Hutts to rally around and help him.&#x201d;<br><br>He&#x2019;s really getting into the role . . .<br><br>&#x201c;Lord Jabba is said to be inconsolable. He has asked the Republic to help&#x2014;to send Jedi to find the child.&#x201d;<br><br>Dooku was a hard man to surprise, but the thought of Jabba&#x2014;Jabba&#x2014;throwing himself on the sympathy of the Jedi hit him like a punch.<br><br>Why would the head of one of the most powerful criminal organizations in the galaxy, who could buy any number of bounty hunters and an intelligence network that many governments might envy, beg the Jedi for help?<br><br>It was an inexplicable move for a species&#x2014;a gang lord&#x2014;so concerned about loss of face, about looking weak, about being seen to be an easy target.<br><br>Not Jabba. And it will be explicable, if I think about it . . .<br><br>The Hutt was up to something appropriately slippery. Dooku wasn&#x2019;t sure what that might be, so he was instantly on his guard. But it was the most perfect stroke of luck&#x2014;unnaturally perfect&#x2014;for Jabba to ask the Jedi to walk into his setup and implicate themselves in the kidnapping.<br><br>Some would say it was meant to be.<br><br>And while Dooku didn&#x2019;t believe in luck half as much as he believed in the less random patterns of conspiracy, plot and counterplot, he wasn&#x2019;t about to pass up an opportunity.<br><br>He hoped the Jedi Council would do the decent, upstanding, moral thing, and say yes.<br><br>He was certain that they would.</p><h2>Discovering The Enneagram: An Ancient Tool a New Spiritual Journey</h2><p>A lively and practical application of the Enneagram--the widely discussed method of spiritual enlightenment which combines ancient wisdom and modern psychological insight.

Original.</p><p>The setting is a forested wilderness in the Northwest, circa 1911. The villain is a tall, egotistical woman doctor with an imposing jawline and a fierce will to dominate others. The victims are two wealthy English sisters, gullible health faddists after the fashion of those who flocked to Dr. Kellogg&#39;s sanitarium in Battle Creek, Michigan. But unlike Dr. Kellogg&#39;s comparatively gentle method of diet plus enemas, Dr. Hazzard&#39;s method was to literally starve her patients to death--and then defraud them of their valuables. Acclaimed true-crime writer Jack Olsen calls this book, &#34;a literary and journalistic achievement of the highest order,&#34; and says, &#34;Gregg Olsen reinforces his standing as one of America&#39;s greatest crime reporters, evoking the early twentieth century with a master&#39;s touch. No reader will ever forget Dr. Linda Burfield Hazzard and her sadistic technique of mass murder by starvation.&#34;In 1911 two wealthy British heiresses, Claire and Dora Williamson, came to a sanitorium in the forests of the Pacific Northwest to undergo the revolutionary "fasting treatment" of Dr. Linda Burfield Hazzard. It was supposed to be a holiday for the two sisters. But within a month of arriving at what the locals called Starvation Heights, the women were emaciated shadows of their former selves, waiting for death. They were not the first victims of Linda Hazzard, a quack doctor of extraordinary evil and greed who would stop at nothing short of murder to achieve her ambitions. As their jewelry disappeared and forged bank drafts began transferring their wealth to Hazzard's accounts, Dora Williamson sent a last desperate plea to a friend in Australia, begging her to save them from the brutal treatments and lonely isolation of Starvation Heights. <br>In this true story--a haunting saga of medical murder set in an era of steamships and gaslights--Gregg Olsen reveals one of the most unusual and disturbing criminal cases in American history.</p><h2>The Spyglass : A Book About Faith</h2><p>After the king of the failing kingdom gets an opportunity to see things through the traveler&#39;s spyglass, he gets a new perception of his world and starts to make the necessary changes to turn things around and make them better for his subjects.</p><p><b>Richard Paul Evans</b> is the author of <i>The Christmas Box, The Locket,</i> and other novels, as well as of the best-selling children's books <i>The Christmas Candle,</i> which was awarded the American Mothers 1998 Book of the Year Award, and <i>The Dance. The Spyglass</i> is the first book in his Virtues Collection. All of his children's book proceeds are donated to The Christmas Box House International.<p>K-Gr 5-This original fable offers a lesson about faith through the fall and rise of a kingdom. A once-great realm has declined into poverty, both of wealth and of spirit, until a passing stranger loans a magical spyglass to the king. Through it, the ruler and his subjects can see "what might be." A barren pasture appears as a fertile field and a crumbling cathedral looks magnificent when viewed through the spyglass. These images restore faith to the people, who then work together to restore the land to its past prosperity. The stately tone of the narrative keeps readers at a distance, inviting observation rather than true involvement. Children and adults will grasp the obvious message without difficulty, so when the stranger returns to explain the power of faith to the monarch, the revelation lacks impact. Handsome full-page oil paintings accompany the tale, though some figures appear posed and sterile, which adds to the artificiality of the story. Despite these limitations, The Spyglass does succeed as a discussion starter. Those who are looking for substantial storytelling will need to look elsewhere.-Steven Engelfried, Deschutes County Library, Bend, OR</p><p>Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>Built for Adventure: The Classic Automobiles of Clive Cussler and Dirk Pitt</h2><p><b>A photographic tour through Clive Cussler&#x2019;s outstanding collection of antique automobiles, including those featured in his #1 <i>New York Times</i>&nbsp;bestselling Dirk Pitt series.</b><br><br>Fans of Clive Cussler's bestselling Dirk Pitt series know that his hero has a soft spot for rare and classic automobiles...and that the vehicles that appear in the novels are actually part of Cussler's own vast collection.

But it&#x2019;s harder to understand why we can't seem to stop eating&#x2014;even when we know better. When we want so badly to say "no," why do we continue to reach for food? &nbsp;Dr. David Kessler, the dynamic former FDA commissioner who reinvented the food label and tackled the tobacco industry, now reveals how the food industry has hijacked the brains of millions of Americans. The result? America&#x2019;s number-one public health issue. Dr. Kessler cracks the code of overeating by explaining how our bodies and minds are changed when we consume foods that contain sugar, fat, and salt. Food manufacturers create products by manipulating these ingredients to stimulate our appetites, setting in motion a cycle of desire and consumption that ends with a nation of overeaters. <i>The End of Overeating</i> explains for the first time why it is exceptionally difficult to resist certain foods and why it&#x2019;s so easy to overindulge.&nbsp;Dr. Kessler met with top scientists, physicians, and food industry insiders. <i>The End of Overeating</i> uncovers the shocking facts about how we lost control over our eating habits&#x2014;and how we can get it back. Dr. Kessler presents groundbreaking research, along with what is sure to be a controversial view inside the industry that continues to feed a nation of overeaters&#x2014;from popular brand manufacturers to advertisers, chain restaurants, and fast food franchises.&nbsp;For the millions of people struggling with weight as well as for those of us who simply don't understand why we can't seem to stop eating our favorite foods, Dr. Kessler&#x2019;s cutting-edge investigation offers new insights and helpful tools to help us find a solution.&nbsp;There has never been a more thorough, compelling, or in-depth analysis of why we eat the way we do.</p><p>DAVID A.

America Gained Weight<br><br>For thousands of years human body weight stayed remarkably stable. Throughout adulthood we basically consumed no more than the food we needed to burn. People who were overweight stood apart from the general population. Millions of calories passed through our bodies, yet with rare exceptions our weight neither rose nor fell by any significant amount. A perfect biological system seemed to be at work.<br><br>Then, in the 1980s, something changed.<br><br>Katherine Flegal was one of the first to recognize the trend, but like many good researchers faced with an unexpected finding, she thought her numbers must be wrong. A senior research scientist at the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Flegal had been studying data from an enormous federal government survey of the health and nutritional status of American households. Her figures indicated that the number of people who were overweight had spiked dramatically.<br><br>Researchers had never seen such extreme numbers. In earlier decades, American adults typically gained a couple of ï¿½ds between the ages of twenty and forty and then lost a couple of ï¿½ds in their sixties and seventies.<br><br>The shift that riveted Katherine Flegal's attention came from government survey data collected from 1988 to 1991, which revealed that fully one- third of the population aged twenty to seventy-four weighed too much. In fewer than a dozen years, 8 percent more Americans--about 20 million people, roughly the population of New York State--had joined the ranks of the overweight.<br><br>Her training and professional experience had taught Flegal to be cautious. In a complex and ambitious survey, errors can creep in at many points, and data often show anomalies that disappear with further scrutiny. She knew her information had to be accurate before she sounded an alarm.<br><br>"We checked it to a fare-thee-well," she said, describing her research team's review of regional analyses, time trends, and quality- control techniques. Nothing seemed out of place. The evidence of an abrupt increase in the number of overweight Americans appeared to be valid.<br><br>Still, she was nervous, especially since no one else seemed particularly aware that Americans as a group were becoming heavier. Hoping to find studies confirming these provocative data, her team scoured the published literature, but few journal articles were relevant. At professional meetings Flegal casually asked other researchers what they thought was happening with weight in America. Most thought it was the same as it had always been.<br><br>Americans were gaining millions of extra ï¿½ds, yet at first these ï¿½ds remained invisible. The medical community, the scientific community, and the federal government were not quick to notice the trend.<br><br>And so Flegal's team wrote up its data and went to press. The study, published in the July 1994 issue of the Journal of the American Medical Association, reported that a comparison of current and earlier data on the weight of Americans had revealed "dramatic increases in all race/sex groups." When a respected academic journal calls something dramatic, it's the equivalent of a red alert. The results were consistent virtually across the board--among men and women, young and old, black and white. The rate of obesity in America had evidently exploded.<br><br>I asked Katherine Flegal to tell me how average weight had changed over time. Her graphs showed that the population had gotten bigger over the decades. In 1960, when weight was still relatively stable in America, women ages twenty to twenty-nine averaged about 128 ï¿½ds; by 2000, the average weight of women in that age group had reached 157.<br><br>A similar trend was apparent in the forty-to-forty-nine-year-old group, where the average weight had jumped from 142 ï¿½ds in 1960 to 169 in 2000.<br><br>Also striking was the evidence that we were entering our adult years at a significantly higher weight, reflecting the gains that had taken place during childhood and adolescence. And from age twenty to age forty, many of us kept gaining. Rather than a few ï¿½ds, the average adult man was gaining more than a dozen ï¿½ds in those years.<br><br>Flegal observed something else. While on average everyone was getting heavier, the heaviest people in the population were gaining disproportionately more weight than others. The spread between those at the upper end of the weight curve and those at the lower end was widening. Weight gain was primarily about overweight people becoming more overweight.<br><br>What had happened in such a short time to add so many millions of ï¿½ds to so many millions of people? Many years of research led me to an unexpected answer.<br><br>Certainly food had become more readily available in the 1970s and 1980s: We have larger portion sizes, more chain restaurants, more neighborhood food outlets, and a culture that promotes more out-of-home eating. But having food available doesn't mean we have to eat it. What's been driving us to overeat?<br><br>It is not a want born of fear that food shortages lie ahead. Once this had been so. In the Bible, seven years of plenty were inevitably followed by seven years of famine, so we needed to build storehouses of fat in preparation. But in America, where even northern supermarkets are filled with summer fruits much of the year, that logic doesn't apply.<br><br>Nor is it a want rooted in hunger or the love of exceptional food. That kind of logic is not what's driving the out-of-control eating we see in Sarah, Andrew, Claudia, and so many others like them.<br><br>We know, too, that overeating is not the sole province of those who are overweight. Even people who remain lean, like Samantha, feel embattled by their drive for food. For them, it takes the most determined restraint to resist what feels like an almost overpowering push to eat.<br><br>Little help has been available. Family members, friends, and colleagues have not had the knowledge to offer support. Many, including doctors and health care professionals, still think that weight gainers merely lack willpower, or perhaps self-esteem. Few medical personnel or nutritionists, few psychological experts or public health advocates, have recognized the distinctive pattern of overeating that has become widespread in the population. No one has seen loss of control as its most defining characteristic.<br><br>Those who have succumbed to the pull of food are spending billions of dollars in search of a cure, determined to rid their bodies of the burden of weight. But they are squandering most of their money, finding only short- term weight loss and a vain hope that it will last.<br><br>That is because we have not understood why eating certain foods only makes us want to eat more of them. No one has recognized what's really happening. Let me try to explain.</p><h2>Higglety Pigglety Pop! Or, There Must Be More to Life</h2><p>A daring imagination has woven a simple rhyme into a brilliantly original tale [about Jennie, the Sealyham terrier, who seeks Experience and becomes the star of the World Mother Goose Theatre].<p>Notable Children's Books of 1967 (ALA)<br>1968 Fanfare Honor List (H)<br>Best Books of 1967 (SLJ)<br>Children's Books of 1967 (Library of Congress) <br></p></p><p>As a tribute to his dearly departed pooch, Maurice Sendak wrote this odd little tale in 1967 about Jennie, a Sealyham terrier who is not content with having everything but must go out in the world to find something she doesn't have. Right off the bat, she comes across a pig wearing sandwich boards advertising the need for a leading lady in the World Mother Goose Theatre. Jennie leaps at the opportunity. Unfortunately, the position requires someone with experience, so she sets off to find it. One hungry lion and a stubborn un-hungry baby later, Jennie definitely has experience, if nothing else anymore, and off she goes to play the leading role in a nursery-rhyme-turned-theatrical-production: <blockquote> Higglety-pigglety pop!<br> The dog has eaten the mop!<br> The pig's in a hurry<br> The cat's in a flurry<br> Higglety-pigglety pop!<br> </blockquote> This dreamy, slightly dark story, illustrated in Sendak's renowned pen-and-ink style, tells of a gluttonous dog's transformation from someone who cares only about her next salami sandwich to one who would risk her life for a weaker being (while still wondering where that next sandwich is coming from). Caldecott Medal artist Sendak is the brilliantly quirky creator of such classics as <i>Where the Wild Things Are</i> and <i>In the Night Kitchen</i>.

He decribes pagan oracles, festivals, and cultic practices as they related to civic and community life in third-century Roman Empire; then, comparing these with Christian practices, he discusses the possible reasons for Christianity's ultimate triumph. Along the way, certain misconceptions are dispelled: Roman paganism was not dying out, as is sometimes supposed, nor was early Christianity primarily a religion of slaves. In fact, the Church had elements that made it unexpectedly attractive to all classes. The chapter on Constantine gives new insight into the reasons for his conversion. An excellent and readable account of a fascinating subject. Highly recommended. C.

Guardian journalist Jon Ronson&#39;s Them began as a book about different kinds of extremists, but after Jon had got to know some of them - Islamic fundamentalists, neo-Nazis, Ku Klux Klansmen - he found that they had one oddly similar belief: that a tiny, shadowy elite rule the world from a secret room. In Them, Jon sets out, with the help of the extremists, to locate that room. The journey is as creepy as it is comic, and along the way Jon is chased by men in dark glasses, unmasked as a Jew in the middle of a Jihad training camp, and witnesses international CEOs and politicians participate in a bizarre pagan ritual in the forests of northern California. Them is a fascinating and entertaining exploration of extremism, in which Jon learns some alarming things about the looking-glass world of &#39;them&#39; and &#39;us&#39;. Are the extremists on to something? Or has Jon become one of them?</p><p>In <i>Them</i>, British humorist Jon Ronson relates his misadventures as he engages an assortment of theorists and activists residing on the fringes of the political, religious, and sociological spectrum. His subjects include Omar Bakri Mohammed, the point man for a holy war against Britain (Ronson paints him as a wily buffoon); a hypocritical but engaging Ku Klux Klan leader; participants in the Ruby Ridge and Waco, Texas, battles; the Irish Protestant firebrand Ian Paisley; and David Ickes, who believes that the semi-human descendants of evil extraterrestrial 12-foot-tall lizards walk among us. Despite these characters' disparities, they are bound by a belief in the Bilderberg Group, the "secret rulers of the world." In a final chapter, Ronson manages, with surprising ease, to penetrate these rulers' very lair. He writes with wry, faux-naive wit and eschews didacticism, instead letting his subjects' words and actions speak for themselves. <i>--H.

Forstchen have turned their sharp eye for detail on the Revolutionary War. Their story follows three men with three very different roles to play in history: General George Washington, Thomas Paine, and Jonathan Van Dorn, a private in Washington&#x2019;s army. The action focuses on one of the most iconic events in American history: Washington cross - ing the Delaware. Unlike the bold, courageous General in Emanuel Leutze&#x2019;s painting, Washington is full of doubt on the night of December 25, 1776. After five months of defeat, morale is dangerously low. Each morning muster shows that hundreds have deserted in the night. While Washington prepares his weary troops for the attack on Trenton, Thomas Paine is in Philadelphia, overseeing the printing of his newest pamphlet, <i>The Crisis</i>. And Jonathan Van Dorn is about to bring the war to his own doorstep. In the heat of battle, he must decide between staying loyal to the cause and sparing his brother who has joined up with the British. Through the thoughts and private fears of these three men, Gingrich and Forstchen illu minate the darkest days of the Revolution. With detailed research and an incredible depth of military insight, this novel provides a rare and personal perspective of the men who fought for, and founded the United States of America. <p></p></p><p>NEWT GINGRICH, former Speaker of the House, is the author of several bestselling books, including <i>Pearl Harbor </i>and <i>Gettysburg</i>.

His woolen cape was soaked through, water coursing down his neck, his uniform already clammy. Though his knee- high boots were of the fi nest calfskin, they were soaked as well and his pants sopping wet halfway up the thigh as a result of his having slipped several times walking along the banks of the flood- swollen Delaware River. Another gust of wind out of the east kicked up spray that stung his face, and he turned his back as it swept by, roaring through the treetops and up the ridge on the Pennsylvania side of the river.</p><p>&#x201c;This damn storm will play hell with moving the artillery across.&#x201d; General George Washington, commander of what had once been so valiantly called the Continental Army of the United States of America, turned toward the speaker, his artillery chief, Colonel Henry Knox. Rotund at what had to be three hundred pounds and powerful looking, towering several inches over Washington&#x2019;s six foot, two inches, the artilleryman was shivering, his spectacles misted by the rain. Knox looked pathetic, this bookseller turned warrior who should have been in his store in Boston, resting by a crackling fire rather than out on an evening such as this.</p><p>&#x201c;They&#x2019;ll cross. They have to cross,&#x201d; Washington replied calmly. &#x201c;This wind is just as cold for the Hessians as it is for us. They may not be very good at picketing in this kind of storm.&#x201d; He wondered if Knox and the others gathered nearby, Generals Stirling and Greene, their orderlies and staff, were waiting for the most obvious of orders on a night like this, just waiting for him to sigh and say, &#x201c;Return the men to their encampments.&#x201d; He shook his head, shoulders hunched against the spates of rain, which were turning to sleet.</p><p>He looked across the river, to the east, to the Jersey shore. In his haunted memories, memories that did indeed haunt, he could see that other river bordering New Jersey sixty miles to the east . . . the Hudson, and just beyond the Hudson . . . the East River. Merciful God, was it but five months ago we were arrayed there in our proud defiance? Another gust swept across the Delaware, but this time he did not turn away from it.</p><p>How hot it had been during those days of August. How proud we were. How proud and confident I was, he thought. He shook his head at the memory of it. Our victory at Boston and the British withdrawal from that port had misled all of us into an absurd overconfidence. We had marched to New York in anticipation of the next British move with the satisfaction of having driven off the army of the most powerful country in the world and were expecting to do so again with ease.</p><p>On the very day that the Declaration was read publicly for the first time, the vanguard of King George&#x2019;s reply was coasting Long Island, bearing toward New York&#x2019;s outer harbor. He had second- guessed the move months before, and so had moved his army, fresh from their triumph at Boston, on the long march south to defend New York. Filled with confidence, so many had boasted that if the British and their hireling Germans, commonly called Hessians, did attempt to return there, this new army of America would make short work of them.</p><p>Arriving in New York the Continentals had set to work with vigor, building bastions, fortifications, and strong points, ringing the harbor with hundreds of guns and near to thirty thousand troops. Most of the troops he had commanded during the long siege of Boston had been New Englanders. It had been a difficult command and one, at first, not easily accepted. The men of Massachusetts felt one of their own should be in command, for, after all, was it not their state that had stood up first, and was it not their state where the battle was being fought? It had taken the utmost of tact to manage them in a situation that would have caused any regular officer of the British army to howl with rage or derision or both. Yet manage them he did, slowly earning their begrudging respect.</p><p>As they set to work building their fortifications around New York Harbor, reinforcements flooded in from the other states, transforming the army. There were tough backwoodsmen from the frontiers of Pennsylvania, western New York, Virginia, and the Carolinas joining spit- and- polish regiments from the tidewater of Chesapeake Bay and unruly militia by the thousands from Jersey, lower New York, and Connecticut.</p><p>His army swelled until there were more men than the entire population of Philadelphia, America&#x2019;s most populous city. The worry then, added to when the invasion would strike, was simply keeping so many men fed, housed, and healthy and not at each other&#x2019;s throats. As to the feeding and housing, the need had been met, for the countryside was rich; supplies could be floated down the Hudson Valley and drawn in from the fertile Jersey countryside. As to health, that soon broke down as it would in almost any army that stayed in camp. Smallpox struck thousands, and hundreds perished, but such was to be expected even in the best tended of armies. As to stopping the men from going at each other&#x2019;s throats, that had proven near impossible at times.</p><p>Though he would never admit it within the hearing of a single living soul, the New Englanders struck him as a haughty and ill- bred lot, lacking in the refinements a gentleman planter of Virginia expected of them. He was not the only person in the command to carry such feelings, and nearly all others expressed them openly, vocally, and at times violently. He actually started to pray that the British would return, and soon, for, if not, the army might very well rend itself apart. And they had come, as if in answer to that prayer, and proved reality a curse. In the first week of July the vanguard appeared; in the next weeks, more and yet more&#x2014; ships of the line, frigates, fast sloops and brigs, supply ships&#x2014; and then the transports brought regiment after regiment of En gland&#x2019;s finest. How ironic that with each passing day he could ride down to the narrows between Long Island and Staten Island and with telescope watch the ranks disembarking onto Staten Island. Regimental standards he remembered with such admiration from the last war floated on the breeze, and when the wind came from the west he could even hear their bands playing.

As head of the Los Alamos Laboratory, he oversaw the successful effort to beat the Nazis in the race to develop the first atomic bomb&#x2014;a breakthrough that was to have eternal ramifications for mankind and that made Oppenheimer the &#x201c;Father of the Atomic Bomb.&#x201d; But with his actions leading up to that great achievement, he also set himself on a dangerous collision course with Senator Joseph McCarthy and his witch-hunters. In <i>Robert Oppenheimer: A Life Inside the Center</i>, Ray Monk, author of peerless biographies of Ludwig Wittgenstein and Bertrand Russell, goes deeper than any previous biographer in the quest to solve the enigma of Oppenheimer&#x2019;s motivations and his complex personality. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The son of German-Jewish immigrants, Oppenheimer was a man of phenomenal intellectual attributes, driven by an ambition to overcome his status as an outsider and penetrate the heart of political and social life. As a young scientist, his talent and drive allowed him to enter a community peopled by the great names of twentieth-century physics&#x2014;men such as Niels Bohr, Max Born, Paul Dirac, and Albert Einstein&#x2014;and to play a role in the laboratories and classrooms where the world was being changed forever, where the secrets of the universe, whether within atomic nuclei or collapsing stars, revealed themselves.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But Oppenheimer&#x2019;s path went beyond one of assimilation, scientific success, and world fame. The implications of the discoveries at Los Alamos weighed heavily upon this fragile and complicated man. In the 1930s, in a climate already thick with paranoia and espionage, he made suspicious connections, and in the wake of the Allied victory, his attempts to resist the escalation of the Cold War arms race led many to question his loyalties.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Through compassionate investigation and with towering scholarship, Ray Monk&#x2019;s <i>Robert Oppenheimer</i> tells an unforgettable story of discovery, secrecy, impossible choices, and unimaginable destruction.</p><p>RAY MONK is the author of <i>Ludwig Wittgenstein: The Duty of Genius</i>, for which he was awarded the John Llewellyn Rhys Prize and the Duff Cooper Prize, and a two-volume biography of Bertrand Russell. He is Professor of Philosophy at the University of Southampton.<i>Excerpted from the Hardcover edition<br></i><br><br>1<br><br>&#x201c;Amerika, du hast es besser &#x201d;:<br><br>Oppenheimer&#x2019;s German Jewish Background<br><br>J. Robert Oppenheimer, his friend Isidor Rabi once remarked, was &#x201c;a man who was put together of many bright shining splinters,&#x201d; who &#x201c;never got to be an integrated personality.&#x201d; What prevented Oppenheimer from being fully integrated, Rabi thought, was his denial of a centrally important part of himself: his Jewishness. As the physicist Felix Bloch, echoing Rabi, once put it, Oppenheimer &#x201c;tried to act as if he were not a Jew and succeeded well because he was a good actor.&#x201d; And, because he was always acting (&#x201c;you carried on a charade with him. He lived a charade,&#x201d; Rabi once remarked), he lost sight of who he really was. Oppenheimer had an impressive and wide-ranging collection of talents, abilities and personal characteristics, but where the central, united core of his personality ought to have been, Rabi thought, there was a gap and so there was nothing to hold those &#x201c;bright shining splinters&#x201d; together. &#x201c;I understood his problem,&#x201d; Rabi said, and, when asked what that problem was, replied simply: &#x201c;Identity.&#x201d;<br><br>Rabi spoke as someone who, by virtue of his background, intelligence and education, was well placed to understand Oppenheimer&#x2019;s &#x201c;problem.&#x201d; He and Oppenheimer had a great deal in common: they were roughly the same age (Rabi was six years older), they were both theoretical physicists, were both brought up in New York City and were both descended from European Jewish families. Behind this last similarity, however, lay a fundamental difference. Rabi was proud of his Jewish inheritance and happy to define himself in terms of it. Though he had no religious beliefs, and never prayed, he once said that when he saw Orthodox Jews at prayer, the thought that came into his mind was: &#x201c;These are my people.&#x201d;<br><br>No such thought could have entered Oppenheimer&#x2019;s mind, no matter who he was looking at. There was no group to whom he could point and say, &#x201c;These are my people,&#x201d; and not just because of his ambivalence about his Jewish background. It was also because that background itself, regardless of Oppenheimer&#x2019;s feelings about it, could not have provided him with the sense of belonging and, therefore, the sense of identity that Rabi thought was missing in him. Rabi, despite his lack of religious beliefs, was Jewish in a fairly straightforward and unambiguous way; the Jews simply were &#x201c;his people.&#x201d; Theirs was the community to which he belonged. One cannot say the same about Oppenheimer. The sense in which he was Jewish, the sense in which he did--and did not--come from, and belong to, a Jewish community, is far more complicated and, as Rabi has perceptively noted, crucial in understanding the fragility of his sense of identity.<br><br>For an understanding of the elusive nature of Oppenheimer&#x2019;s Jewishness, the contrast between his family background and Rabi&#x2019;s is instructive. Despite their many and important similarities, and despite the fact that they grew up within a few miles of each other, Rabi and Oppenheimer were born into and brought up in families that were culturally worlds apart. Rabi was a &#x201c;Polish Jew.&#x201d; Born in Galicia to a poor, Yiddish-speaking family of Orthodox Jews, he came to New York as an infant and was raised, first in the crowded slums of the Lower East Side and then in a tiny apartment in Brooklyn. Oppenheimer was born not in Europe, but in New York City, to a wealthy family that had abandoned its Jewish faith and traditions a generation earlier. The bustling and crowded &#x201c;Jewish Ghetto&#x201d; of the Lower East Side would have seemed utterly alien to the young Oppenheimer, who was brought up in an enormous luxury apartment in the genteel Upper West Side. The family had never spoken Yiddish, and, though German was his father&#x2019;s first language, it was never spoken at home.<br><br>And yet, despite regarding himself as neither German nor Jewish, Oppenheimer was seen, by Jews and non-Jews alike, as a &#x201c;German Jew.&#x201d; In New York in the early twentieth century the central division among the Jewish community was between, on the one hand, the German Jews and, on the other, the Polish and Russian Jews--the differences between the two groups accurately mirrored by the differences between Oppenheimer and Rabi. The German Jews, sometimes called &#x201c;Uptown Jews,&#x201d; were on the whole wealthier, more assimilated and less religious than their Polish and Russian counterparts, to whom they were notoriously condescending. At the time of Oppenheimer&#x2019;s birth in 1904 there were more Polish and Russian Jews in New York than German Jews, but the Germans assumed leadership of the Jewish community and took it upon themselves to help &#x201c;Americanize&#x201d; the Russians and Poles, who reacted with resentment at what they saw as a dismissal of their religion and their customs.<br><br>What Rabi called Oppenheimer&#x2019;s problem--the problem of identity--was, in fact, a problem for the entire American Jewish community, perhaps its central problem. Certainly it was the issue at the heart of the tension between the two groups of Jews in New York City. For the Russian and Polish Jews, their sense of identity was bound up with their Jewishness: their Orthodox religious beliefs, their Yiddish language and their Jewish culture and traditions. That sense of identity, that culture, however, had been abandoned by the German Jews before they even came to America.<br><br>The mass migration of German Jews to America that occurred in the mid-nineteenth century was intimately bound up with their earlier abandonment of the traditional trappings of Jewish identity. Haskalah, the Jewish Enlightenment of the late eighteenth century, was an essentially German movement, its prophet being the great Prussian Jewish thinker Moses Mendelssohn. Haskalah, which led in turn to that other essentially German movement, Reform Judaism, encouraged Jews to, literally and metaphorically, leave the ghettos in which they had been confined and embrace the modernizing ideas of the wider Western European Enlightenment. This meant using German rather than Hebrew as the language of worship, abandoning traditions and customs that served to isolate Jews from the rest of society, and reforming Jewish education so that it prepared people for the world at large rather than schooling them in a separate culture. The hope that inspired these changes was that, in return for abandoning those aspects of their culture that identified them as radically different from others, the Jews would receive from the gentile world a lifting of the discriminatory laws that affected almost every aspect of their lives, and a full acceptance as members of society with the same legal, financial and political rights as other citizens. Thus fully assimilated, Jews would no longer think of themselves as a separate race or nation, but rather as adherents of a religion. Their nationality would be German, and they would be not a bit less German for worshipping in a synagogue rather than a church.<br><br>It was the dashing of this hope that persuaded hundreds of thousands of German Jews in the middle decades of the nineteenth century to turn their backs on their home country and look to America--a country founded upon the proposition that the equality of all men and the inalienability of the right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness were self-evident truths--to find the freedom and equality they had failed to achieve in Germany. Thus, in the eyes of German Jews, America became not only a refuge from discrimination and prejudice, but also the national embodiment of Enlightenment ideals, the ideals of Haskalah. Many of them therefore ceased trying to become accepted as Germans and sought instead to become accepted as Americans.<br><br>&#x201c;Amerika, du hast es besser.&#x201d; These famous words of Goethe are contained in the poem &#x201c;Den Vereinigten Staaten&#x201d; (&#x201c;To the United States&#x201d;), written in 1827, when, as an old man, he reflected upon the advantages that youthful America had over the &#x201c;Old Continent&#x201d; in having no tradition, no &#x201c;decaying castles,&#x201d; and being therefore free from the continuous strife that comes from long memories. The image of America that Goethe&#x2019;s poem conjures up is one of a tabula rasa, waiting, so to speak, to have its history written upon it. This was an image perfectly suited to arouse the interest and expectations of the German Jews, a group who longed to start afresh, free from the tensions and prejudices of the past.<br><br>And so, beginning in the 1820s, the rallying cry &#x201c;On to America&#x201d; echoed throughout the Jewish community in Germany. A whole movement grew up dedicated to the encouragement of migration to the United States, publicizing the financial, social and political advantages of the New World, and providing hope and support to those prepared to make what must have been an alarming as well as an exciting fresh start. In books by Europeans who had been to America, in letters to relatives from those who had migrated, and in village meetings where people gathered to hear firsthand accounts of American life from migrants who had returned to visit families, the image of America as &#x201c;the common man&#x2019;s utopia&#x201d; was spread, inspiring more and more Jews to set sail for the United States.<br><br>A typical example of such inspirational firsthand accounts is a letter written in November 1846 by the journalist and academic Max Lilienthal, which was published in the German Jewish weekly newspaper Allgemeine Zeitung des Judenthums. Extolling &#x201c;the beautiful ground of civil equality&#x201d; that he had discovered in America, Lilienthal announced: &#x201c;The old Europe with its restrictions lies behind me like a bad dream . . . At last I breathe in liberty . . . Jew or Christian, Christian or Jew--this old strife is forgotten, and only the man as such is respected and loved.&#x201d; Encouraging others to follow his example, he urged: &#x201c;Shake off the centuries-old dust of Jew-pressure . . . become a human being like everybody else.&#x201d; And, he promised, in America: &#x201c;Jewish hearts are open in welcome. Jewish organisations ready to help anyone. Why should you go on carrying the burden of legal exclusion?&#x201d;<br><br>The number of German Jews willing and eager to &#x201c;shake off the centuries-old dust of Jew-pressure&#x201d; was so large that it completely transformed the American Jewish community. In 1840, there were just 15,000 Jews in the United States; by 1880, there were 280,000, most of whom were of German origin. This influx of German Jews is known to Jewish historians as the &#x201c;Second Migration&#x201d;--the &#x201c;First Migration&#x201d; being the arrival in the seventeenth century of a small community of Sephardic Jews. These were descendants of the Jews expelled from Spain and Portugal in the fifteenth century, who, by the nineteenth century, were a well-established part of American life.<br><br>These self-styled &#x201c;old American Sephardic families&#x201d; took pride in the fact that they had been in America for as many generations as the descendants of the Pilgrim Fathers, and tended to treat the new German arrivals with the kind of lofty disdain with which the German Jews would later treat the Russians and Poles. The first German Jews to arrive in America accepted the leadership of the old Sephardic community and even adopted the Sephardic form of worship. When the number of German Jewish migrants began to increase dramatically, however, the balance of power shifted and the German, Ashkenazi Jews replaced the Sephardim as the leaders of the American Jewish community.<br><br>The mass influx into America of Russian and Polish Jews, which took place from 1880 to 1920, formed the &#x201c;Third Migration,&#x201d; and was on an entirely different scale from the previous two, being measured not in tens of thousands, or in hundreds of thousands, but in millions. Roughly two and a half million Jews from Eastern Europe arrived in the United States during the Third Migration, bringing with them a very different kind of Jewish culture from that of either the Sephardim or the Germans.<br><br>The arrival of these Russian and Polish Jews was such an embarrassment to the established German Jewish community that their first reaction to it was to argue, through editorials in their newspaper, American Hebrew, and direct lobbying from their organization, the United Hebrew Charities of New York, for the introduction of tougher immigration laws. When this came to nothing and the number of Eastern European Jewish immigrants kept rising, the German Jews set up the Education Alliance, which organized Americanization programs in which the new immigrants were instructed in &#x201c;the privileges and duties of American citizenship.&#x201d; What drove these measures was not only the German Jews&#x2019; love of America, but also a dread of the anti-Semitism which they feared the Eastern European Jews would arouse. The Jewish historian Gerald Sorin points out: &#x201c;These uptowners were very taken with Israel Zangwill&#x2019;s play &#x2018;The Melting Pot.&#x2019; They saw in it a reinforcement of their own proposed solution for the problems of downtown: the sooner immigrants from eastern Europe gave up their cultural distinctiveness and melted into the homogenized mass, the sooner anti-Semitism would also melt.&#x201d;<br><br>It was a strategy that German Jews had tried unsuccessfully in Germany, but which seemed to be working in the United States. It required, however, constant vigilance with respect to &#x201c;cultural distinctiveness,&#x201d; a vigilance that could easily slip into the kind of self-denial of which Rabi accused Oppenheimer. One form this vigilance took was an acute sensitivity among German Jews about their names. Sometimes this led to the abandonment of German-sounding surnames, a notable example being August Schonberg, the son of an impoverished Jewish family from the Rhineland, who would become famous as the millionaire New York banker August Belmont. More often, though, it took the form of changing one&#x2019;s first name and giving to one&#x2019;s children names that sounded reassuringly &#x201c;American.&#x201d; Joseph Seligman, another millionaire New York banker, brought his brothers, Wolfgang, Jacob and Isaias, over from Germany, but on arrival they became William, James and Jesse. The names of Joseph Seligman&#x2019;s children look like a roll call of American heroes: George Washington Seligman, Edwin Robert Anderson Seligman and Alfred Lincoln Seligman (evidently &#x201c;Abraham&#x201d; was considered too Judaic).<br><br>Of the American heroes commemorated in these names, the least well known today is undoubtedly Robert Anderson. He was a major in the U.S. army at the time of the outbreak of the Civil War in April 1861 and was involved in the opening hostilities, when Fort Sumter in South Carolina, which was then under his command, came under fire from the Confederates. For holding his ground and defending the fort for thirty-four hours Major Anderson was promoted by Abraham Lincoln to Brigadier General and became a national hero, not just for the duration of the war, but also for many decades afterward. Because of him, the name &#x201c;Robert&#x201d; became immensely popular. For anyone wanting to affirm the American identity of their offspring, it was the natural choice. Indeed J. Robert Oppenheimer was to like it so much that he ignored the &#x201c;J&#x201d; in his name and was known, by family and friends, simply as &#x201c;Robert&#x201d; or &#x201c;Bob.&#x201d; When he was asked what the &#x201c;J&#x201d; stood for, he would reply that it stood for nothing. In fact, as his birth certificate shows, it stands for &#x201c;Julius,&#x201d; his father&#x2019;s name. For anyone striving to avoid &#x201c;cultural distinctiveness,&#x201d; the name &#x201c;Robert Oppenheimer,&#x201d; or even &#x201c;J. Robert Oppenheimer,&#x201d; had obvious advantages over &#x201c;Julius Oppenheimer.&#x201d;</p><h2>Secrets of the Soil: A Fascinating Account of Recent Breakthroughs- Scientific and Spiritual- That Can Save Your Garden or Farm</h2><p>Explores scientific and mystical developments that renew and enhance the soil, among them rock dust fertilizer, biodynamic agriculture, and other highly unusual fertilizers</p><p>To those who practice it, biodynamic agriculture is almost a religion, in which Rudolph Steiner serves as high priest, his Agricultural Lectures as bible. Steiner's dubious faith calls for packing manure into cow horns, burying it for a specified period, then digging up the mixture and diluting it to manufacture a spray that apparently eliminates chemical poisons commonly added to the soil. Tompkins and Bird, coauthors of The Secret Life of Plants , cite the work of scientists and philosophers such as Steiner to support their extravagant claims; they report on the special qualities of glacial water and efforts to produce it in the laboratory, and tell of a plant breeder who believes that birdsong, music and a natural foliar fertilizer can stimulate plant growth ("sonic bloom"). Such exotic journeys into the fringes of agriculture, best appreciated by true believers, make ordinary organic farming and integrated pest management, though perhaps more effective, seem positively mundane.

The book is full of references to clairvoyancy, pyramid power, and other such stuff.

Whether she is deadheading flowers or glorying in the profusion of roses, offering sugar water to a hummingbird or studying the slug, she welcomes the unexpected drama and extravagance as well as the sanctuary her garden offers. She chronicles instances of violence in nature but also intuits loneliness and desire in the clamor of male crickets in the spring. And there is wonderment and marvel as she happens upon a tiny frog asleep inside the petals of a tulip. Visitors to her garden range from botanical explorers of earlier centuries to the nature mystic John Muir to the brilliant British garden writer Gertrude Jekyll.</p><p>The author's garden nourishes its creator, who imaginatively returns the favor and seizes privileged moments to leap from science and metaphor to meditation on the human condition. Written in sensuous, lyrical prose,<em> Cultivating Delight</em> is a hymn to nature and to the pleasure we take in it.</p></p><p>Diane Ackerman relishes the world of her garden. As a poet, she finds within it an endless field of metaphors. As a naturalist, she notices each small, miraculous detail: the hummingbirds and their routines, the showy tulips, the crazy yellow forsythia. Of visiting deer she writes, "I love watching the deer, which always arrive like magic or a miracle or the answer to an unasked question."<p> In her popular book <i>A Natural History of the Senses</i>, Ackerman celebrates the human body; in <i>A Natural History of My Garden</i>, she turns her attention to the world outside the body, outside the human sphere. Structured by seasons, this is a book of subtle shifts, but the reader never feels lost. Her prose is so welcoming, at times it feels like she's talking directly to you, although her lush, poetic language is the opposite of speech.</p><p> Distracted urban readers craving a book that will transport them would do well to spend time immersed in these pages, as will gardeners who've lost appreciation for their plot. Ackerman is a generous writer--a teacher who will share treasured, obscure passages from Beckett or Hawthorne. She's emotional and highly charged, and her descriptions are so clear they're small marvels. She's remarkable for her ability to find mystery everywhere. <i>--Emily White</i></p><p>Poet, essayist, and naturalist, Diane Ackerman is the author of many highly acclaimed works of nonfiction, including <em>A Natural History of the Senses</em> -- a book beloved by readers all over the worldand the volumes <em>Deep Play, A Slender Thread, The Rarest of the Rare, A Natural History of Love, The Moon by Whale Light,</em> and a memoir on flying, <em>On Extended Wings.</em></p><p>Her poetry has been collected into six volumes, among them <em>Jaguar of Sweet Laughter: New and Selected Poems</em> and, most recently, <em>Praise My Destroyer.</em></p><p>Ms. Ackerman has received many prizes and awards, including the John Burroughs Nature Award and the Lavan Poetry Prize.

The geologic features found in our national parks are a testimony to the Earth&#x2019;s complexity and dynamic nature; a planet that has been in a continuous state of change since its origin 4.6 billion years ago.

Set against the looming horrors of the battlefield&#x2014;weary, demoralized men marching in the rain during the German attack on Caporetto; the profound struggle between loyalty and desertion&#x2014;this gripping, semiautobiographical work captures the harsh realities of war and the pain of lovers caught in its inexorable sweep. <br><br>Ernest Hemingway famously said that he rewrote the ending to <i>A Farewell to Arms </i>thirty-nine times to get the words right. This edition collects all of the alternative endings together for the first time, along with early drafts of other essential passages, offering new insight into Hemingway&#x2019;s craft and creative process and the evolution of one of the greatest novels of the twentieth century. Featuring Hemingway&#x2019;s own 1948 introduction to an illustrated reissue of the novel, a personal foreword by the author&#x2019;s son Patrick Hemingway, and a new introduction by the author&#x2019;s grandson Seï¿½n Hemingway, this edition of <i>A Farewell to Arms </i>is truly a celebration.</p><p>As a youth of 18, Ernest Hemingway was eager to fight in the Great War. Poor vision kept him out of the army, so he joined the ambulance corps instead and was sent to France. Then he transferred to Italy where he became the first American wounded in that country during World War I. Hemingway came out of the European battlefields with a medal for valor and a wealth of experience that he would, 10 years later, spin into literary gold with <i>A Farewell to Arms</i>. This is the story of Lieutenant Henry, an American, and Catherine Barkley, a British nurse. The two meet in Italy, and almost immediately Hemingway sets up the central tension of the novel: the tenuous nature of love in a time of war. During their first encounter, Catherine tells Henry about her fiancï¿½ of eight years who had been killed the year before in the Somme. Explaining why she hadn't married him, she says she was afraid marriage would be bad for him, then admits: <blockquote> I wanted to do something for him. You see, I didn't care about the other thing and he could have had it all. He could have had anything he wanted if I would have known. I would have married him or anything. I know all about it now. But then he wanted to go to war and I didn't know. </blockquote> The two begin an affair, with Henry quite convinced that he "did not love Catherine Barkley nor had any idea of loving her. This was a game, like bridge, in which you said things instead of playing cards." Soon enough, however, the game turns serious for both of them and ultimately Henry ends up deserting to be with Catherine. <p> Hemingway was not known for either unbridled optimism or happy endings, and <i>A Farewell to Arms</i>, like his other novels (<i>For Whom the Bell Tolls</i>, <i>The Sun Also Rises</i>, and <i>To Have and Have Not</i>), offers neither. What it <i>does</i> provide is an unblinking portrayal of men and women behaving with grace under pressure, both physical and psychological, and somehow finding the courage to go on in the face of certain loss. <i>--Alix Wilber</i></p>6 1.5-hour cassettes</p><h2>Biochemistry (Lippincott&#39;s Illustrated Reviews)</h2><p><i>Lippincott&#x2019;s Illustrated Reviews: Biochemistry</i> is the long-established first-and best resource for the essentials of biochemistry.

Narrated by an unheroic, apparently rudderless hero named Random, Smollett&#39;s wildly energetic and entertaining novel is held together not least by the narrator&#39;s outrage and dismay. Although Roderick Random was first published anonymously, the secret of Smollett&#39;s authorship was soon discovered, with the result that many readers thought they recognized similarities between the life of the hero and that of his creator. Certainly Roderick Random&#39;s early years - disinherited and without wealth and influence - and his university career, apprenticeship and service as a naval surgeon, vividly reflect the experiences of the author. How Random learns to survive the fickle hand of fortune, recovers his long-lost father, marries his beloved Narcissa, and dispatches his enemies is the stuff, not of autobiography but of a novel which profoundly satirizes the moral chaos of its times. Dickens and Thackeray, among other great Victorians, applauded Smollett for his wit and invention, and in Roderick Random we enjoy the novel of a pioneer opening up the frontiers of fiction.<br><strong>Anthony Trollope</strong> (24 April 1815- 6 December 1882) was one of the most successful, prolific and respected English novelists of the Victorian era.

This volume brings together the uncollected short fiction of the poet, writer and religious philosopher Aleister Crowley (1875 1947). Crowley was a successful critic, editor and author of fiction from 1908 to 1922, and his short stories are long overdue for discovery. Of the forty-nine stories in the present volume, only thirty were published in his lifetime. Most of the rest appear here for the first time. Like their author, Crowley s stories are fun, smart, witty, thought-provoking and sometimes unsettling. They are set in places he had lived and knew well: Belle Epoque Paris, Edwardian London, pre-revolutionary Russia and America during the first World War. The title story The Drug stands as one of the first if not the first accounts of a psychedelic experience. His Black and Silver is a knowing early noir discovery that anticipates an entire genre. Atlantis is a masterpiece of occult fantasy, a dark satire that can stand with Samuel Butler s Erewhon. Frank Harris considered The Testament of Magdalen Blair the most terrifying tale ever written.

She lives on a secluded mountaintop avocado ranch in a 30&#39; travel trailer with her dog, Rose.Writing The Tiny Mess got us all thinking about the evolution of our own little kitchens. We&nbsp;haven&#x2019;t always lived in teeny, tiny, unconventional homes, so adapting to a life of less space has&nbsp;most certainly been an evolution for the three of us. We have come a long way from our big, old,&nbsp;cluttered spaces full of useless junk to our small, cluttered spaces full of wonderfully useful&nbsp;junk.<br><br>Perhaps you and your living space have had a similar journey into the abyss of extreme downsizing.&nbsp;Perhaps it went something like this:<br><br>You started with about eight plates, a dozen mugs, pots and pans in every size, and a plethora of&nbsp;tools and gadgets. You thought you would really need that apple corer, egg slicer, and avocado&nbsp;keeper. There&#x2019;d be room for them, you said. You had already gotten rid of so much stuff, you said.&nbsp;But then you spent that first month in your new home&#x2014; navigating your way around your new&nbsp;microsized kitchen, organizing Tupperware like Tetris blocks, and realizing all over again, every&nbsp;single day, that you still have too . . . much . . . shit.<br><br>So for your next move, you gutted the kitchen and tossed everything that doesn&#x2019;t fold, stack, stow,&nbsp;or nest. You knocked out some built-ins or ripped out a wall and added some extra countertop. You&nbsp;reanalyzed your inventory and decided to keep only two of everything you eat on or with. Nothing&nbsp;more. You decided you&#x2019;ll be making cowboy coffee from now on. No need for that electric&nbsp;coffeemaker, pointless! Cowboy coffee it is.<br><br>Finally, you have space. Real room to breathe. Unfortunately, your kitchen now looks like the&nbsp;inside of a camping store. You want to have friends over, but they&#x2019;d have to eat with sporks, so&nbsp;you get a couple more plate settings, ditch the enamel mugs that burn your lips, and buy a&nbsp;pour-over coffeemaker because good coffee is something you are unwilling to sacrifice. You acquire&nbsp;a cast-iron skillet because it does nearly everything you could ever ask&nbsp; a pan to do, and like a&nbsp;well-seasoned pair of old Levi&#x2019;s, it doesn&#x2019;t really need washing. That sleek multitool utility&nbsp;knife contraption goes back into your camping kit and instead you find yourself one decent, sharp&nbsp;knife that cuts anything. You part with the color-coded cutting boards and replace them with a lone&nbsp;burly wood board, one that will get funkier and funkier with each meal and fits perfectly over your&nbsp;sink.<br><br>Substance over style. Function as a part of form. Simpler. Slower. You are getting the hang of it&nbsp;now.<br><br>Perhaps the hardest thing of all during this process is learning how to accept various gifts from&nbsp;well-meaning parents, family, and friends. You know&#x2014;those completely incompetent small versions of&nbsp;normal tools or some gimmicky ceramic measuring cups that don&#x2019;t even say the damn measurements on&nbsp;them. The people in your life are so excited for you and want to support you, so in the end, you&nbsp;wind up with a special place somewhere in your tiny home for all these mostly pointless gifts&nbsp;because you love the folks who gifted them to you. Sound familiar?<br>Well, that&#x2019;s because we have been there, too. The three of us have all gone mad with the work of&nbsp;trying to live smaller so that we can lead bigger, more enriching lives. We&#x2019;ve plotted and planned,&nbsp;reworked, reconfigured, and redone things a thousand times in our pursuit of a better kitchen,&nbsp;easier cooking, and tastier food. It hasn&#x2019;t been easy, but it has made us wildly more efficient,&nbsp;creative cooks who continue to grow with every obstacle.<br>Our pantries are filled with food, not appliances. Our cupboards are full of spices and sketchy&nbsp;condiments that most everyone else refrigerates. Our fridges might technically be coolers, but they&nbsp;are packed exclusively with perishables because that&#x2019;s all we have room for. Our counters are&nbsp;stained with stories of meals gone by and roads long since traveled.<br><br>And you know what? These are good things. These are things that we are proud of. These are things&nbsp;we continue to work on every day. What we lack in physical space we can gain in peace of mind. At&nbsp;some point, the passing on of unwanted or unneeded goods becomes almost spiritual in feeling. The&nbsp;evolution is endless, as the effort becomes part of the fun. The challenges become part of your&nbsp;charm.<br><br>Make no mistake, this book is gritty, grimy, and grubby. It is the real deal from the front lines&nbsp;of the tiny home realization. Other than a few minimally styled food photos, T he T iny Mess is a&nbsp;raw account of all the blissful and chaotic cooking currently going on in small kitchens&nbsp;everywhere. Inside you will find stained linens, dirty dishes, works-in-progress, and cheap beer,&nbsp;but with them come soulful meals, tender moments, and deeply nourishing traditions. Sure, elbow&nbsp;room may be hard to come by, but tasty and healthy food most definitely is not.<br>This book is as much about food as it is about kitchens, and it is as much about kitchens as it is&nbsp;about people.

When the marines -- or &#34;jarheads,&#34; as they call themselves -- were sent in 1990 to Saudi Arabia to fight the Iraqis, Swofford was there, with a hundred-pound pack on his shoulders and a sniper&#39;s rifle in his hands. It was one misery upon another. He lived in sand for six months, his girlfriend back home betrayed him for a scrawny hotel clerk, he was punished by boredom and fear, he considered suicide, he pulled a gun on one of his fellow marines, and he was shot at by both Iraqis and Americans. At the end of the war, Swofford hiked for miles through a landscape of incinerated Iraqi soldiers and later was nearly killed in a booby-trapped Iraqi bunker. Swofford weaves this experience of war with vivid accounts of boot camp (which included physical abuse by his drill instructor), reflections on the mythos of the marines, and remembrances of battles with lovers and family. As engagement with the Iraqis draws closer, he is forced to consider what it is to be an American, a soldier, a son of a soldier, and a man. Unlike the real-time print and television coverage of the Gulf War, which was highly scripted by the Pentagon, Swofford&#39;s account subverts the conventional wisdom that U.S. military interventions are now merely surgical insertions of superior forces that result in few American casualties. Jarhead insists we remember the Americans who are in fact wounded or killed, the fields of smoking enemy corpses left behind, and the continuing difficulty that American soldiers have reentering civilian life. A harrowing yet inspiring portrait of a tormented consciousness struggling for inner peace, Jarhead will elbow for room on that short shelf of American war classics that includes Philip Caputo&#39;s A Rumor of War and Tim O&#39;Brien&#39;s The Things They Carried, and be admired not only for the raw beauty of its prose but also for the depth of its pained heart.</p><p><b>Anthony Swofford</b> served in a U.S. Marine Corps Surveillance and Target Acquisition/Scout-Sniper platoon during the Gulf War. After the war, he was educated at American River College; the University of California, Davis; and the University of Iowa Writers' Workshop. He has taught at the University of Iowa and Lewis and Clark College. His fiction and nonfiction have appeared in <i>The New York Times, Harper's, Men's Journal, The Iowa Review,</i> and other publications. A Michener-Copernicus Fellowship recipient, he lives in Portland, Oregon, where he is at work on a novel.<b>Introduction</b><p>On August 2, 1990, Iraqi troops drive east to Kuwait City and start killing soldiers and civilians and capturing gold-heavy palaces and expensive German sedans -- though it is likely that the Iraqi atrocities are being exaggerated by Kuwaitis and Saudis and certain elements of the U.S. government, so as to gather more coalition support from the UN, the American people, and the international community generally.</p><p>Also on August 2, my platoon -- STA (pronounced <i>stay),</i> the Surveillance and Target Acquisition Platoon, scout/snipers, of the Second Battalion, Seventh Marines -- is put on standby. We're currently stationed at Twentynine Palms Marine Corps Base, in California's Mojave Desert.</p><p>After hearing the news of imminent war in the Middle East, we march in a platoon formation to the base barber and get fresh high-and-tight haircuts. And no wonder we call ourselves jarheads -- our heads look just like jars.</p><p>Then we send a few guys downtown to rent all of the war movies they can get their hands on. They also buy a hell of a lot of beer. For three days we sit in our rec room and drink all of the beer and watch all of those damn movies, and we yell <i>Semper fi</i> and we head-butt and beat the crap out of each other and we get off on the various visions of carnage and violence and deceit, the raping and killing and pillaging. We concentrate on the Vietnam films because it's the most recent war, and the successes and failures of that war helped write our training manuals. We rewind and review famous scenes, such as Robert Duvall and his helicopter gunships during <i>Apocalypse Now,</i> and in the same film Martin Sheen floating up the fake Vietnamese Congo; we watch Willem Dafoe get shot by a friendly and left on the battlefield in <i>Platoon;</i> and we listen closely as Matthew Modine talks trash to a streetwalker in <i>Full Metal Jacket.</i> We watch again the ragged, tired, burnt-out fighters walking through the villes and the pretty native women smiling because if they don't smile, the fighters might kill their pigs or burn their cache of rice. We rewind the rape scenes when American soldiers return from the bush after killing many VC to sip cool beers in a thatch bar while whores sit on their laps for a song or two (a song from the fifties when America was still sweet) before they retire to rooms and fuck the whores sweetly. The American boys, brutal, young farm boys or tough city boys, sweetly fuck the whores. Yes, somehow the films convince us that these boys are sweet, even though we know we are much like these boys and that we are no longer sweet.</p><p>There is talk that many Vietnam films are antiwar, that the message is war is inhumane and look what happens when you train young American men to fight and kill, they turn their fighting and killing everywhere, they ignore their targets and desecrate the entire country, shooting fully automatic, forgetting they were trained to aim. But actually, Vietnam war films are all pro-war, no matter what the supposed message, what Kubrick or Coppola or Stone intended. Mr. and Mrs. Johnson in Omaha or San Francisco or Manhattan will watch the films and weep and decide once and for all that war is inhumane and terrible, and they will tell their friends at church and their family this, but Corporal Johnson at Camp Pendleton and Sergeant Johnson at Travis Air Force Base and Seaman Johnson at Coronado Naval Station and Spec 4 Johnson at Fort Bragg and Lance Corporal Swofford at Twentynine Palms Marine Corps Base watch the same films and are excited by them, because the magic brutality of the films celebrates the terrible and despicable beauty of their fighting skills. Fight, rape, war, pillage, burn. Filmic images of death and carnage are pornography for the military man; with film you are stroking his cock, tickling his balls with the pink feather of history, getting him ready for his real First Fuck. It doesn't matter how many Mr. and Mrs. Johnsons are antiwar -- the actual killers who know how to use the weapons are not.</p><p>We watch our films and drink our beer and occasionally someone begins weeping and exits the room to stand on the catwalk and stare at the Bullion Mountains, the treacherous, craggy range that borders our barracks. Once, this person is me. It's nearly midnight, the temperature still in the upper nineties, and the sky is wracked with stars. Moonlight spreads across the desert like a white fire. The door behind me remains open, and on the TV screen an ambush erupts on one of the famous murderous hills of Vietnam.</p><p>I reenter the room and look at the faces of my fellows. We are all afraid, but show this in various ways -- violent indifference, fake ease, standard-issue bravura. We are afraid, but that doesn't mean we don't want to fight. It occurs to me that we will never be young again. I take my seat and return to the raging battle. The supposedly antiwar films have failed. Now is my time to step into the newest combat zone. And as a young man raised on the films of the Vietnam War, I want ammunition and alcohol and dope, I want to screw some whores and kill some Iraqi motherfuckers.</p><p>Copyright ï¿½ 2003 by Anthony Swofford</p></p><h2>Charmed Knits: Projects for Fans of Harry Potter</h2><p><b>Sit and Knit a Spell</b><p>You&#x2032;ll soon be knitting enchanting things you didn&#x2032;t know were within your powers.

Each volume contains all of the established classics of its genre under a single cover, in authoritative new editions and at a budget price. <em>European Sacred Music</em> is the second volume in the series and a fabulous value for money. From the Allegri <em>Misereri</em> to the Victora <em>O vos omnes</em>, John Rutter and co-editor Clifford Bartlett have researched the best available sources and provided excellent new English singing translations and sensible, practical keyboard reductions.</p><p>John Rutter is an OUP composer.Re: Passiontide Masterworks (Faber) - 'The selection is certainly worth singing, though it's a pity that there is such an overlap with the Oxford Choral Classics anthology of European Sacred Music which has 13 times as much music for under three times the price.'

The Singer</p><h2>The Telling</h2><p>The Left Hand of DarknessSutty, an Observer from Earth for the interstellar Ekumen, has been assigned to a new world-a world in the grips of a stern monolithic state, the Corporation. Embracing the sophisticated technology brought by other worlds and desiring to advance even faster into the future, the Akans recently outlawed the past, the old calligraphy, certain words, all ancient beliefs and ways; every citizen must now be a producer-consumer. Their state, not unlike the China of the Cultural Revolution, is one of secular terrorism. Traveling from city to small town, from loudspeakers to bleating cattle, Sutty discovers the remnants of a banned religion, a hidden culture. As she moves deeper into the countryside and the desolate mountains, she learns more about the Telling-the old faith of the Akans-and more about herself. With her intricate creation of an alien world, Ursula K. Le Guin compels us to reflect on our own recent history. <br></p><p>Earthling Sutty has been living a solitary, well-protected life in Dovza City on the planet Aka as an official Observer for the interstellar Ekumen. Insisting on all citizens being pure "producer-consumers," the tightly controlled capitalist government of Aka--the Corporation--is systematically destroying all vestiges of the ancient ways: "The Time of Cleansing" is the chilling term used to describe this era. Books are burned, the old language and calligraphy are outlawed, and those caught trying to keep any part of the past alive are punished and then reeducated. Frustrated in her attempts to study the linguistics and literature of Aka's cultural past, Sutty is sent upriver to the backwoods town of Okzat-Ozkat. Here she is slowly charmed by the old-world mountain people, whose still waters, she gradually realizes, run very deep. But whether their ways constitute a religion, ancient traditions, philosophy, or passive, political resistance, Sutty is not sure. Delving ever deeper into her hosts' culture, Sutty finds herself on a parallel spiritual quest, as well.<p> With quiet linguistic humor (Dovza citizens are passionate about their hot bitter beverage, <i>akakafi</i>--the ubiquitous Corporation brand is called Starbrew), dark references to the dangers of restricted cultural, political, and social freedom, and beautifully visualized worlds, award-winning author Ursula K. Le Guin pens her latest in the Hainish cycle, which includes <i>The Dispossessed</i> and <i>The Left Hand of Darkness</i>. Le Guin explores her characters and societies with such care, such thoughtfulness, her novels call out for slow, deep attention. <i>--Emilie Coulter</i></p>Ursula K.

First, gender and the development of gender roles across cultures are introduced. Scientific methods used to study gender, attitudes toward gender, and the latest data and theories on sex differences in cognitive, social, and emotional domains are then introduced. Theories of gender-role development, including evolutionary, social learning, social role, and gender schema theories are reviewed along with the implications of gender on achievement. Part one reviews the key information on the similarities and differences between the sexes and the theories that explain the differences which lay the foundation for the remainder of the book. Part two examines the role of gender in relationships including communication styles and the impact of these interactions on friendship and romantic relationships. The third part examines the role of gender on physical and mental health. The effects of marriage and parenting on health are reviewed, including domestic abuse, along with how gender affects the association between work and health. </p> <p>This is an ideal text for upper level gender-focused courses including the psychology of gender, psychology of women or men, gender issues, and gender, women&#x2019;s, or men&#x2019;s studies taught in psychology, women&#x2019;s studies, gender studies, sociology, and anthropology. </p></p><p><p><strong>Vicki S.

But when you develop resistance to your seven major metabolic hormones&#x2014;cortisol, thyroid, testosterone, growth hormone, leptin, insulin, and estrogen&#x2014;your body adjusts by increasingly raising your hormone levels and ultimately slowing down your metabolism. And a slower metabolism leads to weight gain and difficulty losing weight. The solution, Dr. Sara Gottfried contends, is to reset the efficiency of your hormones by repairing and growing new hormone receptors.</p><p>Based on leading scientific research, <em>The Hormone Reset Diet</em> is her proven weight loss and energy program to reverse hormone resistance in just three weeks. It will help you:</p><ul> <li> Boost your metabolism and calorie burning by growing new and fresh thyroid receptors;</li> <li> Increase your weight loss by re-balancing estrogen and progesterone receptors;</li> <li> Reverse your aging by resetting glucocorticoid receptors (for better processing cortisol).</li></ul><p>For the last twenty years, this Harvard-MIT educated physician has helped thousands of women address the root hormonal causes of what bothers them most: excess weight, lack of energy, aging, and illness. Going beyond her bestselling <em>The Hormone Cure</em>, this program is the next generation of her deep understanding of hormonal optimization for rapid weight loss.</p></p><p><p>The <em>New York Times</em> bestselling author of <em>The Hormone Cure</em> shows you how to reset your metabolic hormones to lose weight and feel great in just twenty-one days!</p><p>What we've been taught about dieting is all wrong. Weight loss isn't about restricting calories and willpower. It's about hormones: the chemical molecules that govern nearly all aspects of your body fat, from how much you store and where it's stored, to cravings, appetite, gut bacteria, and even addictive eating patterns. Being overweight is the result of major hormonal misfires involving seven metabolic hormones&#x2014;estrogen, insulin, leptin, cortisol, thyroid, growth hormone, and testosterone&#x2014;each of which is affected by the foods you consume every day.</p><p>When these hormones misfire, your body adjusts by changing their levels, a fluctuation that ultimately slows down the metabolism, causing you to store fat every time you eat instead of using it as fuel to energize you. When your metabolism is broken, <em>you get fatter no matter what you do</em>&#x2014;especially after age forty&#x2014;and can eventually develop insulin resistance, diabetes, heart disease, and even dementia.</p><p>The good news is that you can turn this problem around in only twenty-one days. Based on leading scientific research, <em>The Hormone Reset Diet</em> is Dr. Gottfried's proven step-by-step plan designed to help women of all shapes and sizes, ages, and ethnicities lose weight and feel lighter and more energetic. In seven three-day bursts, you'll make specific dietary changes, eliminating metabolism-wrecking foods&#x2014;meat and alcohol, sugar, fruit, caffeine, grain, dairy, and toxins&#x2014;to repair your body and reset your hormones. At the end of twenty-one days, Dr. Gottfried shows you how to develop a new personalized food code that enables you to look and feel your best every single day. In addition, this highly practical guide explores the emotional issues that drive cravings, addictions, and habits, offering insights to quench incessant hunger and get your life back.

Written by two legendary scholar-activists, <i>Reproductive Justice </i>introduces students to an intersectional analysis of race, class, and gender politics. Loretta J. Ross and Rickie Solinger put the lives and lived experience of women of color at the center of the book and use a human rights analysis to show how the discussion around reproductive justice differs significantly from the pro-choice/anti-abortion debates that have long dominated the headlines and mainstream political conflict.&nbsp;Arguing that reproductive justice is a political movement of&nbsp;reproductive rights and social justice, the authors illuminate, for example, the complex web of structural obstacles a low-income, physically disabled woman living in West Texas faces as she contemplates her sexual and reproductive intentions. In a period in which women&#x2019;s reproductive lives are imperiled, <i>Reproductive Justice </i>provides an essential guide to understanding and mobilizing around women&#x2019;s human rights in the twenty-first century.<br> &nbsp;<br> Reproductive Justice: A New Vision for the Twenty-First Century publishes works that explore the contours and content of reproductive justice. The series will include&nbsp;primers&nbsp;intended for students and those new to reproductive justice as well as&nbsp;books of original research&nbsp;that will further knowledge and impact society. Learn more at www.ucpress.edu/go/reproductivejustice.</p><p>&#x201c;Controlling reproduction and the bodies of women seems to be the first step in every hierarchy. That&#x2019;s why reproductive justice&#x2014;women having power over our own bodies&#x2014;is the crucial first step toward any democracy, any human rights, and any justice.&#x201d; &#x2014;Gloria Steinem&nbsp;<br><br> &#x201c;Now more than ever, as reproductive autonomy and the rights of people of color are under attack, we at Planned Parenthood know our fates are intertwined. The reproductive justice movement&#x2014;which comes directly from the expertise and the lived experience of women of color&#x2014;illuminated a path forward to hold the line on the rights we have won and to expand the rights of all people.&nbsp;We need to know the history laid out in <i>Reproductive Justice</i>, because we need to not repeat the ugliness of the past. Our strategies need to be inclusive and intersectional, because when women of color and those most affected by reproductive oppression are free to make their own decisions about their health and their bodies, we all win.

Ware codified Vignola for the American Renaissance." &#x2014; John Barrington Bayley, from the Introductory Notes to <i>The American Vignola<br></i>From 1890 to 1940, Americans designed and built classical architecture on an extraordinary scale. During this American Renaissance were built countless libraries, museums, universities, courthouses, capitol buildings and other structures, both public and private, rich with domes, pediments, colonnades, and other classical features. "We built with unparalleled grandeur," architect and scholar John Barrington Bayley observes, "and our architecture led the world." <br>More than any other document of the period, <i>The American Vignola</i> laid the groundwork for this grand resurgence in&nbsp;American architecture. Its author, William R. Ware, founded America's first school of architecture at M.I.T. in 1865, and sixteen years later, the School of Architecture at Columbia University. He became America's leading teacher of the art of designing classical architecture. <i>The American Vignola</i> is his textbook on that art. <br>As the Renaissance architect Giacomo Barozzi da Vignola helped to recover the lost laws of classical architecture that made possible the architectural wonders of the Italian Renaissance, Ware helped lay the groundwork for the wonders of the American Renaissance. <i>The American Vignola </i>contains tables of the Tuscan, Ionic, Doric, Corinthian, and Composite Orders; measured drawings of the great monuments of the ancient, Renaissance, and baroque periods; and guides for drawing and establishing geometrical relations. Especially important are its detailed practical instructions for designing classical arches and vaults, roofs and domes, doors and windows, walls and ceilings, steps and staircases, and more. Over 300 illustrations illuminate the text, including 37 full-page plates and 267 smaller figures. Introductory notes by Mr. Bayley and architectural expert Henry Hope Reed set Mr. Ware's great achievement in perspective.<br></p><p></p><h2>Les Miserables</h2><p>Victor Hugo&#39;s towering novel of Jean Valjean, his unjust imprisonment, and his lifelong flight from a relentless police officer.</p><p>Born in 1802, the son of a high officer in Napoleon&#x2019;s army, <b>Victor Hugo</b> spent his childhood against a background of military life in Elba, Corsica, Naples, and Madrid. After the Napoleonic defeat, the Hugo family settled in straitened circumstances in Paris, where, at the age of fifteen, Victor Hugo commenced his literary career with a poem submitted to a contest sponsored by the Acadï¿½mie Franï¿½aise. Twenty-four years later, Hugo was elected to the Acadï¿½mie, having helped revolutionize French literature with his poems, plays, and novels. Entering politics, he won a seat in the National Assembly in 1848; but in 1851, he was forced to flee the country because of his opposition to Louis Napoleon. In exile on the Isle of Guernsey, he became a symbol of French resistance to tyranny; upon his return to Paris after the Revolution of 1870, he was greeted as a national hero. He continued to serve in public life and to write with unabated vigor until his death in 1885. He was buried in the Pantheon with every honor the French nation could bestow.<br> <p> <b>Lee Fahnestock</b> and <b>Norman MacAfee</b> have translated two volumes of the letters of Jean-Paul Sartre, edited by Simone de Beauvoir: <i>Witness to My Life</i> and <i>Quiet Moments in a War</i>. For their work together, they have received an NEA Translation fellowship and the American Literary Translators Association Award. Lee Fahnestock has translated fiction as well as four volumes of the poetry of Francis Ponge, including <i>The Making of the Prï¿½ </i>and <i>The Nature of Things</i>. The French Government honored her with the Chevalier de l&#x2019;ordre des arts et des lettres. Norman MacAfee&#x2019;s other books include <i>One Class: Selected Poems; The Gospel According to RFK: Why It Matters Now;</i> the opera <i>The Death of the Forest</i>; and translations of Pier Paolo Pasolini&#x2019;s poetry.</p><br>From the Introduction by Peter Washington- Victor Hugo might be regarded as the Mr Toad of French literature: vain, arrogrant, pompous, selfish, cold and stingy; a windbag, a humbug and a fraud, absurdly puffed up with the immensity of his own greatness. But unlike Mr Toad, he was also an astute and energetic promoter of hisown image as a Great Man. The process began early. Writing in Hugo&#39;s lifetime, Virginie Ancelot recalls the reception the young poet received in literary drawing-rooms when he arrived to read his latest ode. &#34;...There was a few moments&#39; silence; then someone rose and approached him with visible emotion, took his hand and raised their eyes to heaven.The multitude listened. A single word was heard, to the great surprise of the uninitiated. And this word, which echoed in every corner of the salon, was:&#39;Cathedral!&#39;Then the orator returned to his place; another rose and cried out: &#39;Ogive!&#39;A third looked round him and ventured:&#39;Egyptian Pyramid!&#39;The assembly applauded, and then it was lost in profound reflection.&#34; To the Anglo-Saxon mind - and, it should be said, to many Frenchmen - this is Parisian literary life at its worst: the posturing, the pretension, the self-regard, masquerading under the name of art. Yet Hugo is the man who wrote a handful of the most exquisite lyrics - &#39;Victor Hugo, helas!&#39;said Gide when someone asked him to name the finest French poet - and at least one novel judged to be supreme. In his person, he sums up all that is most monsterous in writerly vanity; in his best work he transcended his failings. How did he do it? How did a monster come to write the masterpiece that is Les Miserables? * In an early essay on Scott, Hugo prophesies that&#34;After the picturesque but prosaic novel of Walter Scott, there will still be another novel to create ... It is the novel which is at once drama and epic, picturesque and poetic, real and ieal, true and great, the novel which will enshrine Walter Scott in Homer.&#34;These words were written in 1823, just after the publication of his own first novel, Han d&#39;Islande, and there is no doubt that Hugo had himself in mind as the man who could &#39;enshrine Walter Scott as Homer&#39;. Anyone who can still get through this book may take a rather different view. Set in seventeeth-century Norway and dripping with gore on every page, Han d&#39;Islande is nearer to the Gothic horror tradition than to Scott. For the man who really succeeded in reconciling the genres of epic and historic fiction we have to look further afield, to Hugo&#39;s own admirerer, Tolstoy. Yet it was Tolstoy who vindicated the French novelist&#39;s early ambition by judging Les Miserables one of the world&#39;s great novels, if not the greates, and acknowledged its effect on his own work. Les Miserables was completed in 1862, shortly before the Russian novelist began War and Peace. The two novels are set in the same period. It cannot be said that Hugo had much to teach his junior about structure or characterization; like all his attempts at epic, in prose and verse, Les Miserables rambles, there are huge digressions and absurdities of plot, the characters are often thin, the action melodramatic. But in spacious, vigorous story-telling, in the use of an historical framework, in the relating of human events to a larger philosophical and spiritual context, in the deployment of fiction as a social and political weapon, in the exalatation of &#39;the people&#39; as a supreme authority, in the treatment of suffering as a dominant theme - in all these matters, Hugo exerted a profound influence on Tolstoy. Without his example, War and Peace might have been a very different novel. Perhaps the most extraordinary point of contact between them concerns Napoleon. One might expect the emperor to intrigue European writers in the early nineteenth century, as he intrigues Byron, Balzac and Stendhal, among others, but by the 1860s almost half a century had passed since Waterloo, yet Hugo and Tolstoy are still trying to unravel the mystery of one whose shadow falls across the entire century. For Tolstoy, Napoleon is pre-eminently a human being - an extraordinary man, certainly, the instrument of destiny, but still a man. For Hugo he is more like a superman, a mysterious brooding presence with almost divine powers. The point is made by an ironic comparison between Napoleon and Wellington. Hugo&#39;s argument seems to be that Napoleon ought to have won Waterloo by sheer force of genius - indeed, that he did win it, when judged according to the rules of natural justice - but that Wellington achieved a victory on points by taking more care to spy out the lay of the battlefield and to estimate the balance of forces. Calculation is everything to the mundane Englishman, imagination nothing. When lightning flashes round the emperor&#39;s head, the duke looks like a very ordinary man. While Napoleon surveys the heavens, Wellington consults his watch. Clearly, the image of general as genius was vital to Hugo&#39;s own project of himself as a literary Napoleon, but there is more to it than that. Commentators have often lamented the digression on Waterloo which is quite unnecessary to the plot and, coming early in the book, throws it decisively out of its narrative stride. But Hugo, though careless of structural refinement, does have a more serious purpose here - a purpose from which Tolstoy must have learnt much, and not only in his description of Borodino. For Hugo, who in turn learnt so much from Scott, grasped the fact that by imprinting the significance of a decisive historical moment on the minds of his readers he could hugely enlarge the scope of his novel. Precisely because Les Miserables is about little people, the history of a great man is one means of linking their petty lives with the Infinite. (The link is made touchingly explicit in the chapter called &#39;In Which Little Gavroche Takes Advantage of Napoleon the Great&#39;.) Even events as great as Waterloo, we are told, can hinge on details: the location of a ditch, the arrival of a platoon. Conversely, the most trivial life may exemplify a great truth - and in that sense, all lives are equally significant, for every existence embodies these truths. At the same time, Hugo&#39;s treatment of Waterloo makes it clear that realities and appearances diverge as much in everyday life as they do in historical interpretation - and that the two divergences are linked. What a post-Waterloo Frenchman thinks of Napoleon helps to shape what he thinks of himself. Sometimes we try to envision history in our own image; sometimes we use it to understand ourselves; at all times we are formed by it without our knowledge. One function of fiction is to help us achieve that knowledge. Les Miserables is, among other things, an attempt to explain the people of the mid-nineteenth century to themselves. Jean Valjean finds himself in a certain situation because he is a poor Frenchman at a particular time. This is one version of Fate - the sociological and political explanation of things. But Valjean is like Waterloo: his life also has a deeper purpose, a hidden meaning. Hugo has a number of names for this meaning - Fate, Destiny, God, the Infinite. But whatever he calls it, we observe a complex dialogue throughout the book between the surface causes of Valjean&#39;s predicament - poverty and ignorance - and their deeper meaning, to which he penetrates through suffering.</p><h2>BUtterfield 8 (Penguin Drop Caps)</h2><p><b>From A to Z, the Penguin Drop Caps series collects 26 unique hardcovers&#x2014;featuring cover art by Jessica Hische</b><br>It all begins with a letter.

Yet he was Hitler's top enforcer, in charge of the Gestapo, the SS, and the so-called Final Solution. We can only wonder, as biographer Peter Longerich asks, how could such a banal personality attain such a historically unique position of power? How could the son of a prosperous Bavarian Catholic public servant become the organizer of a system of mass murder spanning the whole of Europe?<br><br>In the first comprehensive biography of this murderous enigma, Longerich answers those questions with a superb account of Himmler's inner self and outward acts. Masterfully interweaving the story of Himmler's personal life and political career with the wider history of the Nazi dictatorship, Longerich shows how skillfully he exploited and manipulated his disparate roles in the pursuit of his far-reaching and grandiose objectives. Himmler's actual strength, he writes, consisted in redrawing every two or three years the master plans for his sphere of power. Himmler expanded that sphere with ruthless efficiency. In 1929, he took the SS-a small bodyguard unit-and swelled it into a paramilitary organization with elite pretensions. By the end of 1934 he had become Reich Chief of the Political Police, and began to consolidate all police power in his own hands. As Germany grabbed neighboring territory, he expanded the Waffen SS and organized the "Germanization" of conquered lands, which culminated in systematic mass murder. When the regime went on the defensive in 1942, Himmler changed his emphasis again, repressing any opposition or unrest. The author emphasizes the centrality of Himmler's personality to the Nazi murder machine-his surveillance of the private lives of his men, his deep resentments, his fierce prejudices-showing that man and position were inseparable. <br><br>Carefully researchedand lucidly written, Heinrich Himmler is the essential account of the man who embodied Hitler's apparatus of evil.</p><p><br><strong>Peter Longerich</strong> is Professor of Modern German History at Royal Holloway University of London and founder of the College's Holocaust Research Centre.

But it can also be a challenge. How do you spot a likely subject? How do you choose the person most likely to stay still? How do you draw movement for the person that refuses to sit still? <i>Sketching People</i> offers straightforward, practical help to give beginning artists the confidence and ability to draw all sorts of people in many different settings. In the pages of this book, readers will find:<ul><li>How to capture the essence of character</li><li>Different line-work styles</li><li>Techniques for creating realistic skin tones</li><li>The key to capturing the details of street life</li><li>Ways to create fabric folds</li><li>Mastering tonal drawings</li><li>Conveying age differences, and more</li></ul>This clearly written, fun to read book is bursting with inspirational artwork and candid advice that will help you improve your drawing skills and change the way you sketch for the better.</p><p>Lynne Chapman has worked as a freelance illustrator for 18 years and spends time outside the studio visiting schools and libraries. She lives in Sheffield, England."There's a chapter on choosing a sketchbook, and a chapter on pencils and pens and paintbrushes, there are chapters on technique for lighting, for drawing heads and hands and feet, all the requisite chapters for a how-to-draw book. What makes this book so useful are the chapters on more nebulous concepts, like how to choose a subject, or what to do when people notice you drawing. What Chapman's book does that makes it so helpful is that, instead of saying, "One day you might be able to do this, and maybe people will take you seriously," Chapman makes you, the artist, feel like a confident member of an envied community. She notes that almost everyone wishes they could draw, so the very idea that you're doing it at all makes you seem incredible."<br>&#x2014;<i>San Francisco Book Review, www.sanfranciscobookreview.com</i></p><h2>The Books of Ezra and Nehemiah: The New International Commentary on the Old Testament</h2><p>A biblical scholar well known for his expertise in ancient Near Eastern studies, expecially Ugaritic, author Fensham places Ezra and Nehemiah against the ancient Near East environment.

Intimate Enemies, however, is the spellbinding true account of this resilient woman's life -- and the three men who most affected its course.<br>Immediately upon marrying Cï¿½lestin de Pontalba, Micaela was removed to his family's estate in France. For twenty years her father-in-law attempted to drive her to abandon Cï¿½lestin; by law he could then seize control of her fortune. He tried dozens of strategies, including at one point instructing the entire Pontalba household to pretend she was invisible. Finally, in 1834, the despairing elder Pontalba trapped Micaela in a bedroom and shot her four times before turning his gun on himself.<br>Miraculously, she survived. Five years later, after securing both a separation from Cï¿½lestin and legal power over her wealth, Micaela focused her attention on building, following in the footsteps of her late, illustrious father, Andrï¿½s Almonester. Her Parisian mansion, the Hï¿½tel Pontalba, is today the official residence of the American embassy in France; and her Pontalba Buildings, which flank Jackson's Square in New Orleans, form together with her father's St. Louis Cathedral, Presbytere, and Cabildo one of the loveliest architectural complexes in America.<br>As for Cï¿½lestin, he eventually suffered a total physical and mental breakdown and begged Micaela to return. She did so, caring for him for the next twenty-three years until her death in 1874.<br>In Intimate Enemies, Christina Vella embroiders the compelling story of the Almonester-Pontalba alliance against a richly woven background of the events and cultures of two centuries and two vivid societies. She provides a window into the yellow fever epidemics that raged in New Orleans; the rebuilding of Paris, the Paris Commune uprising, and the Second Empire of Napoleon III; European ideas of power, class, money, marriage, and love during the baroness' lifetime and their inflection in the New World setting of New Orleans; medical treatments, legal procedures, imperial court life, banking practices, and much more.<br>Combining the historian's meticulous research with the biographer's exacting knowledge of her subject and the novelist's gift for narrative, Vella has crafted a rare cross-genre work that will capture the imagination and admiration of every reader.</p></p><p><p>Christina Vella writes and lectures in New Orleans and is a consultant for the U.S. State Department. She is author of Indecent Secrets: The Infamous Murri Murder Affair of 1905 and coauthor of The Hitler Kiss: A Memoir of the Czech Resistance.</p><p>Christina Vella is an adjunct professor of history at Tulane University and coauthor with Radomir Luza of The Hitler Kiss: A Memoir of the Czech Resistance. She writes, lectures, and teaches in New Orleans, where she lives with her husband and their two daughters.</p>A charming biography of the Baroness de Pontalba (17951874), a wealthy 19th-century American expatriate. The baroness, born Micaela Almonester, was the daughter of a Spanish immigrant who had made it in the rough-and-tumble commercial world of New Orleans; at 15, she was the sole heir to a considerable fortune. As such, she attracted the attention of the Pontalbas, her aristocratic French cousins. Xavier Pontalba wrote to Micaela's mother to propose to her daughter on behalf of his son, C&#x201a;lestin, and in 1811, C&#x201a;lestin sailed to America to meet and court his young cousin. The two were married within a month, and Micaela returned with her new family to France. Once there, however, Micaela's troubles began. She was not entirely content with her life in the country estate of her in-laws. Vella (History/Tulane Univ.) writes, with the tongue-in-cheek style that contributes greatly to the book's charm, that ``sixteen-year-olds often look on compost with indifference.'' But the bigger problem came when the dowry of the young heiress was finalized, and the greedy Pontalbas discovered that it was considerably less than they had hoped. Xavier Pontalba, who dominated his weak-willed son, began a war against his daughter-in-law that would last until he ended his own life, in 1834, after shooting Micaela four times at close range and nearly killing her. This dramatic climax was followed by divorce, an interest in construction that took hold of the baroness in her middle years (the home she built in Paris is now the US embassy), and an odd semi-reconciliation between Micaela and an ill C&#x201a;lestin as she nursed him for the last 23 years of her own life. While the baroness's story might make a more satisfying novel than biography, Vella makes up for the occasional skimpiness of her material with an easy, elegant style.

A rich, successful Moscow professor befriends a stray dog and attempts a scientific first by transplanting into it the testicles and pituitary gland of a recently deceased man.

He rapidly abandoned medicine to write some of the greatest Russian literature of this century. After a lifetime at odds with the stultifying Soviet regime, he died impoverished and blind in 1940, shortly after completing his masterpiece, The Master and Margarita.

In a hundred-odd recipes that cover the end-of-the-day meal gamut from soups and sides to entrï¿½es, Bittman packs strong flavor into a few ingredients so that food lovers can return home from a long day at work and make a meal that's satisfying but not exhausting. <p> With less introductory text but more side notes than Bittman's previous cookbooks (<i>The Minimalist Cooks at Home</i> and the new classic, <i>How to Cook Everything</i>), <i>The Minimalist Cooks Dinner</i> commences with a section of 12 soups and stews--ranging from a truly spare miso soup to the richer Black-Eyed Pea Soup with Ham and Watercress--and then covers pasta, pizza, entrï¿½es (with shellfish, fish, poultry, or meat), salads, and starchy sides. Easy dishes such as Steak with Chimichurri Sauce (simply parsley, raw garlic, lemon juice, crushed red pepper, and olive oil), Fish Simmered in Spicy Soy Sauce (soy, sugar, scallions, and chile), or Scallops with Almonds (cayenne, almonds, white wine, and butter) are startlingly delicious, especially considering they take at most 30 minutes to prepare. But perhaps this cookbook's best asset, particularly for less-experienced cooks, are the crucial "Keys to Success" and the improvisational "With Minimal Effort" side bars, which respectively offer additional instruction and suggestions for quick ways to enhance the original dish. While not as comprehensive as Bittman's bestselling <i>How to Cook Everything</i> or <i>The Minimalist Cooks at Home</i>, this is an expertly refined collection that presents perfect, almost effortless meals for every night of the week. <i>--Rebecca Wright</i></p>Mark Bittman is the creator and author of the popular weekly <i>New York Times </i>column &#x201c;The Minimalist,&#x201d; and a frequent contributor to the newspaper&#x2019;s Dining In/Dining Out section.

Runaway climate change, the sixth great extinction of planetary life, the acidification of the oceans&#x2014;all point toward an era of unprecedented turbulence in humanity&#x2019;s relationship within the web of life. But just what is that relationship, and how do we make sense of this extraordinary transition? <i>Anthropocene or Capitalocene? </i>offers answers to these questions from a dynamic group of leading critical scholars who challenge the conventional practice of dividing historical change and contemporary reality into &#x201c;Nature&#x201d; and &#x201c;Society,&#x201d; demonstrating the possibilities offered by a more nuanced and connective view of human environment-making, joined at every step with and within the biosphere. In distinct registers, the authors frame their discussions within a politics of hope that signal the possibilities for transcending capitalism, broadly understood as a &#x201c;world-ecology&#x201d; that joins nature, capital, and power as a historically evolving whole.</p><p><b>Jason W.

Although best-known for her work <i>A Raisin in the Sun</i>, her short life was full of extraordinary experiences and achievements, and she had an unflinching commitment to social justice, which brought her under FBI surveillance when she was barely in her twenties. While her close friends and contemporaries, like James Baldwin and Nina Simone, have been rightly celebrated, her story has been diminished and relegated to one work&#x2014;until now. In 2018, Hansberry will get the recognition she deserves with the PBS American Masters documentary &#x201c;Lorraine Hansberry: Sighted Eyes/Feeling Heart&#x201d; and Imani Perry&#x2019;s multi-dimensional, illuminating biography, <i>Looking for Lorraine</i>.<br><br>After the success of <i>A Raisin in the Sun</i>, Hansberry used her prominence in myriad ways: challenging President Kennedy and his brother to take bolder stances on Civil Rights, supporting African anti-colonial leaders, and confronting the romantic racism of the Beat poets and Village hipsters. Though she married a man, she identified as lesbian and, risking censure and the prospect of being outed, joined one of the nation&#x2019;s first lesbian organizations. Hansberry associated with many activists, writers, and musicians, including Malcolm X, Langston Hughes, Duke Ellington, Paul Robeson, W.E.B. Du Bois, among others. <i>Looking for Lorraine</i> is a powerful insight into Hansberry&#x2019;s extraordinary life&#x2014;a life that was tragically cut far too short.<br><br><b>A Black Caucus of the American Library Association Honor Book for Nonfiction</b><br><br><b>A 2019 Pauli Murray Book Prize Finalist</b></p><p><b>Imani Perry</b> is the Hughes-Rogers Professor of African American Studies at Princeton University, where she is also affiliated with the Programs in Gender and Sexuality Studies and Law and Public Affairs.

She holds a PhD from Harvard in American Studies, a JD from Harvard Law School, an LLM from Georgetown University Law Center, and a BA from Yale College. She is also a creative nonfiction essayist and a book reviewer. A native of Birmingham, Alabama, Perry spent most of her childhood in Massachusetts, as well as time in Chicago. Perry currently lives in the Philadelphia area with her two sons.&#x201c;Perry approaches her subject with both empathy and a sharp, critical eye; this is a biography that exercises several muscles at once. Perry&#x2019;s sentences are intimate, warm, and crisp; in considerning Hansberry in all of her prismatic multiplicities, Perry has written a singular book.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;Nell Irvin Painter, Sam Stephenson, and Rachel Syme, judges for the PEN/Jacqueline Bograd Weld Award<br><br>&#x201c;Perry seeks to deepen our appreciation in this richly dimensional portrait of a brightly blazing artist, thinker, and activist . . . . Perry does not dwell on the minutiae of traditional biographical coverage of what, when, and where, focusing, instead, on who and why, on inner drama rather than exterior events. Mining writings private and published, collecting memories, tracking the reverberations of Hansberry&#x2019;s personality, words, and actions, and, at times, entering the narrative, Perry illuminates with arresting impact Hansberry&#x2019;s thoughts, feelings, and revolutionary social consciousness . . . . Perry&#x2019;s ardent, expert, and redefining work of biographical discovery brings light, warmth, scope, and enlightening complexity to the spine-straightening story of a brilliant, courageous, seminal, and essential American writer.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;<i>Booklist</i>, Starred Review<br><br>&#x201c;An intimate portrait of the artist as a black woman at the crossroads . . . Perry infuses the narrative with a sense of urgency and enthusiasm because she believes Hansberry has something to teach us in these &#x2018;complicated times.&#x2019; Impressively, she tells her subject&#x2019;s story in a tightly packed 200 pages. Perry also smartly delves into the inspirations for Hansberry&#x2019;s brilliant <i>A Raisin in the Sun</i> and engagingly explores Hansberry&#x2019;s profound friendships with James Baldwin and Nina Simone . . . Throughout this animated and inspiring biography, Perry reminds us that the &#x2018;battles Lorraine fought are still before us: exploitation of the poor, racism, neocolonialism, homophobia, and patriarchy.&#x2019;&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;<i>Kirkus Reviews</i>, Starred Review<br><br>&#x201c;A must-read for fans of black and queer history, literary, biography, and women&#x2019;s history.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;<i>Library Journal</i>, Starred Review<br><br>&#x201c;Its strongest chapters &#x2014; on <i>A Raisin in the Sun</i> and Lorraine&#x2019;s coming into her own as a public intellectual &#x2014; are masterly syntheses of research and analysis. It&#x2019;s a joy for devotees to encounter some record of Hansberry&#x2019;s influences, including the Chicago poet Gwendolyn Brooks, the Irish playwright Sean O&#x2019;Casey and the French philosopher Simone de Beauvoir. . . . Perry makes a welcome case for a fresh assessment of Hansberry&#x2019;s nondramatic works: her short stories, many published pseudonymously in lesbian magazines, and her many letters and op-eds on politics and literature for <i>The Village Voice</i> and <i>The New York Times</i>.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;<i>The New York Times Book Review</i><br><br>&#x201c;A work of scholarship and love . . . .

I didn&#x2019;t know how hungry I was for this intimate portrait until now. It feels as though Ms. Hansberry has walked into my living room and sat down beside me. What an honor and joy to read this.

Lorraine Hansberry was so dear, so gifted, so black, so singular in so many ways, that to miss the story of her life is to miss a huge part of ours. She left us way too soon, and yet the gift of her presence, so briefly among us, is still felt in the art she left behind. But not only in the art, but in the life. A life at last made comprehensible by this loving, attentive, thoughtful book.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;Alice Walker<br><br>&#x201c;I have always admired the brilliant Lorraine Hansberry. Now I treasure her even more. Imani Perry&#x2019;s magnificently written and extremely well researched <i>Looking for Lorraine</i> reclaims for all of us the Lorraine Hansberry we should have had all along, the multifaceted genius for whom <i>A Raisin in the Sun</i> was just the tip of the iceberg. Though Hansberry&#x2019;s life was brief, her powerful work remains vital and urgently necessary. One can say the same of this phenomenal book, which hopefully will lead more readers to both Hansberry&#x2019;s published and unpublished works.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;Edwidge Danticat, author of <i>Brother, I&#x2019;m Dying</i><br><br>&#x201c;This powerful and profound book is the definitive treatment of a literary genius, political revolutionary, and spiritual radical&#x2014;Lorraine Hansberry.

Winner of the&nbsp;<b>2017 Scott Moncrieff Prize</b></b><br> <b>&nbsp;</b><br>This distressing but hugely important text has influenced countless individuals throughout history: Flaubert and Baudelaire both read Sade; the surrealists were obsessed with him; film-makers like Pasolini saw parallels with twentieth-century history in his writings; and feminists such as Andrea Dworkin and Angela Carter clashed over him. This new translation brings Sade's provocative novel into Penguin Classics for the first time, and will reignite the debate around this most controversial of writers.<br>&nbsp;<br> For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world. With more than 1,700 titles, Penguin Classics represents a global bookshelf of the best works throughout history and across genres and disciplines.

These black-and-white and vibrantly colored images, many resembling abstract art, are employed daily by scientists around the world, but most have never before been seen by the general public. Each chapter addresses a different set of techniques for studying the brain as revealed through the images, and each is introduced by a leading scientist in that field of study. Author Carl Schoonover&#x2019;s captions provide detailed explanations of each image as well as the major insights gained by scientists over the course of the past 20 years. Accessible to a wide audience, this book reveals the elegant methods applied to study the mind, giving readers a peek at its innermost workings, helping us to understand them, and offering clues about what may lie ahead.&nbsp;<br><br>Praise for <i>Portraits of the Mind:</i>&nbsp;<br><br>"An odyssey through the brain, illuminated by a rainbow"&nbsp;<br>--New York Times<br><br>&nbsp;"Stunning images"&nbsp;<br>--Scientific American&nbsp;<br><br>"The collection of images in the new book <i>Portraits of the Mind</i> is truly impressive . . .

Lowrie's translation, first published in 1941 and later revised, was the first in English, and it has introduced hundreds of thousands of readers to Kierkegaard's thought. Kierkegaard counted <i>Fear and Trembling</i> and <i>The Sickness Unto Death</i> among "the most perfect books I have written," and in them he introduces two terms--"the absurd" and "despair"--that have become key terms in modern thought. <i>Fear and Trembling</i> takes up the story of Abraham and Isaac to explore a faith that transcends the ethical, persists in the face of the absurd, and meets its reward in the return of all that the faithful one is willing to sacrifice, while <i>The Sickness Unto Death</i> examines the spiritual anxiety of despair.</p><br><p> Walter Lowrie's magnificent translation of these seminal works continues to provide an ideal introduction to Kierkegaard. And, as Gordon Marino argues in a new introduction, these books are as relevant as ever in today's age of anxiety.</p></p><p><b>Walter Lowrie</b> (1868-1959) played a leading role in introducing Kierkegaard to the English-speaking world as his first English-language biographer and the first English translator of more than a dozen volumes of his work. <b>Gordon Marino</b> is professor at St. Olaf College, specializing in History of Philosophy, Philosophy of Religion, and Kierkegaard. He is the author of <i>Kierkegaard in the Present Age</i> and coeditor of <i>The Cambridge Companion to Kierkegaard</i>.</p><h2>Contemporary Health Informatics</h2><p>Health informatics-the application of information technology to healthcare delivery-is changing dramatically because of federal investment in adoption, new cloud-based technologies to encourage data sharing and patient participation, and new financial incentives to encourage coordinated care. The traditional provider- and hospital-centric view of care and health information technology is morphing into one which combines electronic records with the Internet for information exchange and data from low cost mobile- and home-based devices to create a comprehensive, more holistic electronic health record of each patient&#39;s care. This text emphasizes these contemporary approaches through a focus on ambulatory care for chronic disease, arguably the major challenge for US healthcare. Contemporary Health Informatics is divided into four sections: background on the US healthcare system and federal policies intended to re-engineer it; the core technologies of health information technology; the application of these technologies in state-of-the-art real-world products and solutions; and the mining, analysis, and visualization of the vast amounts of newly available digital health data to gain knowledge and improve care delivery. Key Features Up-to-date: written within the context of current health informatics Grounded in actual practice: numerous case studies illustrate the practical applications of the technologies discussed Forward facing: based on the evolution of the healthcare system away from hospitals and toward primary and community care Written for a broad audience: based on Dr. Braunstein&#39;s MOOC that has proven successful for learners from healthcare providers to information technologists to those with numerous other health- related backgrounds and skill sets</p><p></p><h2>Brute: Poems</h2><p><p><b>Selected by Joy Harjo as the winner of the Walt Whitman Award of the Academy of American Poets</b></p><p>Emily Skaja&#x2019;s debut collection is a fiery, hypnotic book that confronts the dark questions and menacing silences around gender, sexuality, and violence. <i>Brute</i> arises, brave and furious, from the dissolution of a relationship, showing how such endings necessitate self-discovery and reinvention. The speaker of these poems is a sorceress, a bride, a warrior, a lover, both object and agent, ricocheting among ways of knowing and being known. Each incarnation squares itself up against ideas of feminine virtue and sin, strength and vulnerability, love and rage, as it closes in on a hard-won freedom.</p><p><i> Brute</i> is absolutely sure of its capacity to insist not only on the truth of what it says but on the truth of its right to say it. &#x201c;What am I supposed to say: I&#x2019;m <i>free</i>?&#x201d; the first poem asks. The rest of the poems emphatically discover new ways to answer. This is a timely winner of the Walt Whitman Award, and an introduction to an unforgettable voice.</p></p><p><b>Emily Skaja</b> grew up in rural Illinois and is a graduate of the creative writing MFA program at Purdue University. Her poems have been published in <i>Best New Poets</i>, <i>Blackbird</i>, <i>Crazyhorse</i>, <i>FIELD</i>, and <i>Gulf Coast</i>. She lives in Memphis, Tennessee.<p>&#x201c;What happens when rage and grief transform us, when our bodily fury makes us feel animal? What language do we use to howl such feral moments? These are the questions that animate Skaja&#x2019;s taut, ferocious debut, Brute. . . . This is a book about survival, and a welcome, confident debut.&#x201d;<b>&#x2015;<i>The New York Times Book Review </i></b></p><p>&#x201c;[In <i>Brute</i>], the anguish comes from an emotionally abusive lover and the abrupt end of a relationship. As the speaker excavates her grief and disbelief, she slowly moves from self-condemnation to a fiery insistence that she can overcome her boyfriend&#x2019;s damaging assessments of her worth and reclaim the power she once had. . . . The speaker&#x2019;s brutal honesty and emotional transformation offer an engrossing guide for anyone dealing with a devastating loss.&#x201d;<b>&#x2015;<i>The Washington Post </i></b></p><p>&#x201c;Emily Skaja's [<i>Brute</i>] is lyrical, visceral, sharp like a fang, and filled with lines that pierce and prod and stay embedded inside your skin.&#x201d;<b>&#x2015;<i>NYLON </i></b></p><p>&#x201c;The first section of [<i>Brute</i>] ends with a poem of exile: self-imposed, absolutely necessary, freeing. . . . There&#x2019;s everything in this strong debut.&#x201d;<b>&#x2015;<i>The Millions </i></b></p><p>&#x201c;Emily Skaja reaches for nature in <i>Brute</i> to overcome the loss of an abusive lover, to overcome grief. . . . Skaja knows exactly how to engage nature, readers, and life. Her diverse poetics prove her broad range of skills. She takes risks. . . . All poems in <i>Brute</i> flow with precision and ease.&#x201d;<b>&#x2015;<i>The New York Journal of Books</i></b><br><i><b></b></i><br>&#x201c;Skaja&#x2019;s poems are both primal scream-songs and elegies to the end of a relationship. . . . With relentless, driving energy, Skaja&#x2019;s poems seek brutal truths while searching for meaningful transformation.&#x201d;<b>&#x2015;<i>Booklist </i></b></p><p>&#x201c;Emily Skaja&#x2019;s <i>Brute</i> is at once terrifying and hypnotic, strange and yet profoundly meaningful. . . . Skaja&#x2019;s strangeness is emotive and as such her complex poetry demands attention and easily enchants readers with the need to know more. Satisfied and panting, the reader is hooked&#x2015;this collection is nothing short of phenomenal.&#x201d;<b>&#x2015;<i>Crab Fat Magazine</i></b></p><p>&#x201c;The poems in Emily Skaja&#x2019;s <i>Brute</i> speak of brutality, of breaking, of endings, of beginnings. <i>Brute</i> is an elegy for a relationship&#x2019;s end, an intimate excavation, but also, these poems are a rhapsody, a rage. Skaja&#x2019;s poetry is deft, nimble, willing to inhabit contradictions&#x2015;&#x2018;What is this impulse in me to worship &amp; crucify / anyone who leaves me.&#x2019; Each poem is exquisitely crafted, visceral, indelible. <i>Brute</i> will cut right through you, cut deep, but the writing is so assured, so necessary, that you will welcome the wound.&#x201d;<b>&#x2015;Roxane Gay</b></p><p>&#x201c;<i>Brute</i>, though a collection of singular poems, is essentially one long, elegiac howl for the end of a relationship. It never lets up&#x2015;this living&#x2015;even when the world as we knew it is crushed. So what do we do with the brokenness? We document it, as Emily Skaja has done in <i>Brute</i>. We sing of the brokenness as we emerge from it. We sing the holy objects, the white moths that fly from our mouths, and we stand with the new, wet earth that has been created with our terrible songs.&#x201d;<b>&#x2015;Joy Harjo, judge&#x2019;s citation for the Walt Whitman Award</b></p></p><h2>Middlemarch (Signet Classics)</h2><p><p>"People are almost always better than their neighbours think they are"<br> <br> George Eliot&#x2019;s most ambitious novel is a masterly evocation of diverse lives and changing fortunes in a provincial community. Peopling its landscape are Dorothea Brooke, a young idealist whose search for intellectual fulfillment leads her into a disastrous marriage to the pedantic scholar Casaubon; the charming but tactless Dr Lydgate, whose pioneering medical methods, combined with an imprudent marriage to the spendthrift beauty Rosamond, threaten to undermine his career; and the religious hypocrite Bulstrode, hiding scandalous crimes from his past. As their stories interweave, George Eliot creates a richly nuanced and moving drama, hailed by Virginia Woolf as "one of the few English novels written for grown-up people".</p></p><p>Founded in 1906 by J.M. Dent, the Everyman Library has always tried to make the best books ever written available to the greatest number of people at the lowest possible price. Unique editorial features that help Everyman Paperback Classics stand out from the crowd include: a leading scholar or literary critic&#39;s introduction to the text, a biography of the author, a chronology of her or his life and times, a historical selection of criticism, and a concise plot summary. All books published since 1993 have also been completely restyled: all type has been reset, to offer a clarity and ease of reading unique among editions of the classics; a vibrant, full-color cover design now complements these great texts with beautiful contemporary works of art. But the best feature must be Everyman&#39;s uniquely low price. Each Everyman title offers these extensive materials at a price that competes with the most inexpensive editions on the market-but Everyman Paperbacks have durable binding, quality paper, and the highest editorial and scholarly standards.One of the most accomplished and prominent novels of the Victorian era, <i>Middlemarch</i> is an unsurpassed portrait of nineteenth-century English provincial life. Dorothea Brooke is a young woman of fervent ideals who yearns to effect social change yet faces resistance from the society she inhabits. In this epic in a small landscape, Eliot's large cast of precisely delineated characters and the rich tapestry of their stories result in a wise, compassionate, and astute vision of human nature. As Virginia Woolf declared, George Eliot "was one of the first English novelists to discover that men and women think as well as feel, and the discovery was of great artistic moment."<p><i>From the Trade Paperback edition.</i></p></p><h2>Field Guide to Edible Wild Plants</h2><p>Identifies more than one-hundred plants native to the United States and Canada and offers advice on harvesting and preparation</p><p>This is a field guide to edible wild plants.Bradford Angier is the author of numerous best-selling books on nature and outdoor living, including Field Guide to Medicinal Wild Plants (978-0-8117-2076-2), Wilderness Shelters and How to Build Them (978-1-5857-4430-5), and Looking for Gold (978-0-8117-2034-2).

Liu Pei, the legitimate heir to the Han throne, elects to fight for his birthright and enlists the aid of his sworn brothers, the impulsive giant Chang Fei and the invincible knight Kuan Yu. The brave band faces a formidable array of enemies, foremost among them the treacherous and bloodthirsty Ts'ao Ts'ao. The bold struggle of the three heroes seems doomed until the reclusive wizard Chuko Liang offers his counsel, and the tide begins to turn.<br><br><i>Romance of the Three Kingdoms</i> is China's oldest novel and the first of a great tradition of historical fiction. Believed to have been compiled by the play-wright Lo Kuan-chung in the late fourteenth century, it is indebted to the great <i>San-kuo chi</i> (Chronicles of the Three Kingdoms) completed by the historian Ch'en Shou just before his death in 297 CE. The novel first appeared in print in 1522. This edition, translated in the mid-1920s by C. H. Brewitt-Taylor, is based on a shortened and simplified version which appeared in the 1670s. An Introduction to this reprint by Robert E. Hegel, Professor of Chinese and Comparative Literature at Washington University, provides an insightful commentary on the historical background to the novel, its literary origins and its main characters.</p><p><b>Lo Kuan-chung</b> (c.1330-c.1400) was a novelist and dramatist who played an essential role in the development of Chinese popular fiction."One of the greatest and best-loved works of popular literature." &#x2014;<b><i>Dictionary of Oriental Literatures</i></b></p><h2>Altered States of Consciousness: A Book of Readings</h2><p>The study of the nature of human consciousness, a dormant and often taboo topic in psychology, is once again developing into a respected field of inquiry. This is the first book to provide a broad scientific point of view for the investigation of a variety of special states of consciousness. <br><br>The editor combines a humanistic approach, which includes an awareness of the great potential richness in human experience indicated by ASCs, with the disciplined precision of a scientist. He brings a professional point of view to the observation of the increasingly widespread use and resultant effects of drug, Yoga, self-hypnosis, and other means of producing ASCs which are popularly regarded as comprising either a major social problem or a sign of positive change in a materialistic civilization. <br><br>Studies of ASCs produced by psychedlic drugs, for example, are placed in this book within a broad, illuminating perspective that includes papers on mystical experiences, hypnagogic (between waking and sleeping) states, dream consciousness, meditation, hypnosis, and brain wave feedback-produced states. <br><br>In this volume, Professor Tart has brought together 35 scientific papers which illustrate the variety of ASCs and their effects, which describe some of the techniques, both ancient and modern, for producing ASCs and, perhaps most important, which show that ASCs can be studied scientifically without destroying their inherent human richness.</p><p></p><h2>Financial and Managerial Accounting</h2><p><p>Building on the success of the best-selling Fundamental Accounting Principles text, authors John Wild, Ken W.

Uses actual examples from existing firms to explain the value and limitations of models in order to illustrate key techniques. Features a thorough study of a wide range of firms in which direct application of typical models often breaks down--problems in valuing these companies are pinpointed and potential solutions suggested. Special sections deal with subtler valuation issues including the value of synergy in controlling mergers and the value of product options that firms may possess.Damodaran on Valuation Ideally, the price paid for any asset should reflect the expected cash flow on that asset&#x2014;but there are two problems that arise in every valuation. The first is that estimating cash flows is an exercise fraught with uncertainty, and the second is that picking the right model to use in valuing an asset is seldom easy. This can lead to significant errors in valuation. Sophisticated practitioners can accurately and consistently determine the value of all types of assets, when they rely on the seasoned advice found in Damodaran on Valuation. This applications-oriented tool covers the full range of available valuation models. It also presents the common elements within these models as well as the subtle variations, debunks the myth concerning their utility, and provides a framework for selecting the right model for any valuation scenario. Damodaran on Valuation systematically examines the three basic approaches to valuation&#x2014;discounted cash-flow valuation, relative valuation, and contingent claim valuation&#x2014;and the various models within these broad categories. With the help of numerous real-world examples involving both U.S. and international firms, the book illuminates the purpose of each particular model, its advantages and limitations, the step-by-step process involved in putting the model to work, and the kinds of firms to which it is best applied.

Acclaimed authors Tom L. Beauchamp and James F. Childress thoroughly develop and advocate for four principles that lie at the core of moral reasoning in health care: respect for autonomy, nonmaleficence, beneficence, and justice. Drawing from contemporary research--and integrating detailed case studies and vivid real-life examples and scenarios--they demonstrate how these prima facie principles can be expanded to apply to various conflicts and dilemmas, from how to deliver bad news to whether or not to withhold or withdraw life-sustaining treatments.<br><br>Illuminating both theory and method throughout, <em>Principles of Biomedical Ethics,</em> Seventh Edition, considers what constitutes moral character and addresses the problem of moral status: what rights are due to people and animals, and when. It also examines the professional-patient relationship, surveys major philosophical theories--including utilitarianism, Kantianism, rights theory, and virtue theory--and describes methods of moral justification in bioethics. Ideal for courses in biomedical ethics, bioethics, and health care ethics, the text is enhanced by hundreds of annotated citations and a substantial introduction that clarifies key terms and concepts.<br><br><strong>NEW TO THE SEVENTH EDITION</strong><br><br>Ch. 1: A clarified and more concise treatment of the common morality and its distinction from both particular moralities and the broad descriptive use of the term "morality"<br><br>Ch. 3: New sections on degrees of moral status and the moral significance of moral status<br><br>Ch. 4: A revised section on the therapeutic use of placebos and expanded coverage of theories of autonomy and information-processing issues<br><br>Ch. 5: New material on historical problems of underprotection and recent problems of overprotection in human subjects research<br><br>Ch. 6: A new section on expanded access and continued access in research and a relocated and integrated discussion of surrogate decision making for incompetent patients<br><br>Ch. 7: A distinction between traditional theories of justice and more recent theories like capabilities and well-being<br><br>Ch. 8: A new section on clinical ethics and research ethics<br><br>Ch. 9: A whole new section on virtue theory, which expands the account from Ch. 2 of the previous edition, and on rights theory<br><br>Ch. 10: An extended and more in-depth discussion of the authors' theory of method and justification in bioethics<br><br>A <strong>new Companion Website at www.oup.com/us/beauchamp</strong> featuring suggestions for effectively using the book in the classroom, possible syllabi and examination questions, additional readings, useful exercises, and cases for discussion</p><p><br><strong>Tom L.

There is nothing else like it in the field of bioethics. It has easily become over the years the most used, most praised, and most distinguished book in the field. Each edition moves beyond the previous ones in important and nuanced ways. Beauchamp and Childress keep up with the ever-changing terrain of bioethics, and work hard to refine their own arguments. It gets better and better. One can hardly ask for more."--Daniel Callahan, Director, International Program, <em>The Hastings Center</em><p></p><br>"What is by far the best general book on bioethics has gotten even better. The new material on international justice and virtue ethics is especially valuable. Such a combination of accessibility and rigor is rarely attained."--Allen Buchanan, James B. Duke Professor of Philosophy and James B. Duke Professor of Public Policy Studies, <em>Duke University</em><p></p><br>"This sixth edition of <em>Principles of Biomedical Ethics</em> reaffirms its undisputed stature as a canonical text for the world's bioethicists. It maintains a standard of scholarship and clarity appealing to neophytes and seasoned scholars, to adherents and critics of its principled approach."--Edmund D. Pellegrino, Chairman, <em>President's Council on Bioethics</em><p></p><br>"The contemporary field of bioethics is unimaginable, absent this text. <em>Principles of Biomedical Ethics</em> provided a paradigmatic approach that shaped the early character of bioethics. It continues to be a source of serious debate regarding the nature of morality and the significance of bioethics. No one can understand the field of bioethics apart from this volume."--H. Tristram Engelhardt, Jr., M.D., Professor, <em>Rice University</em> and <em>Baylor College of Medicine</em><p></p><br>"Like all of its previous incarnations, this new edition of <em>Principles of Biomedical Ethics</em> offers the reader a window onto the cutting edge of contemporary bioethics. Never content to merely recycle, buff, and slap new covers on old material, Beauchamp and Childress have once again rethought fundamental issues and fully engaged with their critics (including me). Beyond merely contributing to the field of bioethics, PBE has helped to define it."--John D. Arras, Porterfield Professor of Bioethics, <em>University of Virginia</em><p></p><br>"Every new edition of this classic gets better and better. This is essential reading for all students and scholars of bioethics."--Bernard Lo, M.D., Professor of Medicine and Director, Program in Medical Ethics, <em>University of California, San Francisco</em><p></p><br>"<em>Principles of Biomedical Ethics</em> has, over six successive editions, clarified and expanded the concepts, definitions, and arguments that make bioethics a discipline instead of random shards of opinion, sometimes astute, sometimes silly, that pass in the media for ethical commentary on medicine and science. This book is the thesaurus of bioethical discourse."--Albert R. Jonsen, Professor Emeritus, Department of Medical History and Ethics, <em>University of Washington</em><p></p><br>"The sixth edition of <em>Principles of Biomedical Ethics, </em> which more than any other book has helped to shape the field of biomedical ethics, is even better than the previous five editions. Beauchamp and Childress continue to listen to their critics, of whom I am one, and to change their book accordingly. Although I still have some problems with the theory of principlism, I have nothing but admiration for their comprehensive and detailed discussion of the moral problems that arise in the field of medicine."--Bernard Gert, Stone Professor of Intellectual and Moral Philosophy, <em>Dartmouth</em> <em>College</em><p></p><br>"Anyone with an interest in the field, including all those who have already been influenced by previous editions of <em>Principles of Biomedical Ethics--</em>and who in our field hasn't been, directly or indirectly?--should read the sixth edition. They will find the by-now familiar principles treated in new ways and, more importantly, thoughtful examinations of global health and of the relationship of vulnerability and exploitation to the often-neglected principle of justice. This book is now essential reading not only for those who grapple with clinical dilemmas and the challenges of biomedical research but also for anyone working on the frontiers of public health, where global epidemics and routine surveillance raise some of the most difficult issues in bioethics."--Alexander M.

It&#x2019;s well known that Claude Monet was a gourmand as well as an artistic genius. His culinary journals are filled with detailed recipes and notes about what he ate and with whom he shared his meals. Now, sixty of those recipes are gathered in this elegantly produced book brimming with the colors and flavors of Giverny, France. Each chapter features recipes that were served in Monet&#x2019;s famed yellow dining room, eaten al fresco in the gardens at Giverny, or at several of the fine restaurants along the Seine in Normandy. Beautiful reproductions of Monet&#x2019;s art compliment the recipes, along with photographs of the artist enjoying these dishes with his family, friends, and fellow artists. The recipes themselves, selected for their rustic appeal and use of only the freshest ingredients, range from simple galettes and hearty casseroles to fine soufflï¿½s, seafood dishes, and delicious tarts, cakes, and other pastries. A fitting tribute to the painter and his legendary aesthetic, this cookbook is the next best thing to sitting at Monet&#x2019;s table.</p><p>Florence Gentner was formerly special assistant to the Carnavalet Museum and the Maison de Victor Hugo.

Organized into four sections, the rustic recipes are inspired by Monet&#x2019;s culinary journals." <p>&#x2015;<i>Vogue</i></p><br><br>"Lushly-illustrated with the artist's artifacts, reproductions of his work, and photographs by Francis Hammond, the book includes 60 recipes based on descriptions in Monet&#x2019;s own cooking journals from his days in garden-rich Giverny. Readers can create modern takes on Monet's rustic fare." <p>&#x2015;<i>ArtFixDaily</i></p><br><br>"This beautiful book features Claude Monet&#x2019;s original recipes alongside stunning reproductions of his paintings, and moments from his life in Giverny. The recipes include a breadth of rustic and simple dishes, from comforting casseroles, sultry seafood dishes, and French tarts, pastries and cakes; an honour to Monet and his aesthetic, the Monet Cookbook is the next best thing to dining amongst him and company in his home." <i></i><p><i>-Chefsouschef</i></p><br><br>"If the title doesn&#x2019;t give it away, this food volume is a work of art in itself.

A New York Times bestseller, it is a valuable and practical primer on the principles behind the remarkable investment run of the famed oracle of Omaha. In this much-awaited companion to that book, author Robert Hagstrom takes the next logical step, revealing how to profitably manage stocks once you select them. THE WARREN BUFFETT PORTFOLIO will help you through the process of building a superior portfolio and managing the stocks going forward.<br> <br> Building a concentrated portfolio is critical for investment success. THE WARREN BUFFETT PORTFOLIO introduces the next wave of investment strategy, called focus investing. A comprehensive investment strategy used with spectacular results by Buffett, focus investing directs investors to select a concentrated group of businesses by examining their management and financial positions as compared to their stock prices. A strategy that has historically outperformed the market, focus investing is based on the principle that a shareholder's return from owning a stock is ultimately determined by the economics of the underlying business.<br> <br> Hagstrom explains in easy-to-understand terms exactly what focus investing is, how it works, and how it can be applied by any investor at any level of experience. He demonstrates how Buffett arranges his stocks in a focus portfolio and reveals why this is as responsible for his incredible returns as the individual stocks he picks. Ultimately, Hagstrom shows how to use this technique to build and manage a portfolio to achieve the best possible results.</p><p>It's no secret that most mutual funds fail to beat the performance of the S&amp;P 500. And if the pros can't beat the averages, it's not unreasonable to assume that most individual investors can't, either. Why? According to Robert Hagstrom, author of <i>The Warren Buffett Portfolio</i>, a big reason is the industry's emphasis on diversification. In the interest of minimizing risk, many investors have "become intellectually numb to its inevitable consequence: mediocre results." As a result, they wind up owning too many stocks and churn their portfolios unnecessarily (for example, the average mutual fund holds 100 stocks and turns over 80 percent of its portfolio annually). In <i>The Warren Buffett Portfolio</i>, Hagstrom shows how Buffett and others use the idea of <i>focus investing</i> to organize winning portfolios.<p> Unlike Hagstrom's first book, <i>The Warren Buffett Way</i>, which describes how the world's greatest investor selects individual companies, this book looks at the mathematics, the psychology, and the mental models necessary to build a successful portfolio. The basic ideas: Pick no more than 10 to 15 companies with good track records and high probabilities of future success; plan to hang onto them for at least five years; and ignore predictions and the sometimes terrifying swings in market behavior. It's hard to argue with Hagstrom's approach, especially when he practices what he preaches. His fund, the Legg Mason Focus Trust, has 15 stocks, an annual turnover rate of 9 percent, and percentage annual returns in the mid-30s. For thoughtful investors and devotees of Warren Buffett, who are looking for more than the next hot stock tip, <i>The Warren Buffett Portfolio</i> is well-written guide. Recommended. <i>--Harry C.

Born into the oppressive, colonialist society of 1930s Jamaica, white Creole heiress Antoinette Cosway meets a young Englishman who is drawn to her innocent beauty and sensuality. After their marriage, however, disturbing rumours begin to circulate which poison her husband against her. Caught between his demands and her own precarious sense of belonging, Antoinette is inexorably driven towards madness, and her husband into the arms of another novel&#39;s heroine. This classic study of betrayal, a seminal work of postcolonial literature, is Jean Rhys&#39;s brief, beautiful masterpiece. &#39;She took one of the works of genius of the nineteenth century and turned it inside-out to create one of the works of genius of the twentieth century&#39; Michele Roberts, The Times</p><p>In 1966 Jean Rhys reemerged after a long silence with a novel called <i>Wide Sargasso Sea</i>. Rhys had enjoyed minor literary success in the 1920s and '30s with a series of evocative novels featuring women protagonists adrift in Europe, verging on poverty, hoping to be saved by men. By the '40s, however, her work was out of fashion, too sad for a world at war. And Rhys herself was often too sad for the world--she was suicidal, alcoholic, troubled by a vast loneliness. She was also a great writer, despite her powerful self-destructive impulses.<p> <i>Wide Sargasso Sea</i> is the story of Antoinette Cosway, a Creole heiress who grew up in the West Indies on a decaying plantation. When she comes of age she is married off to an Englishman, and he takes her away from the only place she has known--a house with a garden where "the paths were overgrown and a smell of dead flowers mixed with the fresh living smell. Underneath the tree ferns, tall as forest tree ferns, the light was green. Orchids flourished out of reach or for some reason not to be touched."</p><p> The novel is Rhys's answer to <i>Jane Eyre</i>. Charlotte Brontï¿½'s book had long haunted her, mostly for the story it did not tell--that of the madwoman in the attic, Rochester's terrible secret. Antoinette is Rhys's imagining of that locked-up woman, who in the end burns up the house and herself. <i>Wide Sargasso Sea</i> follows her voyage into the dark, both from her point of view and Rochester's. It is a voyage charged with soul-destroying lust. "I watched her die many times," observes the new husband. "In my way, not in hers. In sunlight, in shadow, by moonlight, by candlelight. In the long afternoons when the house was empty."</p><p> Rhys struggled over the book, enduring rejections and revisions, wrestling to bring this ruined woman out of the ashes. The slim volume was finally published when she was 70 years old. The critical adulation that followed, she said, "has come too late." Jean Rhys died a few years later, but with <i>Wide Sargasso Sea</i> she left behind a great legacy, a work of strange, scary loveliness. There has not been a book like it before or since. Believe me, I've been searching. <i>--Emily White</i></p>6 1-hour cassettes</p><h2>I am Marie Curie (Ordinary People Change the World)</h2><p><b>The first woman to win a Nobel Prize, physicist and chemist Marie Curie is the 19th hero in the <i>New York Times </i>bestselling picture book biography series about heroes.</b><br><br>This friendly, fun biography series focuses on the traits that made our heroes great--the traits that kids can aspire to in order to live heroically themselves.

The deadly disease has decimated the ranks of both cadets and instructors, and the few survivors remain weak and frail.

But far from being a broken man, Nevare has made an astonishingly robust recovery from the Speck plague. Furthermore, while in the grip of the plague, he defeated his Speck nemesis, freeing himself, he believes, from the Speck magic that infected him. As he begins the journey to his ancestral home of Widevale, he is in high spirits, expecting a jubilant homecoming, a tender reunion with his beautiful fiancï¿½e, Carsina, and a bright future as a commissioned officer.</p><p>Yet back in the shelter of his family, Nevare finds his nights still haunted by visions of his Speck self betraying everything he holds dear in his waking life, and his days tormented by a rare side effect of the Speck plague that shames his family&#x2014;and repulses Carsina. Though he expected to slip back into his family fold effortlessly, Nevare finds himself instead caught between the sensual, enchanting realm of the Specks and his own ancestry, the world he has always known. </p><p>And then the magic in Nevare's blood&#x2014;magic that he thought he had destroyed&#x2014;roars to life, and he realizes that his most dangerous enemy, an enemy that seeks to destroy all he loves, might dwell <em>within him</em>. . . . </p></p><p><p>Robin Hobb was born in California but grew up in Alaska.

Using stories from his own life, Tim Wise shows that racism not only burdens people of color, but also benefits those who are "white like him" whether or not they&#x2019;re actively racist. Using stories instead of stale statistics, Wise weaves a compelling narrative that assesses the magnitude of racial privilege and is at once readable and scholarly, analytical yet accessible.</p><p><p><b>Tim Wise</b> is a prominent antiracist writer and activist who served as an advisor to the Fisk University Race Relations Institute. He lectures across the country about the need to combat institutional racism, gender bias, and the growing gap between rich and poor in the United States.</p>Activist, lecturer and director of the new Association for White Anti-Racist Education (AWARE), Wise works from anecdote rather than academic argument to recount his path to greater cultural awareness in a colloquial, matter-of-fact quasi-memoir that urges white people to fight racism "for <i>our own sake</i>." Sparing neither family nor self, Wise recalls a racist rant his antiracist mother once delivered, racial epithets uttered by his Alzheimer's-afflicted grandmother and the "conditioning" that leads him to wonder, for a split-second, if people of color are truly qualified for their jobs. He considers how the deck has always been stacked in his and other white people's favor: his grandmother's house, which served as collateral for a loan he needed for college, for instance, was in a neighborhood that had formerly barred blacks. Resistance to racism, Wise declares, requires support (it's better for a group to speak out against racial tracking than for one "crazy radical" to do it), and that's presumably part of what this volume means to provide. And while Wise sometimes falls victim to sweeping judgments&#x2014;the act of debating racial profiling, he declares, is "white-identified," because only whites have the luxury to look at life or death issues as a battle of wits&#x2014;his candor is invigorating. <br>Copyright ï¿½ Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

That same compassionate regard for ordinary people shines on every page of <b>Big Bad Love</b>, whose heroes in these stories have a fatal weakness for beer, fast women, and pick-up trucks, and who find a kind of salvation in the reckless pursuit of love.</p><p>"An entirely worthy successor [to <b>Dirty Work</b>], enlivened by a racy metaphor [and] invested with stunning presence and complexity."--<i>The New York Times Book Review</i><br><br>"Big, bad and wonderful...A stunning collection of stories about real people and real life."-- <i>Atlanta Journal And Constitution</i><br><br>"Rather like some perfect object one has come across in a wilderness, these are stories of affirmation...human, compassionate and compelling."-- Harry Crews, <i>Los Angeles Times</i><br><br>"A voice as true as a gun rack, unpretentious and uncorrupted.

In the rapidly descending darkness of a perfect June night, he pulled her into his arms and covered her mouth in a powerful kiss. Wow, she thought. It was a good kiss&#x2014;consuming and deep. His hands were running up and down her back. Then one slipped around her side, reaching for a breast, and she withdrew. She pushed him away, laughed nervously and said, "Hold on, pardner. Getting a little ahead of yourself, aren't you?"<br><br>"Sorry," he said. "I've been looking at you, wondering, you know..."<br><br>"Well, wonder no more, big fella&#x2014;rest assured I am definitely a girl. Now, don't we have plans? Live music in the park?"<br><br>"That's right," he said, laughing. Then, again, "Sorry."<br><br>As he walked her to his car, she said, "Girls don't get mad at guys for having romantic ideas. But you do have brakes, I assume?"<br><br>"Absolutely, Cassie."<br><br>"Good. You were moving a little fast for me."<br><br>The car was parked at the far end of the lot and she thought, Ahh, he's car proud. He'd rather walk across the lot than risk a dent or scratch from neighboring cars. He opened the door to the passenger side and she slipped in. She immediately pulled on her seat belt while he got in the driver's side.<br><br>He started the car, but didn't put it in gear. Instead, he reached over to her side and began to gently caress her upper arm. He leaned toward her across the console, his eyelids becoming heavy, his mouth slightly open. It was like kiss-on-demand, but at least he was moving more slowly, giving her time, waiting for her to respond. She met his lips for a sweet, short kiss. He moved over her mouth with precision, but when she pulled away from his mouth, laughing nervously again, he grabbed her upper arms in his strong grip. "Cassie," he said in a breath. "What do you say we rethink the music? Maybe skip it?"<br><br>"I don't think so. I was looking forward to it," she said, her heart rate speeding up a little. She started to smell an ill wind.<br><br>"Come on," he begged. "Think about it. You won't be sorry...."<br><br>She did a quick memory check. She'd been out for happy hour with friends from work when she met him. They'd talked for a long time. She was an emergency room nurse, he was a paramedic&#x2014;they'd never met before but she did a lot of business with the fire department and had come to think of them as the good guys. He had been polite, attentive, interested. He was a nice-looking guy with a sense of humor. She'd taken his cell phone number and agreed to meet him again, this time for a cup of coffee. That's how you play safe dating. He'd been a gentleman, walking her to her car after coffee and saying goodbye with a brief, platonic hug. Then she'd given him <em>her </em>cell phone number. So, after a few getting-to-know-you conversations, she'd accepted a date for live music in the park. She still hadn't let him pick her up; they'd agreed to meet at a bar because finding each other in a park full of people could be difficult.<br><br>His behavior now took her by surprise. She'd have to back him down quick. She'd been attracted to him, but no way was she ready to take this to the next level.<br><br>"I don't have to think about it," she said, her palms pressed firmly against his chest. "I was looking forward to some music. It's a beautiful night. And what you apparently have in mind is not on the agenda in the parking lot of the&#x2014;"<br><br>Her words were cut off as he slipped a big hand around the back of her head and pulled her, roughly, onto his mouth. She pushed at him, making unintelligible sounds beneath his lips, but he was actually <em>climbing </em>across the console while silencing her with his mouth. For a guy about six feet tall, this was unimaginable, but he seemed to do it with ease. In seconds, he was straddling her hips, towering over her so fast she hardly knew what was happening.<br><br>"Hey!" she said when he released her lips. "Hey, what are you <em>doing?"</em><br><br>She was thinking quickly. There were a few cars around his, but he had parked away from the crowd and his windows were darkly tinted. Her next thought was, How is this possible? This is a nice guy! This is a paramedic! My best friend's husband is a paramedic; I know a lot of their friends! They're salt of the earth&#x2014; angels!<br><br>But he was pressing her back against the seat, devouring her mouth, breathing real hard and fast through his nose. He popped her seat belt off and although she pushed and her protests were lost as whimpers beneath his mouth, she was focused on the logistics of his attack. He couldn't possibly plan to rape her in the front bucket seat of an SUV? She was wearing shorts; freeing her from her clothes would not be simple!<br><br>Then her seat began to recline&#x2014;he had his hand on the button. He was slowly laying her down. She was beginning to understand his plan. If he got her flat, he could pull down her shorts. If he raped her and let her loose, if he didn't leave bruises or marks, he'd claim she wasn't forced. She'd run her share of rape kits in the E.R., heard her share of he-said-she-said stories while a skeptical detective took notes. Well, by God, she was at least going to force him to leave bruises! She began to kick and push and wiggle, throwing her head and body wildly back and forth, side to side.<br><br>"Stop it," he said. "Stop it now. Come on. We know what we want!"<br><br>"Get <em>off me, </em>you son of a bitch!"<br><br>"Aw, Cassie," he laughed, as if she'd uttered some kind of endearment. "Baby, come on&#x2014;I'm totally into you!"<br><br>"You're <em>crazy! </em>Let me go! Get off me! <em>Now!"</em><br><br>"Come on, come on, settle down...."<br><br><em>"No!" </em>she screamed. Just scream, she told herself. Bite, kick, scream, yell, hit, gouge, anything. She pushed at him with one hand, searching for the door handle with the other. Then, failing to find it, she pounded on the window, hoping to break it, screeching and turning her head away from his mouth so she could get volume. She tried head butting him, but he held her shoulders down and lifted his head back, and he <em>laughed. </em>She was moving around so violently, the car was actually bouncing. He tried to grab her wrist but she socked him in the eye. He grunted in pain and growled, but he didn't hit back. She continued banging on the window and yelling. She knew one thing&#x2014;he couldn't get her out of this parking lot without moving to his side of the car, over that console, and by God she was going to fling herself out of the car before he could take her anywhere.<br><br>Suddenly there was a sharp rapping on her window. "Hey!" someone with a deep male voice yelled. "Hey!"<br><br>"Oh, God," she cried, suddenly overcome with relief and hope. <em>"Help!" </em>she screamed. <em>"Hel&#x2014;!" </em>And then Ken put his hand over her mouth.<br><br>Ken lowered the window an inch. "Hey, go away, pal. We're busy!" And he powered the window back up.<br><br>Cassie bit his hand as hard as she could and he jumped so abruptly, he hit his head on the ceiling of the car.<br><br>Cassie heard the man with the deep voice try to open the locked door. Then the window's glass suddenly cracked and, like a spiderweb, spread into a million cracks. But it was tempered glass and didn't break, merely crystallized, leaving a dent in the glass where it had been hit. A sharp object she vaguely recognized as a key popped through the compromised glass and started boring a hole into it, releasing diamondlike pebbles of glass that fell into the car. Ken decided to return to the driver's seat. "What the hell are you doing, man?" he screamed at the intruder.<br><br>A huge hand attached to a huge arm entered through the hole in the window and reached down to flip the lock. The door opened instantly and Cassie stumbled out. She was gasping as she looked into a face far more frightening than Ken's. This was a giant wearing a tight white T-shirt covered by a black leather vest adorned with chains. On the arm that had freed her was a tattoo of a naked lady. He had a lot of facial hair&#x2014;long, thick sideburns and a handlebar moustache that framed his mouth. His hair was pulled back into a ponytail. With his hands on her elbows to help her stand upright, he asked, "You hurt?" His voice was very menacing; he frowned blackly. Cassie was five-three and this guy had a foot on her, at least.<br><br>"No," she said, gasping. "Yes. I mean, no. He..." She couldn't finish.<br><br>He pulled her away from the SUV and turned her around so that he stood between her and the car. "You need the police? Or the hospital?" he asked as he pulled a cell phone out of his pants pocket.<br><br>"No," she said, shaking her head. "You were in time." Then she hiccupped and choked; a fat tear ran down her cheek. "Oh, God!"<br><br>"Can I call someone for you?" he asked, his voice miraculously softer.<br><br>Suddenly the SUV was in gear, and Ken&#x2014;the polite, salt-of-the-earth paramedic&#x2014;took off. The passenger door slowly drifted closed as the car banked and turned, leaving some skid marks behind.<br><br>"My purse..." she whimpered.<br><br>Suddenly the SUV skidded to a stop just before exiting the parking lot. Through the broken passenger door window flew an object, crashing to the ground. Then the car sped away. "Your purse," the big guy said. "Stay here." He walked across the parking lot, squatted to return scattered items from her purse back into it, then brought it back to her. "Here you go," he said, holding it out.<br><br>Cassie looked up at the guy who had saved her. A biker dude. He looked scruffy and scary, like he could be a Hells Angel or something. But Ken, so clean-cut, turned out to be the dangerous one.<br><br>"God," she said. "I never saw that coming. If you hadn't..."<br><br>"You okay? Because I can call the police. I got the plate number."<br><br>"I wasn't hurt&#x2014;just scared to death. I swear, that shouldn't have happened."<br><br>"It looked pretty bad there for a minute."<br><br>"For a minute, it <em>was </em>pretty bad. I think maybe he was going to&#x2014;" She stopped. She couldn't say it.<br><br>"Hey, now. You sure you're okay?" the guy asked again.<br><br>Cassie fished around in her purse for her keys, her hands shaking. "Yeah," she said with a sniff. "I'll be fine. I think."<br><br>"You want me to follow you home or something? Make sure you don't have any trouble?"<br><br>She let a huff of laughter escape through her tears. Imagine having a guy like <em>this </em>follow her, know where she lived? Suddenly the world didn't make any sense. "I won't go straight home. I'll go to my girlfriend's. She has a protective German shepherd and a six-foot-two-inch husband."<br><br>"You sure you don't want to just check in with the police?" he asked, his brows furrowing. "Talk to them about it?"<br><br>"She also has three kids," Cassie said.<br><br>The big man laughed, a deep and rumbling sound. "Well, I guess that oughta hold anyone back."<br><br>Another laugh puffed out of Cassie, but then she instantly plummeted into tears. Loud tears. Her purse dropped from her hands and she leaned against him, wailing.<br><br>"Whoa, kiddo," he said. "I think maybe I should buy you a cup of coffee, get you a little straightened out before you drive...."<br><br>"I'm not... I wasn't... I haven't been drinking or anything," she finally choked out.<br><br>"I didn't mean to sober you up," he said with a laugh. He bent down and picked up the purse and then, with a big arm draped around her shoulders, he gently, protectively, led her back toward the bar.<br><br>Looking up at him, she asked, "What if he comes back?"<br><br>"He's not coming back," the man said. "You're okay for now. Come on, let's have a cup of coffee. Calm down a little. Then you go on to your girlfriend's. Huh?"<br><br>By the time he got all that out, they were nearly at the door to the bar. She wiped at her cheeks, her eyes. "I really don't know what to do," she said.<br><br>"I know," he answered. "Coffee, that's what we do."<br><br>In just a few minutes she was sitting in a corner booth, staring into a cup of black coffee, across from one big, mean-looking biker. And he had a cup of coffee, too.<br><br>Cassie could hardly lift her head; she was exhausted, frightened, wrung out, relieved. But as she slowly realized what she really was, she looked up in some surprise, right into the amazing blue eyes of her rescuer. "God, I'm so <em>embarrassed," </em>she said in a breath.<br><br>"You shouldn't be embarrassed," he said. "You didn't attack him. He should be embarrassed, but he's probably not. Bet he's scared, though."<br><br>"Of you?"<br><br>"Not necessarily. You know, it's not too late to call the police. My little brother's a cop, actually. He's not working tonight, but we could still call him. He'd be good for some advice, at least." Then he laughed. "Of all us boys, he was about the worst one. Figures he'd turn into a cop. And a real hard-case cop, too. Not a lot of gray area with him. Listen, how well do you know that guy?"<br><br>"Apparently not well enough," she said, shaking her head. "We met at happy hour, then had a coffee date and talked on the phone quite a bit. He works with people I know. I guess."<br><br>"You guess?"<br><br>"Well, he said he was a paramedic and my best friend's husband is a paramedic. I know a lot of their friends. I thought we had mutual friends. Jeez. What if he was just lying?"<br><br>"License plates don't lie."<br><br>"How did you know to help me?"<br><br>He smiled. "You're kidding, right? I <em>heard </em>you. The car was rocking. Two people in the front seat? I figured if it was consensual, you'd both be in the backseat." He shrugged. "It was worth checking out."<br><br>"What did you use to break that window?"<br><br>He lifted a hand. He stared at his own knuckles for a second. They were bruised and swelling.<br><br>"Holy cow," she said. "Are <em>you </em>okay?"<br><br>"Yeah. It'll be fine." Then he grinned. "Maybe he'll try to sue me or something, huh? I'd love that. So, I'm Walt. Walt Arneson."<br><br>"Cassie," she said. Then she shook her head. "You must think I'm pretty stupid."<br><br>"Doesn't sound like it," he answered.<br><br></p><h2>Green Dragon Codex (The Dragon Codices)</h2><p>Fall in love with an evil baby dragon in the next dragon codex!<br><br>When ten-year-old Scamp Weaver finds a locked chest in a forest clearing, he feels like his life is finally about to change for the better.

There, only forty miles from the Canadian border and freedom, Chief Joseph, convinced that the wounded and elders could go no farther, walked across the snowy battlefield, handed his rifle to the U.S. military commander who had been pursuing them, and spoke his now-famous words, "From where the sun now stands, I will fight no more forever."</p><p>The story has been told many times, but never before in its entirety or with such narrative richness. Drawing on four years of research, interviews, and 20,000 miles of travel, Nerburn takes us beyond the surrender to the captives' unlikely welcome in Bismarck, North Dakota, their tragic eight-year exile in Indian Territory, and their ultimate return to the Northwest. Nerburn reveals the true, complex character of Joseph, showing how the man was transformed into a myth by a public hungry for an image of the noble Indian and how Joseph exploited the myth in order to achieve his single goal of returning his people to their homeland.</p><p><em>Chief Joseph &amp; the Flight of the Nez Perce</em> is far more than the story of a man and a people. It is a grand saga of a pivotal time in our nation's history. Its pages are alive with the presence of Lewis and Clark, General William Tecumseh Sherman, General George Armstrong Custer, and Sitting Bull. Its events brush against the California Gold Rush, the Civil War, the great western pioneer migration, and the building of the telegraph and the transcontinental railroad. Once you have read this groundbreaking work, you will never look at Chief Joseph, the American Indian, or our nation's westward journey in the same way again.</p></p><p><p>Kent Nerburn has been widely praised as one of the few writers who can respectfully bridge the gap between native and nonnative cultures. His book <em>Neither Wolf nor Dog: On Forgotten Roads with an Indian Elder</em> won the 1995 Minnesota Book Award.</p>Chapter One <p>"We Thought They Might Be Descended from Dogs" The nez perce first encountered the European world, and the Europeans first encountered theirs, in a wide, pine-rimmed meadow in the foothills of the Bitterroot Mountains on a sunlit day in the autumn of 1805. There, in a flower-covered field called the Weippe Prairie, in the state we now call Idaho, three young Nez Perce boys were lazily playing with sticks and bows while their mothers and grandmothers dug camas roots on the far side of the clearing. It was the autumn gathering time, and the roots they dug would be dried and pulverized and made into meal for bread. A good harvest meant a good winter, and this year the harvest was good. </p><p>Smoke rose from fires near the buffalo-skin teepees, which were set in the same places they had been set for as long as anyone could remember. Each family had its own spot, each band its own area. The gathering had the gentle grace of a yearly ritual, when the different bands of the tribe came together from their distant homelands to share in the harvest, to meet family and friends, and to offer the firstfruits of the camas gathering in thanks to the earth for the bounty she had given. </p><p>Only women and children and elders were in the camp. The younger men had gone off across the rugged hills toward the south to confront the Shoshone, who had killed three Nez Perce peace emissaries the season before. It would be some time before they would return, and by that time the harvest would be finished and the bands would be ready to return to their respective wintering grounds in the lower valleys, where the snow seldom reached and the waters seldom froze. The sun was warm, the digging was good, and the day had an air of quietude and peace. </p><p>Through this golden autumn peace the three boys heard the snorts of horses and saw a glint of movement in the woods on a nearby hillside. Soon a figure emerged, then another and another, all on horseback, all unlike any the boys had ever seen. They had arms like men, legs like men. But their faces were covered with fur, like dogs. One of the figures had hair the color of sunset. Another was black and had hair like a buffalo. He looked like a warrior painted for night battle, except that the blackness was not paint but skin itself. </p><p>The boys tried to run, but the creature with the sunset hair caught up with them. He made gestures of peace with his hands and gave them lengths of red ribbon. He motioned for them to return to camp and bring back the leaders of the people. </p><p>The boys arrived at the lodges breathless and terrified. They pointed to the field and told of the pale beasts with the hairy faces and held up the ribbons they had been given. In the Nez Perce fashion, the youngest boy was asked to deliver the worst news about these beasts they had encountered. He huddled with the other boys for a moment, then turned and spoke solemnly. "They all had eyes like dead fish," he said. </p><p>The strangers were led back to camp, where everyone gathered around them. They seemed by all accounts to be men, though not of any tribe that had ever been seen before. Their language was not recognizable and their condition was barely above that of animals. They were filthy and squalid and gave off a repulsive odor. With their hairy faces, there was some thought that they might be descended from dogs. </p><p>The "sunset hair" acted as the leader. He seemed friendly and offered gifts. Most important, he and the others with him carried guns with long barrels, a mysterious weapon of which the Nez Perce had only recently learned. Earlier that year, a band of hunters who had gone across the mountains to the buffalo country had traded for six of these strange weapons and brought them back to the Nez Perce villages. They spoke in awe of what these guns could do&#x2014;about the terrific noise they made and how a ball placed in the long barrel could kill an animal from a distance far greater than that reached by an arrow. </p><p>The Nez Perce had long been known as the makers of the finest bows and arrows of any tribe, having learned to steam the horn of the mountain ram until it softened, then to shape it into a bow and strengthen it with rawhide attached with the boiled blood of the sturgeon or the grease from the skin of the salmon. Once hardened, these bows were powerful enough to launch an arrow completely through the body of a deer. All the tribes with whom the Nez Perce traded were hungry to obtain them. </p><p>But these long-barreled guns were even more powerful&#x2014;perhaps not as efficient for warfare, but well able to pierce the leather shields of enemies and quite capable of stopping attackers and terrifying horses at a great distance. That these beings had these guns spoke of great power and influence, whether in fact they were men or beasts. </p><p>The dog-men were led down the hill to the camp of Twisted Hair, a chief who had been too old to go off on the raiding party against the Shoshone. Though frightened, he greeted the strangers with hospitality, feeding them a meal of camas roots and salmon. They seemed both appreciative and friendly. </p><p>While the strangers ate and slept, the situation was discussed in council. There was some thought to kill them, because stories had long been told about strange, pale-skinned men coming from the east who would bring sickness and ruin. But one old woman called Watkueis, or "She Who Had Returned from a Far Country," spoke to spare their lives.</p></p><h2>William Maxwell: Early Novels and Stories</h2><p>With his second book,&nbsp;<i>They Came Like Swallows</i>&nbsp;(1937), William Maxwell found his signature subject matter&#x2014;the fragility of human happiness&#x2014;as well as his voice, a quiet, cadenced Midwestern voice that John Updike has called one of the wisest and kindest in American fiction. Set against the background of the Spanish flu epidemic of 1918, this short novel presents the loving character of Elizabeth Morison, a devoted wife and mother, through the eyes of those whom she is fated to leave decades before her time.<br><br>Edmund Wilson described&nbsp;<i>The Folded Leaf</i>&nbsp;(1945) as &#x201c;a quite unconventional study of adolescent relationships&#x2014;between two boys, with a girl in the offing&#x2014;in Chicago and in a Middle Western college: very much lived and very much seen.&#x201d; He praised this &#x201c;drama of the immature&#x201d; for the compassion Maxwell brings to his male protagonists, whose intensely felt, unarticulated bond is beyond their inchoate ability to understand.<br><br><i>Time Will Darken It</i>&nbsp;(1948) is a drama of the mature: a good man&#x2019;s struggle to keep duty before desire and his family&#x2019;s needs before his own. It paints a portrait of Draperville, Illinois, in 1912, a proud and isolated community governed by gossip, where an ambitious young woman must not overreach the limits society has placed on her sex, and an older, married gentleman must not encourage her should she dare.<br><br>Together with these major works, this Library of America edition of Maxwell&#x2019;s early fiction collects his lighthearted first novel,&nbsp;<i>Bright Center of Heaven</i>&nbsp;(1934), out of print for nearly 70 years, and nine masterly short stories.

Johnson, a noted lecturer and Jungian analyst, is also the author of <em>He, She, We, Inner Work, Ecstasy, Transformation,</em> and <em>Owning Your Own Shadow. </em></p><p><b>Chapter One</b></p><p><b>Alternative Realities: The World of Dreaming, the Realm of Imagination</b></p><p>Our verbal patterns betray many of our automatic assumptions: If one discusses a dream with a friend, the friend is likely to ask something like, "Did that detail <i>really</i> happen, or only in the dream?" The implication is that what happens in a dream is not .'real." In fact, it would be more accurate to ask, "Did it happen in dream reality, or in physical reality? In the world of dreaming, or in the ordinary world?"</p><p>Both are genuine worlds, both are realities that truly exist. But the world of dreaming, if we only realized it, has more practical and concrete effect on our lives than outer events do. For it is in the world of dreaming that the unconscious is working out its powerful dynamics. It is there that the great forces do battle or combine to produce the attitudes, ideals, beliefs, and compulsions that motivate most of our behavior.</p><p>Once we become sensitive to dreams, we discover that every dynamic in a dream is manifesting itself in some way in our practical lives-in our actions, relationships, decisions, automatic routines, urges, and feelings. We believe ourselves to be in conscious control of these elements of life. But this belief is the great illusion of ego-control. These aspects of our lives are actually determined from a far deeper place. It is in the world of <i>dreaming</i> that their root sources are revealed in a form that we can see and understand.</p><p>Dreams express the unconscious. Dreams are dynamic mosaics, composed of symbols, that express the movements, conflicts, interactions, and developments of the great energy systems within the unconscious.</p><p>The unconscious has a particular capacity to create images and to use those images as symbols. It is these symbols that form our dreams, creating a language by which the unconscious communicates its contents to the conscious mind.</p><p>just as a burning fire inherently exudes heat, the unconscious inherently generates symbols. It is simply the nature of the unconscious to do so. As we learn to read those symbols we gain the ability to perceive the workings of the unconscious within us. This ability to produce symbols affects more than just our dreams: All of human life is nourished by the flow of symbolic imagery from the wellsprings in the unconscious:</p><p>The symbolic imagery of the unconscious is the creative source of the human spirit in all its realizations. Not only have consciousness and the concepts of its philosophical understanding of the world arisen from the symbol but also religion, rite and cult, art and customs. And because the symbol-forming process of the unconscious is the source of the human spirit, language, whose history is almost identical with the genesis and development of human consciousness, always starts out as a symbolic language. Thus Jung writes: "An archetypal content expresses itself, first and foremost, in metaphors." (Neumann, Great Mother, p. 17)</p><p>The image-symbols of the unconscious find their way to the level of consciousness mainly by two routes: dreams and imagination. It is easier to grasp the symbolic quality with dreams, for dreams often present mythical creatures and unearthly situations that would be impossible in everyday physical life. People are usually confused by the dream images until they learn that the images are symbolic and are not to be taken literally.</p><p>Since dream images make no sense in ordinary terms, people dismiss them as "weird" or meaningless, but actually, dreams are completely coherent. If we take the time to learn their language, we discover that every dream is a masterpiece of symbolic communication. The unconscious speaks in symbols, not to confuse us, but simply because that is its native idiom.</p><p>I was never able to agree ... that the dream is a "facade" behind which its meaning lies hidden -- a meaning already known but maliciously, so to speak, withheld from consciousness. To me, dreams are a part of nature, which harbors no intention to deceive, but expresses something as best it can, just as a plant grows or an animal seeks its food as best it can. These forms of life, too, have no wish to deceive our eyes, but we may deceive ourselves because our eyes are shortsighted. Long before I met Freud I regarded the Unconscious, and dreams, which are its direct exponents, as natural processes to which no arbitrariness can be attributed, and above all, no legerdemain. (lung, MDR, p. 161)</p><p></p><p>We may compare a dream to a screen on which the unconscious projects its inner drama. We see there the various inner personalities that make up much of our total character, the dynamics among the forces that make up the unconscious. These invisible forces and their activities set off charges, so to speak, that are transmitted onto the screen. They take the form of images, and the interplay of the dream images gives us an exact representation of those inner dynamics that go on inside us.</p><p>In learning how to understand these images, our conceptual starting point is our realization that they are not to be taken liter-, ally: We learn to look for an attitude, an inner personality, an inner development or conflict that clothes itself in the form and color of this image so that it may be visible to us in the Land of Dreaming.</p></p><h2>The Book of Old Silver: English, American, Foreign with All Available Hallmarks including Sheffield Plate Marks</h2><p>The Book of Old Silver: English, American, Foreign -- with All Available Hallmarks Including Sheffield Plate Marks is a history and guide to Old Silver and Old Sheffield Plate, with the most comprehensive table of hallmarks ever published in one book.

Ella must obey any order, whether it's to hop on one foot for a day and a half, or to chop off her own head! But strong-willed Ella does not accept her fate...</p><p>Against a bold backdrop of princes, ogres, giants, wicked stepsisters, and fairy godmothers, Ella goes on a quest to break the curse forever.</p></p><p>Every child longs for the day when he or she will be free from meddling parents and bossy grownups. For young Ella, the heroine of Gail Carson Levine's Newbury Honor-winning debut novel, this is more than a fanciful wish; it could be a matter of life or death. Placed under the spell of a blundering fairy, she has no choice but to go through life obeying each and every order--no matter what the consequences may be. "If you commanded me to cut off my own head, I'd have to do it." <p> Eden Riegel (<i>As the World Turns</i>, <i>Les Miserables</i>) uses her youthful, energetic voice to lead the listener into a familiar world of fairy godmothers, wicked stepsisters, and handsome princes. But this imaginative retelling of the Cinderella story comes with a welcome twist. Instead of a demure heroine patiently awaiting a prince who will carry her off, this Ella is a feisty ball of fire with the courage and ambition to take matters into her own hands.</p><p> Riegel narrates in a youthful, energetic tone that is perfectly suited to Ella's character. Her voice adds charm and immediacy to a wonderful story already rich with excitement, adventure, romance, and mystery.

I stopped.</i> <br><br>So begins this richly entertaining story of Ella of Frell, who wants nothing more than to be free of Lucinda's gift and feel that she belongs to herself.&nbsp;&nbsp;For how can she truly belong to herself if she knows that at any time, anyone can order her to hop on one foot, cut off her hand, or betray her kingdom--and she'll have to obey? <br><br>Against a bold tapestry of princes, ogres, giants, wicked stepsisters, and fairy godmothers, Ella's spirited account of her quest to break the curse is a funny, poignant, and enchanting tale about an unforgettable heroine who is determined to be herself.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Eden Riegel provided the voice of Young Miriam in the animated feature film <i>Prince of Egypt,</i> and has appeared in the film <i>Into the Woods.</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Her television credits include recurring roles on <i>New York Undercover, As the World Turns</i> and <i>Guiding Light.</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;On Broadway, she was one of the original cast members of <i>Les Miserables</i> and performed in <i>The Will Rogers Follies.</i></p><h2>The Collected Plays of Peter Shaffer</h2><p>Collected plays of Peter Shaffer</p><p></p><h2>The Heart Goes Last: A Novel</h2><p><b>Margaret Atwood puts the human heart to the ultimate test in an utterly brilliant new novel that is as visionary as&nbsp;<i>The Handmaid's Tale</i>&nbsp;and as richly imagined as&nbsp;<i>The Blind Assassin</i>.</b><br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stan and Charmaine are a married couple trying to stay afloat in the midst of an economic and social collapse. Job loss has forced them to live in their car, leaving them vulnerable to roving gangs. They desperately need to turn their situation around&#x2014;and fast. The Positron Project in the town of Consilience seems to be the answer to their prayers. No one is unemployed and everyone gets a comfortable, clean house to live in . . . for six months out of the year. On alternating months, residents of Consilience must leave their homes and function as inmates in the Positron prison system. Once their month of service in the prison is completed, they can return to their "civilian" homes.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At first, this doesn't seem like too much of a sacrifice to make in order to have a roof over one's head and food to eat. But when Charmaine becomes romantically involved with the man who lives in their house during the months when she and Stan are in the prison, a series of troubling events unfolds, putting Stan's life in danger. With each passing day, Positron looks less like a prayer answered and more like a chilling prophecy fulfilled.</p><p>MARGARET ATWOOD, whose work has been published in thirty-five countries, is the author of more than forty books of fiction, poetry, and critical essays.

Being a third-hand Honda, it&#x2019;s no palace to begin with. If it was a van they&#x2019;d have more room, but fat chance of affording one of those, even back when they thought they had money. Stan says they&#x2019;re lucky to have any kind of a car at all, which is true, but their luckiness doesn&#x2019;t make the car any bigger.<br><br>Charmaine feels that Stan ought to sleep in the back because he needs more space--it would only be fair, he&#x2019;s larger--but he has to be in the front in order to drive them away fast in an emergency. He doesn&#x2019;t trust Charmaine&#x2019;s ability to function under those circumstances: he says she&#x2019;d be too busy screaming to drive. So Charmaine can have the more spacious back, though even so she has to curl up like a snail because she can&#x2019;t exactly stretch out.<br><br>They keep the windows mostly closed because of the mosquitoes and the gangs and the solitary vandals. The solitaries don&#x2019;t usually have guns or knives--if they have those kinds of weapons you have to get out of there triple fast--but they&#x2019;re more likely to be bat-shit crazy, and a crazy person with a piece of metal or a rock or even a high-heeled shoe can do a lot of damage. They&#x2019;ll think you&#x2019;re a demon or the undead or a vampire whore, and no kind of reasonable thing you might do to calm them down will cancel out that opinion. The best thing with crazy people, Grandma Win used to say--the only thing, really--is to be somewhere else.<br><br>With the windows shut except for a crack at the top, the air gets dead and supersaturated with their own smells. There aren&#x2019;t many places where they can grab a shower or wash their clothes, and that makes Stan irritable. It makes Charmaine irritable too, but she tries her best to stamp on that feeling and look on the bright side, because what&#x2019;s the use of complaining?<br><br>What&#x2019;s the use of anything? she often thinks. But what&#x2019;s the use of even thinking What&#x2019;s the use? So instead she says, &#x201c;Honey, let&#x2019;s just cheer up!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Why?&#x201d; Stan might say. &#x201c;Give me one good fucking reason to cheer the fuck up.&#x201d; Or he might say, &#x201c;Honey, just shut it!&#x201d; mimicking her light, positive tone, which is mean of him. He can lean to the mean when he&#x2019;s irritated, but he&#x2019;s a good man underneath. Most people are good underneath if they have a chance to show their goodness: Charmaine is determined to keep on believing that. A shower is a help for the showing of the goodness in a person, because, as Grandma Win was in the habit of saying, Cleanliness is next to godliness and godliness means goodliness.<br><br>That was among the other things she might say, such as Your mother didn&#x2019;t kill herself, that was just talk. Your daddy did the best he could but he had a lot to put up with and it got too much. You should try hard to forget those other things, because a man&#x2019;s not accountable when he&#x2019;s had too much to drink. And then she would say, Let&#x2019;s make popcorn!<br><br>And they would make the popcorn, and Grandma Win would say, Don&#x2019;t look out the window, sugar pie, you don&#x2019;t want to see what they&#x2019;re doing out there. It isn&#x2019;t nice. They yell because they want to. It&#x2019;s self-expression. Sit here by me. It all worked out for the best, because look, here you are and we&#x2019;re happy and safe now!<br><br>That didn&#x2019;t last, though. The happiness. The safeness. The now.<br>WHERE?<br><br>Stan twists in the front seat, trying to get comfortable. Not much fucking chance of that. So what can he do? Where can they turn? There&#x2019;s no safe place, there are no instructions. It&#x2019;s like he&#x2019;s being blown by a vicious but mindless wind, aimlessly round and round in circles. No way out.<br><br>He feels so lonely, and sometimes having Charmaine with him makes him feel lonelier. He&#x2019;s let her down.<br><br>He has a brother, true, but that would be a last resort. He and Conor had followed different paths, was the polite way of saying it. A drunken midnight fight, with dickheads and douchebags and shit-for-brains freely exchanged, would be the impolite way of saying it, and it was in fact the way Conor had chosen during their last encounter. To be accurate, Stan had chosen that way too, though he&#x2019;d never had as foul a mouth as Con.<br><br>In Stan&#x2019;s view--his view at that time--Conor was next door to a criminal. But in Con&#x2019;s view Stan was a dupe of the system, an ass-kisser, a farce, and a coward. Balls of a tadpole.<br><br>Where&#x2019;s slippery Conor now, what&#x2019;s he doing? At least he won&#x2019;t have lost his job in the big financial-crash business-wrecking meltdown that turned this part of the country into a rust bucket: you can&#x2019;t lose your job if you don&#x2019;t have one. Unlike Stan, he hasn&#x2019;t been expelled, cast out, condemned to a life of frantic, grit-in-the-eyes, rancid-armpit wandering. Con always lived off what he could mooch or filch from others, ever since he was a kid. Stan hasn&#x2019;t forgotten his Swiss Army knife that he&#x2019;d saved up for, his Transformer, his Nerf gun with the foam bullets: magical disappearances all, with Con&#x2019;s younger-brother head going shake shake shake from side to side, no way, who, me?<br><br>Stan wakes at night thinking for a moment that he&#x2019;s home in bed, or at least in a bed of some sort. He reaches for Charmaine, but she isn&#x2019;t there beside him and he finds himself inside the stinking car, needing a piss but afraid to unlock the door because of the voices yammering toward him and the footsteps crunching on gravel or thudding on asphalt, and maybe a fist thumping on the roof and a scarred, partly toothed face grinning in the window: Lookit what we got! Cockfodder! Let&#x2019;s open &#x2019;er up! Gimme the crowbar!<br><br>And then Charmaine&#x2019;s terrified little whisper: &#x201c;Stan! Stan! We need to go! We need to go right now!&#x201d; As if he couldn&#x2019;t figure that out for himself. He keeps the key in the ignition, always. Rev of motor, screech of tires, yelling and jeering, pounding of heart, and then what? More of the same in some other parking lot or sidestreet, somewhere else. It would be nice if he had a machine gun: nothing any smaller would even come close. As it is, his only weapon is flight.<br><br>He feels pursued by bad luck, as if bad luck is a feral dog, lurking along behind him, following his scent, lying in wait around corners. Peering out from under bushes to fix him with its evil yellow eye. Maybe what he needs is a witch doctor, some serious voodoo. Plus a couple of hundred bucks so they could spend a night in a motel, with Charmaine beside him instead of out of reach in the back seat. That would be the bare minimum: to wish for any more would be pushing it.<br><br>Charmaine&#x2019;s commiseration makes it worse. She tries so hard. &#x201c;You are not a failure,&#x201d; she says. &#x201c;Just because we lost the house and we&#x2019;re sleeping in the car, and you got . . .&#x201d; She doesn&#x2019;t want to say fired. &#x201c;And you haven&#x2019;t given up, at least you&#x2019;re looking for a job. Those things like losing the house, and, and . . . those things have happened to a lot of people. To most people.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;But not to everyone,&#x201d; Stan would say. &#x201c;Not to fucking everyone.&#x201d;<br><br>Not to rich people.<br><br>---<br><br>They&#x2019;d started out so well. They both had jobs then. Charmaine was in the Ruby Slippers Retirement Homes and Clinics chain, doing entertainment and events--she had a special touch with the elderly, said the supervisors--and she was working her way up. He was doing well too: junior quality control at Dimple Robotics, testing the Empathy Module in the automated Customer Fulfillment models. People didn&#x2019;t just want their groceries bagged, he used to explain to Charmaine: they wanted a total shopping experience, and that included a smile. Smiles were hard; they could turn into grimaces or leers, but if you got a smile right, they&#x2019;d spend extra for it. Amazing to remember, now, what people would once spend extra for.<br><br>They&#x2019;d had a small wedding--just friends, since there wasn&#x2019;t much family left on either side, their parents being dead one way or another. Charmaine said she wouldn&#x2019;t have invited hers anyway, though she didn&#x2019;t elaborate because she didn&#x2019;t like to talk about them, but she wished her Grandma Win could have been there. Who knew where Conor was? Stan didn&#x2019;t look for him, because if he turned up he would probably have tried to grope Charmaine or do some other attention-grabbing stunt.<br><br>Then they had a beach honeymoon in Georgia. That was a high point. There are the two of them in the photos, golden and smiling, sunlight all over them like mist, raising their glasses of--what had that been, some tropical cocktail heavy on the lime cordial--raising their glasses to their new life. Charmaine in a retro flower-patterned halter top with a sarong skirt and a hibiscus blossom tucked behind her ear, her blond hair shining, ruffled by the breeze, him in a green shirt with penguins on it that Charmaine had picked out for him, and a panama; well, not a real panama, but that idea. They look so young, so untouched. So eager for the future.<br><br>Stan sent one of those photos to Conor to show that there was, finally, a girl of Stan&#x2019;s that Con couldn&#x2019;t poach; also as an example of the success Con himself might expect to have if he&#x2019;d settle down, go straight, stop doing minor time, quit fooling around on the fringes. It&#x2019;s not that Con wasn&#x2019;t smart: he was too smart. Always playing the angles.<br><br>Con sent a message back: Nice T&amp;A, big brother. Can she cook? Dumb penguins though. Typical: Con had to sneer, he had to disparage. That was before he&#x2019;d cut the lines, dumped his email, refused to share his address.<br><br>---<br><br>Back up north, they&#x2019;d made a down payment on a house, a starter two-bedroom in need of a little love but with room for the growing family, said the agent with a wink. It seemed affordable, but in retrospect the decision to buy was a mistake--there were the renovations and repairs, and that meant extra debt on top of the mortgage. They told themselves they could handle it: they weren&#x2019;t big spenders, they worked hard. That&#x2019;s the killer: the hard work. He&#x2019;d busted his ass. He might as well not have bothered, in view of the fuck-all he&#x2019;s been left with. It makes him cross-eyed to remember how hard he&#x2019;d worked.<br><br>Then everything went to ratshit. Overnight, it felt like. Not just in his own personal life: the whole card castle, the whole system fell to pieces, trillions of dollars wiped off the balance sheets like fog off a window. There were hordes of two-bit experts on TV pretending to explain why it had happened--demographics, loss of confidence, gigantic Ponzi schemes--but that was all guesswork bullshit. Someone had lied, someone had cheated, someone had shorted the market, someone had inflated the currency. Not enough jobs, too many people. Or not enough jobs for middle-of-the-road people like Stan and Charmaine. The northeast, which was where they were, was the hardest hit.<br><br>The Ruby Slippers branch where Charmaine worked ran into trouble: it was upscale, so a lot of families could no longer afford to park their old folks in there. Rooms emptied, overheads were cut. Charmaine applied for a transfer--the chain was still doing well on the West Coast--but that didn&#x2019;t happen, and she was made redundant. Then Dimple Robotics packed up and moved west, and Stan was out without a parachute.<br><br>They sat in their newly bought home on their newly bought sofa with the flowered throw pillows that Charmaine had taken such trouble to match, and hugged each other, and said they loved each other, and Charmaine cried, and Stan patted her and felt useless.<br><br>Charmaine got a temporary job waiting tables; when that place went belly up, she got another one. Then another, in a bar. Not high-end places; those were drying up, because anyone who could afford to eat fancy food was gobbling it farther west, or else in exotic countries where the concept of minimum wage had never existed.<br><br>No such luck for Stan, with the odd jobs: overqualified, was what they told him at the employment office. He said he wasn&#x2019;t picky--he&#x2019;d clean floors, he&#x2019;d mow lawns--and they smirked (what floors? what lawns?), and said they&#x2019;d keep him on file. But then the employment office itself closed down, because why keep it open if there was no employment?<br><br>---<br><br>They held on in their little house, living on fast food and the money from selling the furniture, skimping on energy use and sitting in the dark, hoping things would take an upturn. Finally they put the house on the market, but by then there were no buyers; the houses on either side of theirs were already empty, and the looters had been through them, ripping out anything that could be sold. One day they had no mortgage money left, and their credit cards were frozen. They walked out before they were thrown out, and drove away before the creditors could grab their car.<br><br>Luckily Charmaine had saved up a little stash of cash. That, and her tiny pay packet at the bar, plus tips--those have kept them in gas, and a post-office box so they can pretend to have an address if anything does come up for Stan, and the odd trip to the laundromat when they can&#x2019;t stand the griminess of their clothes.<br><br>Stan has sold his blood twice, though he didn&#x2019;t get much for it. &#x201c;You wouldn&#x2019;t believe it,&#x201d; the woman said to him as she handed him a paper cup of fake juice after his second blood drain, &#x201c;but some people have asked us if we want to buy their babies&#x2019; blood, can you imagine?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No shit,&#x201d; says Stan. &#x201c;Why? Babies don&#x2019;t have that much blood.&#x201d;<br><br>More valuable, was her answer. She said there was a news item that claimed a total blood renewal, young blood for old, staves off dementia and rolls your physical clock back twenty, thirty years. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s only been tried with mice,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Mice aren&#x2019;t people! But some folks will clutch at anything. We&#x2019;ve turned away at least a dozen baby-blood offers. We tell them we can&#x2019;t accept it.&#x201d;<br><br>Someone&#x2019;s accepting it, Stan thought. You can bet they are. If there&#x2019;s money in it.<br><br>---<br><br>If only the two of them could find some place where the prospects are better. There&#x2019;s said to be a boom in Oregon--fuelled by a rare earth discovery, China&#x2019;s buying a lot of that--but how can they get out there? They&#x2019;d no longer have Charmaine&#x2019;s trickle of money coming in, they&#x2019;d run out of gas. They could ditch the car, try hitching, but Charmaine is terrified by the thought. Their car is the only barrier between them and gang rape, and not just for her, she says, considering what&#x2019;s out there roaming around in the night with no pants on. She has a point.<br><br>What should he do to pull them out of this ditch? Whatever he has to. There used to be a lot of jobs licking ass in the corporate world, but those asses are now out of reach. Banking&#x2019;s left the region, manufacturing too; the digital genius outfits have migrated to fatter pastures in other, more prosperous locations and nations. Service industries used to be held out as a promise of salvation, but those jobs too are scarce, at least around here. One of Stan&#x2019;s uncles, dead now, had been a chef, back when cheffing was a good gig because the top slice was still living onshore and high-end restaurants were glamorous. But not today, when those kinds of customers are floating around on tax-free sea platforms just outside the offshore limit. People that rich take their own chefs with them. <br><br>---<br><br>Another midnight, another parking lot. It&#x2019;s the third one tonight; they&#x2019;ve had to flee the previous two. Now they&#x2019;re so on edge...</p><h2>Agatha Raisin and the Haunted House (Agatha Raisin Mysteries, No. 14)</h2><p>Just back from an extended stay in London, Agatha Raisin finds herself greeted by torrential rains and an old, familiar feeling of boredom. When her handsome new neighbor, Paul Chatterton, shows up on her doorstep, she tries her best to ignore his obvious charms, but his sparkling black eyes and the promise of adventure soon lure her into another investigation.<br><br>Paul has heard rumors about Agatha's reputation as the Cotswold village sleuth and wastes no time offering their services to the crotchety owner of a haunted house. Whispers, footsteps, and a cold white mist are plaguing Mrs. Witherspoon, but the police have failed to come up with any leads, supernatural or otherwise. The neighbors think it's all a desperate ploy for attention, but Paul and Agatha are sure something more devious is going on. Someone's playing tricks on Mrs. Witherspoon, and when she turns up dead under suspicious circumstances, Agatha finds herself caught up in another baffling murder mystery.<br></p><p><p><b>Things That Go Bump In The Night...</b><br>Agatha Raisin, snug and warm in her Carsley cottage, has that same old feeling-boredom-until a report of a haunted house sends her and new neighbor, handsome Paul Chatterton, to investigate. Suddenly, middle-aged Agatha is aglow with romance and excitement.</p><p>But the glow fades fast. It turns out Paul is a cad. The victim of the haunting is a universally disliked old biddy. And the ghost is most likely someone playing a dirty trick. Then an old lady is soon found murdered. But never fear! For Agatha, solving a homicide is more fun than hunting a ghost. She quickly has a theory and a risky scheme.

This is definitely a novel that rewards re-reading. When you read it again, you can pay more attention to the theme of country folk vs. city folk; the parallel marriage conflicts of the Cambers vs. the Trentons; the poignancy of the amiable St. Bernard (yes, the breed choice is just right) infected by a brain-destroying virus that makes it into a monster; and the way the "daylight burial" of the failed ad campaign is reflected in the sunlit Pinto that becomes a coffin. And how significant it is that this horror tale is <i>not</i> supernatural: it's as real as junk food, a failing marriage, a broken-down car, or a fatal virus.Stephen King, the world&#39;s bestselling novelist, was educated at the University of Maine at Orono.

Although detailed accounts of the fur-trade era have appeared, until recently the rich social history has been ignored. In this book, the fur trade is examined not simply as an economic activity but as a social and cultural complex that was to survive for nearly two centuries.</p><p>The author traces the development of a mutual dependency between Indian and European traders at the economic level that evolved into a significant cultural exchange as well. Marriages of fur traders to Indian women created bonds that helped advance trade relations. As a result of these "many tender ties," there emerged a unique society derived from both Indian and European culture.</p></p><p><p><strong>Sylvia Van Kirk </strong>is Associate Professor of Canadian History and Women?s Studies in the University of Toronto.

In that essay--reprinted here, with photographs of natural subjects by Nick Kelsh--Carson urged parents to take their children to wild places in order to introduce them to the astonishing variety of life that exists all around us: to study birds, listen to the winds, and observe the stars. Too much of the child's subsequent education, she warns, will be devoted to dimming that "clear-eyed vision, that true instinct for what is beautiful and awe-inspiring" with which children are born; it is the parent's task to be an adult guide who can in turn rediscover the "excitement and mystery of the world we live in." Carson's words are timely, and this beautifully illustrated edition makes a fine gift for new and prospective mothers and fathers. <i>--Gregory McNamee</i><p><strong>Rachel L. Carson </strong>(1907-1964) earned a graduate degree in zoology from Johns Hopkins in 1932, in an era when few women went to college. She was the first woman to pass the civil service exam and went on to work with the Fish and Wildlife Service, where she became chief editor of publications. Her gift for writing about technical science in clear, poetic prose eventually led to a full time writing career, culminating with her controversial <em>Silent Spring</em>, one of the most influential books of the century. She is often called the mother of the modern environmental movement. Two years after <em>Silent Spring</em> was published she died of cancer, possibly due to the very pesticides she warned against in her book.</p></p><h2>Casey Stengel: Baseball&#39;s Greatest Character</h2><p><b>The definitive biography of one of baseball's most enduring and influential characters, from <i>New York Times</i>&nbsp;bestselling author and baseball writer Marty Appel.<br><br></b>As a player, Charles Dillon "Casey" Stengel's contemporaries included Babe Ruth, Honus Wagner, and Christy Mathewson . . . and he was the only person in history to wear the uniforms of all four New York teams: the Dodgers, Giants, Yankees, and Mets. As a legendary manager, he formed indelible, complicated relationships with Yogi Berra, Joe DiMaggio, Mickey Mantle, and Billy Martin. For more than five glorious decades, Stengel was the undisputed, quirky, hilarious, and beloved face of baseball--and along the way he revolutionized the role of manager while winning a spectactular ten pennants and seven World Series Championships. &nbsp;<br><br>But for a man who spent so much of his life in the limelight--an astounding fifty-five years in professional baseball--Stengel remains an enigma. Acclaimed New York Yankees' historian and bestselling author Marty Appel digs into Casey Stengel's quirks and foibles, unearthing a tremendous trove of baseball stories, perspective, and history. Weaving in never-before-published family documents, Appel creates an intimate portrait of a private man who was elected into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1966 and named "Baseball's Greatest Character" by MLB Network's <i>Prime 9</i>. <i>Casey Stengel</i>&nbsp;is a biography that will be treasured by fans of our national pastime.</p><p>MARTY APPEL was the youngest public relations director in baseball history when George Steinbrenner elevated him to the New York Yankees post in 1973. &nbsp;He is the author or coauthor of numerous books, including the <i>New York Times </i>bestselling <i>Munson: The Life and Death of a Yankee Captain</i> and <i>Pinstripe Empire: The New York Yankees from Before the Babe to After the Boss</i>. He resides in New York City.1<br><br>Mail Call<br><br>It was time for the mail at the Stengel home.<br><br>Casey Stengel, now nearly eighty, loved this time of day. He would get up to three hundred letters every week, and since his home address&#x2014;ï¿½and phone number, of course&#x2014;ï¿½were listed in the phone book under &#x201c;Stengel, Charles Casey,&#x201d; it was not hard to know where to send a fan letter: 1663 Grandview Avenue, in Glendale, California. He and his wife, Edna, had lived there since her father built the place forty-ï¿½six years before, in 1924. People wanted his autograph, and he loved that they did.<br><br>Now, in 1970, in his retirement years, the home was a &#x201c;splendid&#x201d; place to be Casey Stengel. Old friends would visit, or new ones would just ring the bell, and he would regale them with stories, jumping with ease from Babe to Joe D to Yogi to Mickey to Marvelous Marv.<br><br>In his den, he would sit back in his ancient Yankee underwear (Edna was always on him to wear Mets underwear) and observe the world through six decades of baseball and worldly wisdom.<br><br>The home sat on a quiet two-ï¿½lane street in a fashionable neighborhood, near the homes of the USC baseball coach Rod Dedeaux and Babe Herman, his old Brooklyn Dodger teammate from the 1910s. Most people thought of Casey as either a Yankee or a Met, but of course he was a baseball lifer, who had played or managed almost everywhere and played with or against nearly everyone.<br><br>He batted against Grover Cleveland Alexander, chased fly balls hit by Babe Ruth, sent Ron Swoboda up to pinch hit, and moved Cleon Jones to left field. His career had spanned John McGraw and Tug McGraw.<br><br>Was there a ballpark he hadn&#x2019;t stood in? Never mind all those major-ï¿½league and minor-ï¿½league parks over more than half a century. For over fifty years, starting in 1910, the year of his first spring training, he had to check train schedules, road maps, and eventually flight schedules to get to his next training camp.<br><br>In 1910 and 1911, he traveled to Excelsior Springs, Missouri; then he went to Montgomery, Alabama (1912), Augusta, Georgia (1913&#x2013;ï¿½14), Daytona Beach, Florida (1915&#x2013;ï¿½16), Hot Springs, Arkansas (1917), Jacksonville, Florida (1918), Birmingham, Alabama (1920), Gainesville, Florida (1921), San Antonio, Texas (1922&#x2013;ï¿½23), Marlin, Texas (1923), St. Petersburg, Florida (1924&#x2013;ï¿½25), Jackson, Tennessee (1926&#x2013;ï¿½27), Biloxi, Mississippi (1928&#x2013;ï¿½29), Anniston, Alabama (1930), Miami, Florida (1931), Clearwater, Florida (1932), Miami (1933), Orlando, Florida (1934&#x2013;ï¿½35), Clearwater (1936), Bradenton, Florida (1938&#x2013;ï¿½40), San Antonio, Texas (1941), Sanford, Florida (1942), Wallingford, Connecticut (1943), Bartlesville, Oklahoma (1945), Boyes Hot Springs, California (1946&#x2013;ï¿½47), San Fernando, California, 1948), St. Petersburg (1949&#x2013;ï¿½50), Phoenix, Arizona (1951), and St. Petersburg (1952&#x2013;ï¿½60, 1962&#x2013;ï¿½65, and 1966&#x2013;ï¿½74 as a consultant).<br><br>And, of course, that excludes the road games and barnstorming games heading north that were part of spring training. One could learn a lot about people and a lot about America just by being Casey Stengel.<br><br>And his recall! Late in his life, some fan might come near the railing and say, &#x201c;Casey! Casey! My dad sold you a pair of shoes in Biloxi in 1928!&#x201d; Casey might rub his jaw and say, &#x201c;I was almost out the door and he sold me a pair of socks, too. He was a good salesman!&#x201d;<br><br>His home was not quite a mansion, nothing you would find in Bel Air, but it was grand in the upper-ï¿½middle-ï¿½class neighborhood in which it stood. Or &#x201c;splendid,&#x201d; as he loved to say about almost anything that got his approval. Its forty-ï¿½six hundred square feet (a bedroom and den were added in 1937 and 1956, respectively) sat on a lot that went back from the quiet street the length of a football field, with a swimming pool, a pool house, a tennis court, and an orchard. It was a two-ï¿½story Spanish-ï¿½architecture stucco dwelling, described in real-ï¿½estate terms as &#x201c;Spanish eclectic with a hipped roof.&#x201d; There were fourteen rooms, including five bedrooms, one living room with a barrel ceiling, two sitting rooms, maid&#x2019;s quarters, and five bathrooms, on one and a quarter acres.<br><br>&#x201c;Eclectic.&#x201d; That was a good word for a Casey Stengel residence. Edna had styled a room or two into Japanese traditional after making tours of the Far East. It was an odd fit with the Spanish architecture, but it worked.<br><br>Casey sat at a big desk in his den, surrounded by trophies and souvenirs, including the school bell from Central High School in Kansas City. He had always been a walking advertisement for Kansas City&#x2014;ï¿½his nickname came from &#x201c;K.C.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;To Charles (Casey-ï¿½Dutch) Stengel, dentist, athlete, manager, raconteur,&#x201d; said the inscription on the bell. &#x201c;For whom the bell tolled at Central High School, 1906&#x2013;ï¿½1910, from your many Kansas City friends.&#x201d;<br><br>There were autographed baseballs on shelves surrounding the room. Sometimes, if Edna was scolding him about something from another room, Casey might look up with those blue eyes and wink at his young assistant, Bobby Case. He&#x2019;d whisper, &#x201c;Whose name does she think is on the sweet spot of all these baseballs?&#x201d;<br><br>But he&#x2019;d say it for a laugh, because he loved Edna; theirs was one of the great love stories in baseball, a splendid marriage that lasted fifty-ï¿½one years, till his death. They had no children, which meant she did a lot of traveling with him. She lived the life of a baseball wife.<br><br>On this day, Bobby Case had the day&#x2019;s mail and was &#x201c;commencing&#x201d; (another Casey word) to sort it out by priority. Business letters took precedence over fan letters, but eventually he would get to all of them. He would sign most anything, and if someone just asked for his autograph, he had paper disks with a photo of his wrinkled face topped by a Mets cap. He would sign &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s Go Mets&#x2014;ï¿½Casey Stengel.&#x201d;<br><br>Bobby had been working as attendant in the visiting clubhouse for the Los Angeles Angels when they played at Chavez Ravine (which is what the Angels called Dodger Stadium). When the Angels prepared to move to Anaheim in 1966, Casey told him, &#x201c;You don&#x2019;t want to commute to Anaheim. Come work for me.&#x201d;<br><br>He had been lucky enough to be nabbed to be Casey&#x2019;s &#x201c;business manager,&#x201d; or assistant, which meant showing up each day to do whatever needed to be done. The mail was one of the few things that were part of a daily routine.<br><br>This particular day was early in 1970. Casey had been retired for five years from his last position, manager of the New York Mets. He would soon be off to St. Petersburg for another spring training, but these days he wasn&#x2019;t in uniform; he served as a vice-ï¿½president of the Mets, holding court, letting a new generation of sportswriters get to know him, and singing the praises of the &#x201c;amazin&#x2019; world champion Mets,&#x201d; who had stunned the nation with a miracle title in &#x2019;69.<br><br>Bobby handed Casey one unopened letter. It bore a familiar logo and return address: New York Yankees, Yankee Stadium, Bronx, New York 10451.<br><br>Casey took a puff of his Kent cigarette and proceeded to slice open the envelope with a letter opener.<br><br>It was from Bob Fishel, the Yankees&#x2019; public-ï¿½relations director, one of the few team employees who went back to his days with the team.<br><br>Fishel was writing to invite Casey to Old-ï¿½Timers&#x2019; Day that summer at Yankee Stadium.<br><br>Just as he had every year.<br><br>Bob had added in his own handwriting at the bottom, &#x201c;Really hope you and Edna can join us, Casey. The whole event would center on you, and we have plans to retire your uniform number as well.&#x201d;<br><br>Since that ugly day in October 1960 when Casey was told his &#x201c;services were no longer desired,&#x201d; he had never returned to Yankee Stadium, save for an exhibition game while managing the Mets or as a fan at a World Series game. A decade in exile.<br><br>He was still bitter, despite the logo on his boxer shorts. Ten pennants in twelve years, then fired after losing a seven-ï¿½game World Series? Because he had made the mistake of turning seventy?<br><br>The Yankees had just staged Mickey Mantle Day at the stadium in 1969, the year before. It was an enormous event, with over sixty thousand in attendance. Everyone of importance came back to honor Mantle and to see his number 7 formally retired. George Weiss, the general manager Mick hated, the man who had hired Casey and who was retired with Casey, came back. Mel Allen, the fired broadcaster who had given Mantle a bad medical reference, came back. Mick&#x2019;s minor-ï¿½league managers, his scout, and illustrious teammates (except for Roger Maris) came back. Casey Stengel did not. He loved Mantle like a son, but he would not go back, not even for this.<br><br>But something told him that it was time for a return. Bobby Case was surprised&#x2014;ï¿½he had expected to hear another &#x201c;no.&#x201d;<br><br>What was it? At seventy-ï¿½nine, was his boss growing sentimental? Was it the appeal from Fishel, whom he liked? Was it the realization that the team&#x2019;s ownership had changed and prolonged anger was pointless? Was it that, with the Mets reigning as world champions, he was getting satisfaction out of seeing the Yankees down?<br><br>Edna had entered the room by now. Casey told her about the invitation, and about the note from Fishel saying his number would be retired.<br><br>&#x201c;This is a big thing,&#x201d; he said to her. &#x201c;Having your number retired, that doesn&#x2019;t happen every day. I&#x2019;m thinking of going.&#x201d;<br><br>They always talked through big decisions. Edna remembered when Casey was managing Oakland in the Pacific Coast League in 1948 and the opportunity to manage the Yankees came up. They were so happy in Oakland. They needed a lot of discussion before finally saying yes&#x2014;ï¿½but maybe only for a year or two.<br><br>This wasn&#x2019;t going to be as important as that decision, but it did call for a conversation.

The Hon. Stephen Tennant, artist/writer, accomplished little professionally during his life (1906-1987) but his beauty and wit dominated his circle of productive companions: Cecil Beaton, E. M. Forster, the Sitwells, the Bloomsbury group, etc. Admirers from abroad as well (Greta Gardo, the young Truman Capote) visited Wilsford Manor, Tennant's country estate in Wiltshire; Willa Cather, despite her initial impressions of the flashy youth, became a loyal friend. A cold side of Tennant, however, is revealed in his cruel break with his lover, poet Siegfried Sassoon, who never recovered from the rejection. Hoare's extensive research is backed by excerpts from the subject's correspondence, interviews with survivors of the glittering age and striking photos, all heightening interest in a definitive Peter Pan. <br>Copyright 1990 Reed Business Information, Inc.Blessed with literary and artistic talents, friend to E.M. Forster, Virginia Woolf, and other prominent writers of his time, Tennant never acquired the self-discipline to achieve substantial success. Journalist Hoare suggests that this wealthy, flamboyantly effeminate British aristocrat may actually have been too insecure to risk failure. He was also self-destructive, as the account here of his stormy afair with Siegfried Sassoon demonstrates. Of equal interest are the author's discussions of Tennant's social milieu and the many artists and writers he knew. Extensive use of diaries, letters, and interviews gives this well-written, often moving account an undoubted authenticity.

Yet the challenge of writing such biographies is daunting even under the best of circumstances. The biographer must pursue a seemingly endless trail of published and unpublished sources, often in a variety of languages, exhaust the contents of numerous archives, winnow truth and fact from rumor and falsehood, strike the right balance between the public persona and the private person, and judge the wisdom and folly of the subject over the span of a lifetime. Such difficulties are multiplied when the subject of the biography is the leader of a closed society that jealously guards its secrets. This is certainly the case with Mao Zedong, the founder of modern China. But now, more than thirty-five years after his death in 1976, with the release of important new documents from China and exclusive access to major archives in the former Soviet Union, a clearer, more nuanced, more complete portrait of the most important Chinese leader in modern times can be drawn. That is the aim of this biography.<br> <br>To be sure, Mao has been the subject of numerous biographies in Western languages since the American journalist Edgar Snow first wrote down Mao&#x2019;s life story just past its midpoint, in July 1936. A year later Snow published that story as the centerpiece of Red Star Over China, an influential book that helped shape history and remains in print to this day. For what it tells about the lineage of Western-language Mao biographies&#x2014;a lineage from which our own biography significantly departs&#x2014;it is worth relating why that encounter between the guerrilla commander cum leader of the Chinese Communist Party and the young American reporter took place.<br> <br>Already a well-known journalist by the mid-1930s, Snow was extremely sympathetic to the Chinese communist movement, although he was not a Marxist. Among the mainstream media for which he wrote, including the New York Herald Tribune, Foreign Affairs, and the Saturday Evening Post, he enjoyed a reputation for being independent-minded, unlike many other leftist reporters in China, who openly paraded their pro-communist views.<br> <br>It was precisely this reputation that attracted the attention of the leaders of the Chinese Communist Party, including Mao Zedong. They intended to make use of the thirty-one-year-old American to improve their public image and expand their political influence. Snow had his own reasons for seeking out Mao. An ambitious journalist with an instinct for the big story, he jumped at the opportunity for a sensational scoop. Each man intended to use the other for his own purposes. Snow arrived in Baoan, in northern Shaanxi province, on July 13, 1936, just two days after Mao Zedong himself set up camp in that remote and desolate town. Mao was fleeing from Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek, head of the National Government and the leader of the Nationalist Party (the Guomindang, or GMD), whose forces had inflicted a serious defeat on the Chinese Red Army.<br> <br>Mao granted Snow&#x2019;s request for a series of interviews, in which he first spoke at length about his childhood and youth before outlining his career as a communist revolutionary. The communists had made a shrewd choice picking Snow. The impressionable American came to view Mao as a wise philosopher-king, Lincolnesque in appearance, perspicacious, easygoing, and self-confident. &#x201c;He certainly believed in his own star and destiny to rule,&#x201d; Snow recalled.1 Transcribing Mao&#x2019;s monologue into his notebook during long nights in the candlelit cave where they met, Snow was sooner Mao&#x2019;s amanuensis than a critical journalist. Once his mission was accomplished, Snow returned to Beijing with his precious notes and began working on the manuscript that became Red Star Over China.<br> <br>Just as Mao and Snow had hoped, Red Star Over China created a sensation, particularly among liberal intellectuals and leftists in the West. Its intimate portrayal of Mao as a romantic revolutionary struck a sympathetic chord with Western readers disillusioned with the austere figure of an increasingly authoritarian Chiang Kai-shek. Snow&#x2019;s pioneering work set the tone for many subsequent books by authors who were equally or even more sympathetic in their depictions of Mao. There was only one major point on which these later works differed from Snow&#x2019;s. While Snow viewed Mao as a faithful follower of Soviet Marxism, other writers asserted that as early as the late 1930s, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) under Mao&#x2019;s leadership had become autonomous and self-reliant. According to this view, Mao, an independent thinker and actor, had basically distanced himself from Moscow, unlike the dogmatic Chinese Stalinists whom he had bested in intraparty struggles. Mao stood tall; he was his own man, an authentic Chinese revolutionary, not Stalin&#x2019;s stooge. This was Mao&#x2019;s main attraction for authors trying to explain the Chinese revolution to American readers.<br> <br>As early as the late 1940s and early 1950s, leading American China scholars including John King Fairbank, Benjamin I. Schwartz, Conrad Brandt, and Robert North propounded what became the classical formulation about Mao&#x2019;s &#x201c;independence,&#x201d; both with respect to his relations with Stalin and his views of China.2 They wrote that Stalin mistrusted Mao and considered him a &#x201c;peasant nationalist&#x201d; rather than a communist. Furthermore, the upsurge of the Chinese revolution in the countryside under the leadership of Mao seemed to disprove the orthodox Marxist view regarding the &#x201c;historic role&#x201d; of the working class. China&#x2019;s &#x201c;peasant revolution&#x201d; was the opening act in what promised to be a dramatic era of peasant revolutions throughout the postcolonial world. After the split between the Soviet and Chinese communist parties in the early 1960s, Russian and Chinese authors followed a similar line.<br> <br>Meanwhile, Mao underwent a permutation from down-to-earth revolutionary commander into what one biographer in the early 1960s called the &#x201c;emperor of the blue ants,&#x201d; in reference to the blue clothing all Chinese wore.3 After proclaiming the establishment of the People&#x2019;s Republic of China (PRC) on October 1, 1949, Mao moved into the Forbidden City in Beijing, the former imperial quarters. As the cult of his personality developed in the following years, he became inaccessible except to his close colleagues and members of his entourage. His public appearances were carefully stage-managed and his interviews and pronouncements assumed an increasingly Delphic character. The Western-language biographies of Mao published during his lifetime, including the best one, by the prominent China scholar Stuart R. Schram in 1967,4 were constructed largely on the basis of published Communist Party documents; Mao&#x2019;s published writings, speeches, and statements; impressions of foreigners who had been granted audiences with Mao; a few memoirs by political acquaintances and adversaries; and a variety of other scattered sources. The thesis of Mao&#x2019;s independence and creative adaptation of Marxism to Chinese circumstances continued to occupy center stage.<br> <br>At first glance, this thesis seems well-founded. Until the end of 1949, Mao never visited Moscow even once, and Stalin did not know him personally. At the same time, negative reports calling Mao &#x201c;anti-Leninist&#x201d; and accusing him of the cardinal sin of &#x201c;Trotskyism&#x201d; regularly reached the Kremlin from various sources of information inside and outside the Chinese Communist Party. Thus Khrushchev&#x2019;s assertion that Stalin considered Mao a &#x201c;cave Marxist&#x201d; appears logical.5 In the late 1950s, after the Twentieth Congress of the Soviet Communist Party condemned Stalinism, Mao himself often recalled that he sensed Stalin&#x2019;s mistrust of him.6<br> <br>On closer inspection, however, the received wisdom regarding Mao&#x2019;s relationship to Stalin and the Soviet Union turns out to be wrong. In reality, as newly available Soviet and Chinese archives reveal, Mao was a faithful follower of Stalin who took pains to reassure the Boss of his loyalty and who dared to deviate from the Soviet model only after Stalin&#x2019;s death.<br> <br>This revelation is one of many reasons why a thorough reassessment of Mao is warranted. The truth has long reposed in the secret archives of the CCP, the Soviet Communist Party, and the Communist International (Comintern). Only recently have these archives become available, in whole or in part. The most interesting of innumerable revelations regarding Mao&#x2019;s policies, outlook, and personal life are contained in unpublished documents regarding Mao, his enemies, and his friends, preserved in the former Central Party Archive of the Central Committee of the Soviet Communist Party in Moscow. The Bolsheviks began to organize the archive shortly after the October Revolution of 1917. From the very beginning its main task was to collect documents not only on the history of the Bolshevik party, but also on the history of the international labor and communist movements. After the liquidation of the Comintern in 1943, all of its documentary collections were transferred to the Central Party Archive. In the 1950s the archives of the Communist Information Bureau (Cominform) were also deposited there. Finally, in June 1999, the former Communist Youth League Archives were merged into the collection. Today these consolidated archives are known as the Russian State Archive of Social and Political History. A brief survey of the contents of these archives highlights their importance as a source of new information that we have thoroughly mined for this biography of Mao Zedong.<br> <br>First, they are the biggest depository of documents in the world on the international communist movement and the history of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU). They house about two million written documents, 12,105 photographic materials, and 195 documentary films, which are organized in 669 thematic collections. A core component of the archives is an extensive collection of papers related to the Chinese communist movement. These include voluminous files of the CCP delegation to the Executive Committee of the Comintern (ECCI); the CCP Central Committee&#x2019;s various accounts and financial receipts; the Comintern and the Bolshevik party&#x2019;s directives to China; the papers of Lenin, Stalin, Trotsky, and other Bolshevik leaders; secret reports of Chinese communist and Chinese nationalist representatives to the Comintern; and personal dossiers on many leading Chinese revolutionaries.<br> <br>The collection of private documents relating to the Chinese communists is of particular interest. Unlike many other archival materials, these were not opened to most scholars even during the brief period of the Yeltsin ideological &#x201c;thaw&#x201d; in the early 1990s. This collection has always been secured in a top-secret section of the archives. Even today public access to the files is highly restricted. Only a very few specialists, including one of us, Alexander V. Pantsov, have been permitted access to these materials and continue to enjoy such access on the basis of personal ties with archivists and scholars in contemporary Russia. This restricted collection comprises 3,328 personal dossiers, including those of Mao Zedong, Liu Shaoqi, Zhou Enlai, Zhu De, Deng Xiaoping, Wang Ming, and many other top members of the CCP leadership.<br> <br>The dossier on Mao Zedong is the most impressive. It contains fifteen volumes of unique papers, including his political reports; private correspondence; stenographic records of meetings between Mao and Stalin, Stalin and Zhou Enlai, and Mao and Khrushchev; Mao&#x2019;s medical records, compiled by his Soviet physicians; secret accounts by KGB and Comintern agents; personal materials regarding Mao&#x2019;s wives and children, including the birth certificate of his previously unknown ninth child, born in Moscow; accusations against Mao written by his political enemies within the CCP leadership; and a variety of Soviet embassy and KGB secret messages related to the political situation in the PRC from the late 1950s to the early 1970s. We are the first biographers of Mao to make use of all these materials&#x2014;materials that proved invaluable in reassessing Mao&#x2019;s private and political life.<br> <br>Supplementing the Russian and Chinese archival sources is a large volume of biographical material, reminiscences, and handbooks published in recent years in the PRC. Among them are memoirs and diaries of Mao&#x2019;s secretaries, paramours, relatives, and acquaintances that are also helpful in our reinterpretation of Mao&#x2019;s life.<br> <br>No less important are documents from the still highly restricted collections of the Central Committee of the CCP in Beijing, recently made known through the efforts of Chinese historians. These archival materials include a thirteen-volume set of Mao Zedong&#x2019;s manuscripts, starting from the founding of the PRC; a seven-volume chronicle of the Mao clan based in Shaoshan; records of Mao&#x2019;s private talks; and various collections of Mao&#x2019;s previously unknown draft papers, speeches, comments, critiques, notes, and poetry.<br> <br>Our biography of Mao Zedong is based upon all of these unique archives and newly available documents as well as many interviews with people who knew Mao. As such it is up-to-date. A recent biography of Mao by Jung Chang and Jon Halliday, Mao: The Unknown Story, was criticized in the academic community on the grounds of unreliability and distorted judgments.7 We tried to avoid these shortcomings by making careful and discriminating use of a wider array of sources than any other biographer, weighing evidence carefully, and presenting sound and forceful judgments unmarred by political considerations. This attitude allows us to present the Great Helmsman as the multifaceted figure that he was&#x2014;a revolutionary and a tyrant, a poet and a despot, a philosopher and a politician, a husband and a philanderer, a successful creator and ultimately an evil destroyer. We show that Mao was neither a saint nor a demon, but rather a complicated figure who indeed tried his best to bring about prosperity and gain international respect for his country. Yet he made numerous errors, having trapped himself in a cul-de-sac of a political and ideological utopia, and basking in his cult of personality while surrounding himself with sycophantic courtiers. Without a doubt he was one of the greatest utopians of the twentieth century, but unlike Lenin and Stalin, he was not only a political adventurer but also a national revolutionary. Not only did he promote radical economic and social reforms, but he also brought about a national revolution in former semicolonial China and he united mainland China, which had been engulfed in a civil war. Thus it was Mao who renewed the world&#x2019;s respect for China and the Chinese people, who had long been despised by the developed Western world and Japan. Yet his domestic policies produced national tragedies that cost the lives of tens of millions of Chinese.<br> <br>We also tried to write a lively and interesting human story that devotes a lot of attention to Mao&#x2019;s character and his personal and family life as well as to his political and military leadership. It is filled with fascinating stories from memoirs and interviews that present Mao as son, husband, father, friend, and lover, as well as strategist, theorist, statesman, and political infighter. From many angles we show Mao as a man of complex moods, subject to bouts of deep depression as well as flights of manic exaltation, a man of great force of will and ambition who achieved virtually unlimited power during his leadership ...</p><h2>Is This All There Is To Life?: Finding Wisdom for Life in Ecclesiastes</h2><p>Since the days of Solomon, men and women have wondered, &#39;Is this all life is about?&#39; &#39;Is it just a mindless pursuit after things that never satisfy?&#39; Ray Stedman guides readers through the book of Ecclesiastes to demonstrate that contentment and joy are gifts from God.

But he's ignored the sparks between them because he's so shy. So Simon's little brother, Isaac, takes matters into his own hands. He's determined to give his brother the best Christmas present ever&#x2014;a date with his favorite teacher.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Amish novelist Byler brings her tender humor and skillful observation of family relationships to this holiday story. "I love Isaac's self-confidence and scheming as he prods his reluctant older brother," she smiles knowingly about the characters she's created.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Byler takes her reader straight into the Amish world as Isaac is both charmed and annoyed by his too talkative, but quite bright, Mam. He can barely tolerate his little nieces and nephews, who substantially outnumber the grown-ups when the whole family gets together. And he loves his humble circumspect Dat, although he isn't always pleased by how well Isaac sweeps the forebay in the barn. As anticipation for the Christmas program at the schoolhouse builds, Isaac cares for troubled Ruthie who stutters miserably when she practices her poem. And he wonders how much he'll have to help his brother Sim act on his growing affection for Teacher Catherine!<br><br>Skyhorse Publishing, as well as our Arcade, Yucca, and Good Books imprints, are proud to publish a broad range of books for readers interested in fiction&#x2014;novels, novellas, political and medical thrillers, comedy, satire, historical fiction, romance, erotic and love stories, mystery, classic literature, folklore and mythology, literary classics including Shakespeare, Dumas, Wilde, Cather, and much more.

She is the author of five bestselling fiction series, all set in the Amish world: Hester Takes Charge, Lancaster Burning, Sadie&#x2019;s Montana, Lizzie Searches for Love, and The Dakota Series. In addition, Byler has written five Christmas romances: <i>The Little Amish Matchmaker</i>, <i>The Christmas Visitor</i>, <i>Mary&#x2019;s Christmas Good-Bye</i>, <i>Becky Meets Her Match</i>, <i>A Dog for Christmas</i>, and <i>A Horse for Elsie</i>. Linda is also well known within the Amish community as a columnist for a weekly Amish newspaper.Renowned Amish romance-novelist Byler has deviated from her traditional trilogies to provide readers with a morsel of holiday goodness. Narrator Isaac Stoltzfus is a seventh-grader at the schoolhouse in his Amish community. Like most adolescents, Isaac thinks adults make the world too complicated. This especially applies to his older brother, Simon, who can&#x2019;t muster up the courage to ask Isaac&#x2019;s pretty teacher, Catherine, on a date. Despite preoccupation with chores and helping a friend overcome her anxiety about the impending school Christmas program, Isaac finds time to plot an encounter between Simon and Catherine. As Christmas draws closer and Simon still hasn&#x2019;t acted, Isaac finds himself hoping for a miracle. The true charm of the novel lies in the tension an adult reader can detect between Isaac&#x2019;s self-assured narration and the reality of the world around him, which is often different than he assumes. Byler&#x2019;s tactile evocation of Amish life, and Isaac&#x2019;s innocent yet revealing ponderings about tradition versus modernity, will satisfy any reader interested in the nuances of Amish culture and emotionally rich love stories. --Amber Peckham</p><h2>Everything Counts</h2><p><p>For generations, people all over the world have been touched by the godly insights of Oswald Chambers.

He was more of a minister than he ever knew. 01.01 what&#39;s your point? I eagerly expect and hope that I will in no way be ashamed, but will have sufficient courage so that now as always Christ will be exalted in my body, whether by life or by death. [Philippians 1:20] IT all starts here. Before you can go any further you have to understand this one main point. Ready? From this point on EVERYTHING COUNTS. Everything you do, do as a servant of God. Everywhere you go, go with God at your side. Every person you meet, greet them as a child of God. You have to be willing to give the whole sha-bang of your being to this journey, or else you&#39;re just reading words. Got that? The one thing you have that no one can ever take away from you is you. No one can ever take it---but you can give it away. That&#39;s hard. But once you give all that you are to God, you will begin an adventure like nothing you&#39;ve ever experienced. OZ says: An overweening consideration for ourselves is the thing that keeps us from that decision, though we put it that we are considering others. When we consider what it will cost others if we obey the call of Jesus, we tell God He does not know what our obedience will mean. Keep to the point; He does know. Shut out every other consideration and keep yourself before God for this one thing only---My Utmost for His Highest. I am determined to be absolutely and entirely for Him and for Him alone. JUST BETWEEN YOU AND GOD When you pray ask God to use all of you---all your talents, all your mind, all your heart. Physically. Emotionally. Mentally. Ask God to use all of you so that no part of your mind, body, and soul will go unused. Ask---and then listen. GOD FIRST. GOD LAST. GOD IN ALL THINGS. GOD IN ALL WAYS. CAN YOU HANDLE THAT? OKAY THEN, LET&#39;S GO. 01.02 road trip Abraham...obeyed and went, even though he did not know where he was going. [Hebrews 11:8 ] TOSS the map. It won&#39;t do you any good on this journey. Journey? This is more like an adventure. Pack light &#39;cause you don&#39;t know what you&#39;ll need. You are venturing out on the 100 percent grace of God. You don&#39;t get to know where until you get there. You don&#39;t know what you&#39;re going to see until you see it. Is that a scary way to travel? For some, yes. For others, it&#39;s the only way. On this particular road trip it&#39;s essential. OZ says: Each morning you wake it is to be a &#39;going out,&#39; building in confidence on God...Have you been asking God what He is going to do? He will never tell you. God does not tell you what He is going to do; He reveals to you Who He is. Do you believe in a miracle-working God, and will you go out in surrender to Him until you are not surprised an atom at anything He does? Suppose God is the God you know Him to be when you are nearest to Him---what an impertinence worry is! Let the attitude of the life be a continual going out in dependence upon God, and your life will have an ineffable charm about it, which is a satisfaction to Jesus. You have to learn to go out of convictions, out of creeds, out of experiences, until so far as your faith is concerned, there is nothing between yourself and God. JUST BETWEEN YOU AND GOD When you close this book---say a prayer and give something to God. Start small. Simply hand over one thing that&#39;s been on your mind for a while. Give it to God, then stop stressing about it. It&#39;s in God&#39;s hands. He may not solve it for you right away. He may show you how to solve it on your own. But it&#39;s God&#39;s now. Let him help you with it. CLOSE YOUR EYES. TAKE YOUR HANDS OFF THE WHEEL . YOU AIN&#39; T IN CHARGE THIS T IME, SPARKY. 01.03 the thunder rolls Clouds and thick darkness surround him... [Psalm 97:2] THESE are more than just words. Jesus was more than just a really nice guy who told nice stories about nice things. There comes a point where the words become real, and then the very real sense of just who this man was settles into our minds. It&#39;s like a storm that&#39;s out there someplace and we are just beginning to hear the thunder or smell the wind. We come up with all sorts of ways to deal with our understanding of Jesus. We paint pictures and write songs. We create wonderful visuals of Jesus standing with his arm around our shoulder. Jesus as our friend is only the beginning. There&#39;s so much more. The sheer awesomeness is a light so bright it could knock us to the ground. (That actually happened to a few people in the Bible.) OZ says: The only possibility of understanding the teaching of Jesus is by the light of the Spirit of God on the inside. If we have never had the experience of taking our commonplace religious shoes off our commonplace religious feet, and getting rid of all the undue familiarity with which we approach God, it is questionable whether we have ever stood in His presence. The people who are flippant and familiar are those who have never yet been introduced to Jesus Christ. After the amazing delight and liberty of realizing what Jesus Christ does, comes the impenetrable darkness of realizing Who He is. JUST BETWEEN YOU AND GOD Offer a prayer. Maybe you can even get on your knees for this one. See him as more than a buddy. He is your only God. Did you create a universe; put the stars in place; dig out the space for the oceans and mold the mountains? When you close this book and pray, remember that you are praying to the one who did all these things. THIS IS DEEPER THAN YOU THINK. THIS IS ALL FAR FROM OVER. YOU MAY BE IN OVER YOUR HEAD. DO YOU WANT TO GET WET?</p><h2>The Gospel in Solentiname (English and Spanish Edition)</h2><p>Available for the first time in one volume, a classic commentary on the gospels in the spirit of liberation theology. <br><br>For many years, the peasants in Solentiname, a remote archipelago in Lake Nicaragua, gathered each Sunday to reflect on the gospel reading.

When the tide receded, a section of the city's North End had been transformed into a war zone. The Great Boston Molasses Flood claimed the lives of twenty-one people and scores of animals, injured 150, and caused widespread destruction.<br><br>But the molasses flood was more than an isolated event. Its story overlays America's story during a tumultuous decade in our history. Tracing the era from the tank's construction in 1915 through the multiyear lawsuit that followed the tragedy, <i>Dark Tide</i> uses the drama of the flood to examine the sweeping changes brought about by World War I, Prohibition, the Anarchist movement, the Red Scare, immigration, and the role of big business in society.</p><p>Stephen Puleo is author of the critically acclaimed Boston-area bestseller Dark Tide: The Great Boston Molasses Flood of 1919. A former award-winning newspaper reporter and contributor to American History magazine, he holds a master&#39;s degree in history and wrote his thesis on Italian immigration and the settlement of Boston&#39;s North End. He donates a portion of his book proceeds to the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation (JDRF), the leading charitable funder and advocate of juvenile (Type 1) diabetes research. Stephen and his wife, Kate, live in the Boston area.In this volume, Puleo, a contributor to American History magazine, sets out to determine whether the collapse of a molasses tank that sent a tidal wave of 2.3 million gallons of the sticky liquid through Boston's North End and killed 21 people was the work of Italian anarchists or due to negligence by the tank's owner, United States Industrial Alcohol. Getting into the minds of the major players in the disaster-USIA suits, victims, witnesses, North End residents, politicians-he re-creates not only the scene but also the social, political and economic environments of the time that made the disaster more than just an industrial accident. While the collapse's aftermath is tragic, the story itself is not exactly gripping. More interesting are the tidbits of Boston's and America's history, such as the importance of molasses to all U.S. war efforts up to and including WWI, which Puleo uses to put the tank collapse in the context of a very complex time in U.S. history. The most striking aspect of this tale is the timeliness of the topics it touches on. Describing Americans being persecuted because of their ethnicity, a sagging economy boosted by war, and terrorism on U.S. soil that results in anti-immigration laws and deportations, Puleo could just as easily be writing about current events as about events in 1919. Overall, this is another piece in the jigsaw puzzle that is Boston's long and rich history.

Winnicott's distinctive contribution to our understanding of human development, based on extensive clinical work with babies and young children, is known and valued the world over.<br>In <em>Playing and Reality</em> he is concerned with the springs of imaginative living and of cultural experience in every sense, with whatever determines an individual's capacity to live creatively and to find life worth living. The ideas expressed here extend the theme first put forward in his paper 'Transitional Objects and Transitional Phenomena' published in 1953. They relate to an area of experience that has for centuries been a recurrent preoccupation of philosophers and poets. This intermediate area, between internal and external reality, is intensely personal, since its existence depends, as does the use that can be made of it, on each individual's early life experiences. If children can utilize this realm to initiate their relationship with the world, first through transitional objects, and later through play and shared playing, then cultural life and enjoyment of the cultural heritage, will be open to them.</p><p>D.W.

He bought a Sears Roebuck guitar at the age of 13 and several months later played his first &#34;gig.&#34; (He recalled playing until his fingers were raw!) Mel took up the tenor banjo shortly thereafter and continued to play both instruments. During his teenage years Mel played with a wild assortement of bands and characters in rural Missouri. Perhaps no &#34;gig&#34; was as strange as the job he landed with, in Mel&#39;s words, &#34;a snake oil salesman.&#34; This flamboyant peddler would pull his ostentatious Pierce Arrow automobile, complete with steer horns mounted on the grill, into the center of a small, rural town. Mel would sit on the car and play up a storm on the tenor banjo. After a crowd gathered, the peddler took over and began extolling the merits of his &#34;wonder elixer.&#34; In 1933 Mel Bay moved to St. Louis and began his professional career. He played with numerous local and traveling bands. In addition, he landed staff guitar jobs on several radio stations. Mel fronted his own trio (piano, bass, guitar) and played steadily for 25 years! He was equally adept on most fretted instruments and played mandolin, uke, Hawaiian guitar, tenor and plectrum banjo professionally. While Mel was actively pursuing his playing career, he continued to teach as many as 100 students a week. He decided to begin writing instructional materials due to the difficulty encountered by guitarists at playing good sounding chord forms in rhythm sections and due to the poor note reading ability prevalent among guitarists. After the war Mel was asked to write instructional materials on guitar for GI&#39;s wanting to learn music under the GI Bill. In 1947 Mel formed his own publishing company and wrote his landmark initial book titled The Orchestral Chord System for Guitar. (This book is still in print under the title Rhythm Guitar Chord System and continues to be one the finest rhythm guitar chord texts available!) His Modern Guitar Method was penned shortly thereafter. For years Mel traveled from town to town talking to guitar teachers and players and showing them his publications. At one time Mel claims to have known virtually every guitar teacher in America on a first name basis! The guitar and Mel Bay books caught on in a big way in the 1950&#39;s. Things have continued to grow ever since. Mel used to sell D&#39;Angelico guitars. At any given time he would have 5 or 6 &#34;lying around the house.&#34; Mel played professionally on his New Yorker model but his favorite was the initial Mel Bay Model crafted as a gift for him by John D&#39;Angelico. This famous guitar had all of the main features of the New Yorker but was a &#34;cut away&#34; model and had a slightly thinner neck. This instrument has been pictured on the Mel Bay Modern Guitar Method for decades. Someone once calculated that sales of guitar books written by Mel Bay have exceeded 25 million copies.

Craft , winner of more than 100 graphic arts awards, has illustrated a number of books for children, including The Adventures of Tom Thumb and Cinderella . She lives in Norfolk, Connecticut.So perfect are the Pre-Raphaelite details and gestures that it's easy to imagine Kinuko Craft's (Adventures of Tom Thumb) paintings hanging in a gallery. Her husband Mahlon Craft's enhanced version of Sleeping Beauty affords wide scope for the artist's romanticism. In a new episode at the outset, for example, the queen meets a frog that predicts the birth of her daughter; in the facing art, the queen, dressed in a diaphanous white gown, languidly loosens her hair ribbon, while the frog, brought forward by cunning attention to light and detail, waits to speak to her. The backdrop is a dark forest, and the effect is properly otherworldly. Farther on, when the king and queen discover the evil fairy's handiwork, the good fairy comes to ease their grief; Craft portrays the fairy descending from gilded clouds, driving a chariot drawn by dragons. The fairies are transparent, like spirits; the evil fairy is a gothic horror in black draperies. Aurora is ethereally lovely, the landscapes magnificent and the palace splendid. Families aiming to assemble a library of classic fairy tales may well settle on this as the definitive Sleeping Beauty.

For seventeen-year-old Stacy Black, it all begins with the smashing of a window. After putting her fist through the glass, she checks into a mental hospital. Stacy hates it there but despite herself slowly realizes she has to face the reasons for her depression to stop from self-destructing. Based on the author's experiences, <i>How I Made it to Eighteen</i> is a frank portrait of what it's like to struggle with self-esteem, body image issues, drug addiction, and anxiety. </p><p><i>How I Made It to Eighteen</i> is a 2011 Bank Street - Best Children's Book of the Year.</p></p><p><p>Tracy White (www.traced.com) began publishing her work online in 1996.

Ostensibly Stacy works toward her goal of being happy again, earning privileges at the hospital and even becoming close friends with another patient. But she moves both forward and backward in her recovery, clinging to an unhealthy relationship with Eric, offering advice she cannot take, and refusing to be open and honest about her thoughts and actions. <br>"Stacy&#x2019;s story of anxiety, abuse, self-harm, addiction, and depression, is also a story of an interesting, creative young woman and her friends, a veritable chorus that adds perspective and insight into Stacy&#x2019;s struggles. White&#x2019;s images are as intense and telling as the written text. Comparisons to Susanna Kaysen&#x2019;s Girl, Interrupted (Random House, 1993) are unavoidable: both are stories of self-discovery, memoirs of the female authors' time in mental health facilities during their late adolescence. Both Kaysen&#x2019;s and White&#x2019;s stories are fascinating and frustrating. Most significantly, both memoirs stop short of offering easy solutions to complicated problems. White&#x2019;s perspective is honest, often unflinchingly and quite unsympathetic to her adolescent self. Still it is made clear why Stacy is likeable and loyal. More honest than Cut (Front Street, 2000/VOYA February 2001), more intriguing even than Girl, Interrupted, White&#x2019;s novel uses stark black-and-white imagery to construct her frank and honest story of a fraught adolescence.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>VOYA</i></p><p>&#x201c;Tracy White's "mostly true" graphic novel,<i> How I Made It to Eighteen</i> (Roaring Brook, 2010), begins when the 17-year-old narrator checks herself into Golden Meadows Hospital after smashing a glass window with her fist. Struggling with depression, exhaustion, and drug addiction, Stacy Black just wants to feel like herself again ("I just don't know who 'me' is anymore"). Described with stark candor, her recovery is heart-wrenching and hard-won, as she wrestles with issues of self-esteem and body image, hangs on to an unhealthy relationship with her boyfriend, and refuses to admit to anyone&#x2013;even herself&#x2013;that she has an eating disorder. Meanwhile, her interactions with the other patients reveal her to be a caring, encouraging, and creative individual, and her desire to get better is both earnest and inspiring. White's artwork is as unflinchingly honest as her narrative, and the graphic-novel format keeps the pacing slow and deliberate, allowing the emotional content to truly sink in. Interview-style commentary from four of Stacy's friends appears throughout, rounding out the main character and illustrating that these girls struggle with many of the same issues. Words and pictures work flawlessly together to paint an unsentimental, poignant, and telling picture of an arduous experience, revealing that while there are no easy answers, there's a whole lot to work toward and hope for.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>School Library Journal</i></p></p><h2>The Design and Creation of Jewelry, 3rd Edition</h2><p>An illustrated guide to the techniques and materials used by the present-day jewelry craftsman</p><p></p><h2>Messages From Your Angels: What Your Angels Want you to Know</h2><p>This card deck makes it even easier than ever to give an amazingly accurate angel reading for yourself or others.

There is, for instance, a good deal of pleasure to be had out of professor and past-prodigy Grady Tripp&#39;s awful life, as portrayed by Michael Chabon in WONDER BOYS. There is a certain amount of slapstick here, but it&#39;s balanced by Chabon&#39;s superb portrait of a gale-force mid-life crisis, a soul-destroying albatross of an unfinished novel and the mind-numbing inconsequence of writers&#39; conferences.

I spent thirty years not knowing what boundaries were and another ten learning to set them. I gave until I was depleted and needed someone to take care of me. I threatened, begged, hinted, and manipulated to get what I wanted. I was convinced that I knew what was best for other people. I got so busy teaching them their lessons that I forgot to learn mine.</p><p>Within minutes of meeting a man, I was sure I'd met my soul mate. A few hours later, I'd fantasize about the wedding. That's how it happened on television. Isn't that how it happened in life? I'd spend two years trying to get into a relationship, and the next five trapped, clawing my way out. I obsessed until my head ached. Literally, it hurt. I didn't know what feelings were. Whenever I said I felt something, people said, "Don't feel that!"</p><p>Like millions of other women and men, I was victimized as a child. Instead of holding the perpetrators responsible, I blamed myself. <i>There's something wrong with me,</i> I thought. I didn't see the bad things that happened to me happening to anyone else. Feeling like we caused the problem is a legitimate stage of grief. Feeling ashamed is normal when we've been abused. Blaming ourselves is a survival skill. It helps us feel in control when life doesn't make sense and being abused doesn't make any sense at all.</p><p>Besides, aren't women supposed to suffer? We sacrifice ourselves. I became a martyr. I thought taking care of other people was my job. If I took care of them, I hoped they'd return the favor and take care of me. But that didn't happen. People expected me to take care of them once I started that pattern. There were many reasons I didn't take care of myself. The word <i>no</i> wasn't in my vocabulary. Good people were selfless. Loving myself was out of the question. Selfish! But the biggest reason I didn't take care of myself is that I didn't know how to.</p><p>Many of us didn't (or don't) know about self-care. It wasn't written about in books or talked about in school. We get user manuals for simple products, but we don't get a handbook for life. We stumble through complex situations, figuring things out for ourselves. Controlling and taking care of others -- the entire package of codependent behaviors -- become survival tools, living skills that we think will keep us safe. Then one day these behaviors turn on us. Our relationships and lives stop working and we don't know why. By then these survival behaviors are habits. They're all we know how to do.</p><p>If I had the years back I spent worrying about how the things I couldn't control were going to turn out, I'd have a third of my life to live over. That would be a life in which I wouldn't feel responsible for everyone or feel guilty all the time. I wouldn't waste energy controlling, enabling, and obsessively rescuing people -- the "helpful" things codependents do that don't really help. I'd let people take care of their responsibilities and I'd take care of mine. I wouldn't let people hurt me. I'd set boundaries -- say <i>no</i>. I wouldn't do only what other people wanted me to do; I'd do what I wanted, too. This time my giving would come from my heart, and my helping would actually help. I wouldn't judge everything that happened as wrong, including what I did, said, thought, and felt. I'd let life unfold, people be who they are, and I'd let myself be me. This time, I'd have the courage to experience true love.</p><p>I'd trust my intuition. If something didn't feel right, I'd know it probably wasn't. If I felt sad, I'd cry. If I felt angry, I'd feel that. I wouldn't ignore emotions until I imploded in illness or exploded in rage. I'd get out of my head and into my heart. I'd deal with my and others' feelings without all the drama; as much as possible I'd handle uncomfortable situations with diplomacy and tact. I wouldn't feel obligated and trapped. I'd know I had choices -- whether that means choosing attitude, gratitude, meditation, or prayer. Instead of protecting myself with fierce independence, I'd ask for help. I wouldn't be controlled by people and external events. My control center would be where it belongs -- in me. I wouldn't let other people's approval determine whether or not I approved of myself. I'd be energized by nature, God, and Life. I wouldn't drain other people, and I wouldn't let them drain me so much that my battery would die.</p><p>My relationships would be equal ones. I'd share power instead of one of us controlling and the other being controlled. I wouldn't have to create chaos to feel alive; I'd know I'm real. As one friend reminds me, instead of running headfirst into trouble, I'd go around it whenever I could (without resorting to denial). I know the value of peace. I'd create beauty, be of service, and have fun. I'd live and love at the same time. I'd admit my mistakes. But I'd also appreciate what I did well and let myself enjoy success.</p><p>This time I'd know what it means to love and take care of myself.</p><p>2 ï¿½ How to Use This Handbook</p><p>To prepare for writing this handbook, I reread books I wrote years ago: <i>Codependent No More</i> (1985-86), <i>Beyond Codependency</i> (1988-89), <i>The Language of Letting Go</i> (1990), and <i>The Codependents' Guide to the Twelve Steps</i> (1990). I was surprised by how much I have changed. I barely recognized who I am now compared to who I was back then.</p><p>When I first wrote about codependency, I couldn't get theword past my computer's spell-checker. Most of the world didn't recognize the word yet either. For a book originally rejected by twenty publishers ("Nice idea," they said, "but there aren't enough codependents to make publishing the manuscript worthwhile"), <i>Codependent No More</i> -- strictly by word of mouth -- became a best-seller. It hit the lists and is still a backlist best-seller. My Beverly Hills internist read it as part of his medical training. It's part of many school and college curriculums. Therapists recommend it to patients. Thousands of people give it to family and friends. It's read in treatment centers, recovery groups, and by people around the world searching for how to make the pain from self-neglect stop. The subject of codependency and how to recover from it struck a universal nerve.</p><p>Naming that pain was like discovering fire -- a fire that people still discover each month as thousands begin the journey we started back then.</p><p>"We're part of a groundswell movement that's come into its own time," I wrote in <i>Beyond Codependency</i>. "Media and public attention may subside. But recovery from codependency is more than a fad. We started the journey of self-care and self-love. We're not stopping now."</p><p>Those words were prophetic. Concepts such as letting go, detachment, setting boundaries, and self-care mainstreamed. They worked their way into the culture. Ideas previously unknown or talked about only by small groups of recovering people are now discussed almost anywhere, from coffee shops to TV. Ideas that originated with the codependency recovery movement are now how millions of people -- whether or not they're in recovery -- live.</p><p>Four of the fourteen books I've written are devoted to codependency I didn't think I'd ever say this, but those four aren't enough. I'm writing this book to clarify confusion, discuss new information, write about how codependency has mutated, address new support options, and remind us about what we learned.</p><p>Although I've changed significantly since writing <i>Codependent No More</i>, I still step in codependent puddles. I might get hooked into someone's stuff, let their problems control me, over-engage, or start reacting instead of taking right action. I'll let family conditioning affect me, neglect to set boundaries, or shut down emotionally. There are times I have to slam on the brakes, STOP, and remember to take care of myself. I don't sink in quicksand like I used to, but sometimes I revert to survival mode. That's yesterday's news.</p><p>I don't call that <i>relapsing</i>. Caring about people we love, feeling victimized when we're betrayed, giving our all to people we love, or wanting to control people because we're watching them destroy themselves and hurt us doesn't mean we're sick. These are natural reactions. Codependency is about normal behaviors taken too far. It's about crossing lines.</p><p>This book is written for beginners and those further down the taking-care-of-themselves road. It offers practical help for people recovering from chemical dependency when they bottom out from codependency, usually after being sober anywhere from seven to ten years. The seven-year mark for recovering alcoholics and addicts is a widely accepted but unofficial recovery rule of thumb. After people stop drinking, they discover there are many things other than alcohol and drugs that they can't control, a rite of passage that could be dubbed "the Second Great Surrender." We let go of all illusions of control.</p><p>I also wrote this book for people who want to learn more about behaviors such as setting boundaries or dealing with feelings, but who don't want or need to go to treatment, therapy, or attend recovery groups. You don't have to label yourself codependent and embark on a grand transformation to benefit from this book.

But the writer possessed another side, one which is delightfully exposed in this hilariously charming memoir of her family's life in rural Vermont. Fans of <b>Please Don't Eat the Daisies</b>, <b>Cheaper by the Dozen</b>, and anything Erma Bombeck ever wrote will find much to recognize in Shirley Jackson's home and neighborhood: children who won't behave, cars that won't start, furnaces that break down, a pugnacious corner bully, household help that never stays, and a patient, capable husband who remains lovingly oblivious to the many thousands of things mothers and wives accomplish every single day.<p>"Our house," writes Jackson, "is old, noisy, and full. When we moved into it we had two children and about five thousand books; I expect that when we finally overflow and move out again we will have perhaps twenty children and easily half a million books." Jackson's literary talents are in evidence everywhere, as is her trenchant, unsentimental wit. Yet there is no mistaking the happiness and love in these pages, which are crowded with the raucous voices of an extraordinary family living a wonderfully ordinary life.</p><p>Continuously in print since 1948, Jackson's <b>Haunting of Hill House</b> has been bought by Dreamworks.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p></p><p>Can this be the author of such chilling tales as <i>The Lottery</i> and <i>The Haunting of Hill House</i>? An ordinary housewife stuck in a big, shabby house with three marvelous, demanding children and a charming husband who takes detached interest in the chaos they generate? Yes, it's Shirley Jackson all right: the precision of her observations and prose is familiar, even if her humor is something of a surprise. Not until Anne Lamott's <i>Operating Instructions</i> in 1993 would another woman write with such honesty about the maddening multitude of trivial, essential chores that constitute a mother's life. But Jackson nailed it first, 40 years earlier, in her hilarious chronicle of life in a small Vermont town, where getting the kids to school on time requires the combined gifts of a drill sergeant and a lady's maid. The saga of her son's bumpy adjustment to kindergarten, frequently anthologized as <i>Charles</i>, is justly famous, but Jackson's account of the Department Store Trip from Hell (two kids, two toy guns, one doll carriage and doll, mayhem in revolving doors and escalators) is even funnier. Although her memoirs are as merciless as her ghost stories, you may not notice because you're laughing so hard. <i>--Wendy Smith</i>Shirley Jackson (1919&#x2013;1965), a celebrated writer of horror, wrote many stories as well as six novels and two works of nonfiction.</p><h2>The Berenstain Bear Scouts and the Sci-fi Pizza (Berenstain Bear Scouts)</h2><p>When the evil Weasel McGreed cooks up a flying secret weapon that would silence them once and for all, the Bear Scouts are challenged to out-race a monstrous pizza or become trapped in a gooey mess.

Soviets kept files on all foreigners, studied their patterns, and tapped their phones. Intelligence work was effectively impossible. The Soviet threat loomed larger than ever.<br><i>The Moscow Rules</i> tells the story of the intelligence breakthroughs that turned the odds in America's favor. As experts in disguise, Antonio and Jonna were instrumental in developing a series of tactics--Hollywood-inspired identity swaps, ingenious evasion techniques, and an armory of James Bond-style gadgets--that allowed CIA officers to outmaneuver the KGB.<br>As Russia again rises in opposition to America, this remarkable story is a tribute to those who risked everything for their country, and to the ingenuity that allowed them to succeed.</p><p><b>Antonio (Tony) Mendez</b> served in the CIA for twenty-five years and is a highly decorated CIA officer, one of the top fifty officers in its first fifty years. He received the Intelligence Star for Valor for the ARGO operation, the story of which was told in the 2013 movie of the same name. He is the author of the New York Times bestselling <i>Argo, The Master of Disguise</i>, and <i>Spy Dust</i>.<br><br><b>Jonna Mendez</b> is a former Chief of Disguise with over twenty-five years of experience as a CIA officer working in Moscow and other sensitive areas. She participated in a number of training exercises, along with Tony, which ultimately led to the codification of the rules.

Usually, she appreciated the agency&#x2019;s thoroughness.&nbsp; Today, all she could think about was her four-month- old baby, and the promise Faith had made to her mother that she would be back no later than noon.<br><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The clock on the dash read ten after one o&#x2019;clock when she started the car.&nbsp; Faith mumbled a curse as she pulled out of the parking lot in front of the Panthersville Road headquarters.&nbsp; She used Bluetooth to dial her mother&#x2019;s number.&nbsp; The car speakers gave back a static-y silence.&nbsp; Faith hung up and dialed again.&nbsp; This time, she got a busy signal.&nbsp; <br> Faith tapped her finger on the steering wheel as she listened to the bleating.&nbsp; Her mother had voicemail.&nbsp; <i>Everybody</i> had voicemail.&nbsp; Faith couldn&#x2019;t remember the last time she&#x2019;d heard a busy signal on the telephone.&nbsp; She had almost forgotten the sound.&nbsp; There was probably a crossed wire somewhere at the phone company.&nbsp; She hung up and tried the number a third time.&nbsp; <br> Still busy.<br><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Faith steered with one hand as she checked her Blackberry for an email from her mother.&nbsp; Before Evelyn Mitchell retired, she had been a cop for just shy of four decades.&nbsp; You could say a lot about the Atlanta force, but you couldn&#x2019;t claim they were behind the times.&nbsp; Evelyn had carried a cell phone back when they were more like purses you strapped around your shoulder.&nbsp; She&#x2019;d learned how to use email before her daughter had.&nbsp; She&#x2019;d carried a Blackberry BlackBerry&nbsp; for almost fifteen years.<br><br> But, she hadn&#x2019;t sent a message today.&nbsp; <br><br> Faith checked her cell phone voicemail.&nbsp; She had a saved message from her dentist&#x2019;s office about making an appointment to get her teeth cleaned, but there was nothing new.&nbsp; She tried her phone at home, thinking maybe her mother had gone there to pick up something for the baby.&nbsp; Faith&#x2019;s house was just down the road from Evelyn&#x2019;s.&nbsp; Maybe Emma had run out of diapers.&nbsp; Maybe she&#x2019;d needed another bottle.&nbsp; Faith listened to the phone ring at her house, then heard her own voice answer, telling callers to leave a message.<br><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She ended the call.&nbsp; Without thinking, she glanced into the back seat.&nbsp; Emma&#x2019;s empty car seat was there.&nbsp; She could see the pink liner sticking out over the top of the plastic.&nbsp; <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Idiot,&#x201d; Faith whispered to herself.&nbsp; She dialed her mother&#x2019;s cell phone number.&nbsp; She held her breath as she counted through three rings.&nbsp; Evelyn&#x2019;s voicemail picked up.<br><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Faith had to clear her throat before she could speak.&nbsp; She was aware of a tremor in her tone.&nbsp; &#x201c;Mom, I&#x2019;m on my way home.&nbsp; I guess you took Em for a walk ...&#x201d;&nbsp; . . .&#x201d;&nbsp; Faith looked up at the sky as she merged onto the interstate. &nbsp;She was about twenty minutes outside of Atlanta and could see fluffy white clouds draped like scarves around the skinny necks of skyscrapers.&nbsp; &#x201c;Just call me,&#x201d; Faith said, worry needling the edge of her brain.<br><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Grocery store.&nbsp; Gas station.&nbsp; Pharmacy.&nbsp; Her mother had a car seat identical to the one in the back of Faith&#x2019;s car.&nbsp; She was probably out running errands.&nbsp; Faith was over an hour late.&nbsp; Evelyn would&#x2019;ve taken the baby and ...&nbsp; . . .&nbsp; Left Faith a message that she was going to be out.&nbsp; The woman had been on call for the majority of her adult life.&nbsp; She didn&#x2019;t go to the toilet without letting someone know.&nbsp; Faith and her older brother, Zeke, had joked about it when they were kids.&nbsp; They always knew where their mother was, even when they didn&#x2019;t want to.&nbsp; Especially when they didn&#x2019;t want to.<br><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Faith stared at the phone in her hand as if it could tell her what was going on.&nbsp; She was aware that she might be letting herself get worked up over nothing.&nbsp; The landline could be out.&nbsp; Her mother wouldn&#x2019;t know this unless she tried to make a call.&nbsp;&nbsp; Her cell phone could be switched off or charging or both.&nbsp;&nbsp; Her Blackberry BlackBerry could be in her car or her purse or somewhere she couldn&#x2019;t hear the tell-telltale vibration.&nbsp; Faith glanced back and forth between the road and her Blackberry BlackBerry as she typed an email to her mother.&nbsp; She spoke the words aloud as she typed&#x2014;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;On-my-way.&nbsp; Sorry-I&#x2019;m-late.&nbsp; Call-me.&#x201d;<br><br> She sent the email, then tossed the phone onto the seat along with the spilled items from her purse.&nbsp; After a moment&#x2019;s hesitation, Faith popped the gum into her mouth.&nbsp; She chewed as she drove, ignoring the purse lint clinging to her tongue.&nbsp; She turned on the radio, then snapped it back off.&nbsp; The traffic thinned as she got closer to the city.&nbsp; The clouds moved apart, sending down bright rays of sunshine.&nbsp; The inside of the car began to bake. <br><br> Ten minutes out, Faith&#x2019;s nerves were still one edge, and she was sweating from the heat in the car.&nbsp; She cracked the sunroof to let in some air.&nbsp; This was probably a simple case of separation anxiety.&nbsp; She&#x2019;d been back at work for a little over two months, but still, every morning when Faith left Emma at her mother&#x2019;s, she felt something akin to a seizure take hold.&nbsp; Her vision blurred.&nbsp; Her heart shook in her chest.&nbsp; Her head buzzed as if a million bees had flown into her ears.&nbsp; She was more irritable than usual at work, especially with her partner, Will Trent, who either had the patience of Job or was setting up a believable alibi for when he finally snapped and strangled her.<br><br> Faith couldn&#x2019;t recall if she had felt this same anxiety with Jeremy, her son, who was now a freshman in college.&nbsp; Faith had been eighteen when she entered the police academy.&nbsp; Jeremy was three years old by then.&nbsp; She had grabbed onto the idea of joining the force as if it was the only life preserver left on the <i>Titanic</i>.&nbsp; Thanks to two minutes of poor judgment in the back of a movie theater and what foreshadowed a lifetime of breathtakingly bad taste in men, Faith had gone straight from puberty to motherhood without any of the usual stops in between.&nbsp; At eighteen, she had relished the idea of earning a steady paycheck so that she could move out of her parents&#x2019; house and raise Jeremy the way that she wanted.&nbsp; Going to work every day had been a step toward independence.&nbsp; Leaving him during the day had seemed like a small price to pay.<br><br> Now that Faith was thirty-four, with a mortgage, a car payment, and another baby to raise on her own, she wanted nothing more than to move back into her mother&#x2019;s house so that Evelyn could take care of everything.&nbsp; She wanted to open the refrigerator and see food that she didn&#x2019;t have to buy.&nbsp; She wanted to turn on the air conditioner in the summer without worrying about having to pay the bill.&nbsp; She wanted to sleep until noon, and then watch TV all day.&nbsp; Hell, while she was at it, she might as well resurrect her father, who&#x2019;d died eleven years ago, so that he could make her pancakes at breakfast and tell her how pretty she was.<br><br> No chance of that now.&nbsp; Evelyn seemed happy to play the role of nanny in her retirement, but Faith was under no illusion that her life was going to get any easier.&nbsp; Her own retirement was almost twenty years away.&nbsp; The Mini had another three years of payments and would be out of warranty well before that.&nbsp; Emma would expect food and clothing for at least the next eighteen years, if not more.&nbsp; And it wasn&#x2019;t like when Jeremy was a baby and Faith could dress him in mismatched socks and yard sale hand-me-downs.&nbsp;

Well, not everything I know, because a lot of what I know, you know. But everything I know about poetry. All my tips and tricks and woes and worries are going to come tumbling out before you. I&#x2019;m going to divulge them. What a juicy word that is, &#x201c;divulge.&#x201d; Truth opening its petals. Truth smells like Chinese food and sweat.<br> <br>What is poetry? Poetry is prose in slow motion. Now, that isn&#x2019;t true of rhymed poems. It&#x2019;s not true of Sir Walter Scott. It&#x2019;s not true of Longfellow, or Tennyson, or Swinburne, or Yeats. Rhymed poems are different. But the kind of free-verse poems that most poets write now&#x2014;the kind that I write&#x2014;is slow-motion prose.<br> <br>My life is a lie. My career is a joke. I&#x2019;m a study in failure. Obviously I&#x2019;m up in the barn again&#x2014;which sounds like a country song, except for the word &#x201c;obviously.&#x201d; I wonder how often the word &#x201c;obviously&#x201d; has been used in a country song. Probably not much, but I don&#x2019;t know because I hardly listen to country, although some of the folk music I like has a strong country tincture. Check out Slaid Cleaves, who lives in Texas now but grew up right near where I live.<br> <br>So I&#x2019;M UP in the second floor of the barn, where it&#x2019;s very empty, and I&#x2019;m sitting in what&#x2019;s known as a shaft of light. The light leans in from a high window. I want to adjust my seat so I can slant my face totally into the light. Just ease it into the light. That&#x2019;s it. If this barn were a prison cell, this would be the moment of the day that I would look forward to. Sitting here in the long womanly arm of light, the arm that reaches down like Anne Boleyn&#x2019;s arm reaching down from her spot-lit height. Not Anne Boleyn. Who am I thinking of? Margot Fonteyn, the ballet dancer. I knew there was a Y in there.<br> <br>There&#x2019;s one droopy-bottomed wasp diving back and forth, having some fun with what&#x2019;s available. I can move my head a certain way, and I feel the sun warming up the clear flamingos that swim around in my eyeballs. My corneas are making infinity symbols under their orange-flavored lids.<br> <br>I can even do eyelid wars. Do you do that? Where you try as hard as you can to look up with your eyeballs, rolling them back in your head, but with your eyes closed. Your eyelids will keep pulling your eyes back down because of the inter-lock between the two sets of muscles. Try it. It&#x2019;s a good way of passing the time.<br> <br>Don&#x2019;t chirp at me, ye birdies! I&#x2019;ve had enough of that kind of chirpage. It cuts no grease with me.<br> <br>WHEN I COME across a scrap of poetry I like, I make up a tune for it. I&#x2019;ve been doing this a lot lately. For instance, here&#x2019;s a stanza by Sir Walter Scott. I&#x2019;ll sing it for you. &#x201c;We heard you in our twilight caves&#x2014;&#x201d; Try it again.<br><br>It&#x2019;s written in what&#x2019;s called a ballad stanza. Four lines, four beats in each line, and the third line drives toward the fourth. Notes of joy can <i>pierce</i> the waves, Sir Walter says. In other words, notes of joy can cut through the mufflement. Notes of joy have a special STP solvent in them that dissolves all the gluey engine deposits of heartache. War and woe don&#x2019;t have anything like the range and reach that notes of joy do.<br> <br>And yes, of course, there are things that should be said about iambic pentameter, and I don&#x2019;t want to lose sight of that. I don&#x2019;t want to slight &#x201c;the longer line.&#x201d; I hope we can get to that fairly soon. My theory&#x2014;I can&#x2019;t resist giving you a little glimpse of it here&#x2014;my theory is that iambic pentameter is in actuality a waltz. It&#x2019;s not five-beat rhythm, even though &#x201c;pent&#x201d; means five, because five beats would be totally offkilter and ridiculous and would never work and would be a complete disaster and totally unlistenable. Pentameter, so called, if you listen to it with an open ear, is a slow kind of gently swaying three-beat minuetto. Really, I mean it.<br> <br>And what romanticism did was to set the pentameter minuet aside and try to recover the older, more basic ballad rhythm. Somewhere along the way, so the Romantic poets felt, the humanness and the singingness and the amblingness of lyric poetry became entangled in frippery and parasols, and that&#x2019;s because we stopped hearing those four basic pacing beats. That&#x2019;s what Walter Scott was bringing back when he published his border ballads, and what Coleridge was bringing back when he wrote the Kubla Khan song and &#x201c;The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.&#x201d; They were bringing back the ballad. &#x201c;Where Alph, the sacred river ran&#x201d;&#x2014;four beats. &#x201c;Through caverns measureless to man&#x201d;&#x2014;four beats. And it&#x2019;s the basis of song lyrics, too, because lyric poetry <i>is</i> song lyrics, that&#x2019;s why it&#x2019;s called lyric poetry.<br> <br>And you know? I&#x2019;ve read too many difficult poems. I&#x2019;ve postponed comprehension too many times. And I&#x2019;ve written difficult poems, too. No more.<br> <br>YOU&#x2019;RE OUT THERE. I&#x2019;m out here. I&#x2019;m sitting in the sandy driveway on my white plastic chair. There&#x2019;s a man somewhere in Europe who is accumulating a little flotsam heap of knowledge about the white plastic chair. He calls it the &#x201c;monobloc&#x201d; chair. A word I&#x2019;ve never used. Monobloc, no K. And I&#x2019;m sitting in one. Its arms are blindingly white in the sun.<br> <br>His name is Jens Thiel. God, I love Europeans. Jens. Especially the ones from smaller countries. Holland, Denmark, Sweden, Belgium. I love those places. And of course: Amsterdam. What a great name for a city. Paul Oakenfold has a piece of trance music called &#x201c;Amsterdam.&#x201d; His name is Paul, and my name is Paul. Paul: What is that crazy U doing there? Paw&#x2014;U&#x2014;L.<br> <br>A woman is walking by on the street. Ah, it&#x2019;s Nanette, my neighbor. I knew it was her. She&#x2019;s carrying a garbage bag. She&#x2019;s picking up trash, I guess. Nan does that. She has an early-morning stroll sometimes, and I&#x2019;ve noticed she takes along an empty trash bag tucked into her back pocket. I&#x2019;m going to wave to her. Hi! Hello! She waved back.<br> <br>Yes, she&#x2019;s picking up a beer can and shaking it out, and now she&#x2019;s putting it in that trash bag. The beer can is faded to a pale violet color. I think I can almost hear the soft rustle of the bag as things fall into it. Pfft. Pfft. Sometimes maybe a clink.<br> <br>Nan is or soon will be divorced from her husband, Tom&#x2014; Tom, who every weekend went windsurfing in a blue-armed wetsuit. She has a son named Raymond, a good kid who plays lacrosse. And she now evidently has a new boyfriend, a curly-haired man named Chuck, annoyingly handsome.<br> <br>OF COURSE YOU already understand meter. When you hear it, you understand it, you just don&#x2019;t know you understand it. You, as a casual reader of poems, and as a casual listener to pop songs, understand meter better than the metrists who misdescribed it over several centuries understood it. Even they understood it better than they knew.<br> <br>My neighbor Nan seems to be fully committed to her new flame, Chuck. His car is in the driveway again. I suppose that&#x2019;s a good thing. She deserves to be happy with a good-looking man like Chuck.<br> <br>Roz, the woman who lived with me in this house for eight years, has moved away.<br> <br>My dog is shedding because it&#x2019;s summer, and then the birds, that keep chirping and chirping, make nests of the dog hair. It&#x2019;s good for that.<br> <br>I wish I could smoke pot. What would that do? I don&#x2019;t even know where I would get pot around here. Somebody said the wispy dude with the pointy sideburns who works at the pet-food store. Could I maybe offer some to Roz, as a dramatic gesture? I&#x2019;ve never bought pot in my life. Maybe it&#x2019;s time. No, I don&#x2019;t think it is. Too involved. But I think I will step in from the driveway for a moment to get a clear glass bottle of Newcastle Brown Ale. I do love a palate cleanser of pure Newcastle Brown.<br> <br>Roz is kind of short. I&#x2019;ve always been attracted to short women. They&#x2019;re usually smarter and more interesting than tall women and yet people don&#x2019;t take them as seriously. And it&#x2019;s a bosomy kind of generous smartness, often. But she&#x2019;s moved out, so I should stop talking about her.<br> <br>I&#x2019;m a little sick of all the bird chirping, frankly. They just don&#x2019;t stop. I mowed the lawn yesterday so I wouldn&#x2019;t have to hear their racket. &#x201c;Chirtle chirtle.&#x201d; It&#x2019;s constant. And as soon as I started mowing I knew this was the best thing I could be doing. Walking behind this armful of noise, going around, turning the corner I&#x2019;d already turned, circumventing the overturned canoe. I ducked under the clothesline that Roz strung last year between the barn and the box elder tree. The white rope is now a lovely dry gray color. She used to hang many beautiful tablecloths and dishtowels on that clothesline. I should use it myself, instead of the dryer, which is making a thumping noise anyway, and then if she drove by she&#x2019;d see that I was being a responsible person who dried my clothes in the sun. I wish I&#x2019;d taken a picture of that clothesline with her faded shirts on it. No bras that I remember, but you can&#x2019;t expect bras necessarily on a clothesline. You have to go to Target to see bras hanging nobly out for the public gaze.<br> <br>I got in bed last night and I closed my eyes and I lay there and then a powerful urge came over me to cross my eyes. I thought of tragic people like Don Rickles, Red Skelton, people like that. Broken professional entertainers who maybe once had been funny. And now they were in Vegas, on cruise control, using their eye-crossing to allude to their early period of genuine funniness. Or they were dead.<br> <br>So I crossed my eyes with my eyes closed. And I saw something in the dark: two crescent moons on the outside of my vision, which were the new moons of strain. I could feel my corneal pleasure domes moving, too. And as my eyes reached maximum crossing I felt an interesting blind pain of wrongness. I decided that I should hold on to that.<br> <br>SO NOW, you&#x2019;re waiting. I&#x2019;ve promised something. You&#x2019;re thinking okay, he&#x2019;s said he&#x2019;s going to divulge. Your hope is that I, Paul Chowder, have some things that I know that you don&#x2019;t know because I have been a published poet for a while. And maybe I do know a few things.<br> <br>One useful tip I can pass on is: Copy poems out. Absolutely top priority. Memorize them if you want to, but the main thing is to copy them out. Get a notebook and a ballpoint pen and copy them out. You will be shocked by how much this helps you. You will see immediate results in your very next poem, I promise.<br> <br>Another tip is: If you have something to say, say it. Don&#x2019;t save it up. Don&#x2019;t think to yourself, I&#x2019;m going to build up to the truth I really want to say. Don&#x2019;t think, In this poem, I&#x2019;m going to be sneaky and start with this other truth over here, and then I&#x2019;m going to scamper around a little bit over here, and then play with some purple Sculpey over here in the corner, and finally I&#x2019;ll reach the truth at the very end. No, slam it in immediately. It won&#x2019;t work if you hold it in reserve. Begin by saying what you actually care about saying, and the saying of it will guide you to the next line, and the next, and the next. If you need to arrange things differently later, you can do that.<br> <br>And never think, Oh, heck, I&#x2019;ll write that whole poem later. Never think, First I&#x2019;ll write this poem about my old orange life jacket, so that I&#x2019;ll be more ready to confront the more haunting, daunting reality of this poem here about the treehouse that was rejected by its tree. No. If you do, the bigger theme will rebel and go sour on you. It&#x2019;ll hang there like a forgotten chili pepper on the stem. Put it down, work on it, finish it. If you don&#x2019;t get on it now, somebody else will do something similar, and when you crack open next year&#x2019;s <i>Best American Poetry</i> and see it under somebody else&#x2019;s name you&#x2019;ll hate yourself.<br> <br>Another tip: The term &#x201c;iambic pentameter&#x201d; isn&#x2019;t good. It isn&#x2019;t at all good. It&#x2019;s the source of much grief and muddle and some very bad enjambments. Louise Bogan once said that somebody&#x2019;s enjambments gave her the willies, and she&#x2019;s right, they can do that to you. You shudder, reading them. Most iambic-pentameter enjambments are a mistake. That sounds technical but I&#x2019;m talking about something real&#x2014; a real problem.<br> <br>And finally, the really important thing you have to know is: The four-beat line is the soul of English poetry.<br> <br>PEOPLE ARE GOING to feed you all kinds of oyster crackers about iambic pentameter. They&#x2019;re going to say, Oh ho ho, iambic pentameter! The centrality of the five-stress line! Because &#x201c;pent&#x201d; is five in Babylonian, and five is the number of fingers on your hand, and five is the number of slices of American cheese you can eat in one sitting. They&#x2019;re going to talk to you about Chaucer and about blank verse&#x2014;which is another confusing term&#x2014;and all this so-called prosody they&#x2019;re going to shovel at you. And sure&#x2014;fine&#x2014;you can handle it. You&#x2019;re up to whatever mind-forged shrivelments they&#x2019;re going to dish out that day. But just remember (a) that the word &#x201c;prosody&#x201d; isn&#x2019;t an appealing word, and (b) that pentameter came <i>later on.</i> Pentameter is secondary. Pentameter is an import from France. And French is a whole different language. The real basis of English poetry is this walking rhythm right here.<br> <br>Woops&#x2014;dropped my Sharpie.<br> <br>Right here: One&#x2014;two&#x2014;three&#x2014;four. &#x201c;Plumpskin, Ploshkin, Pelican jill. We think so then, we thought so still.&#x201d; I think that was the very first poem I heard, &#x201c;The Pelican Chorus,&#x201d; by Edward Lear. My mom read it to me. God, it was beautiful. Still is. Those singing pelicans. They slapped their feet around on those long bare islands of yellow sand, and they swapped their verb tenses so that then was still and still was then. They were the first to give me the shudder, the shiver, the grieving joy of true poetry&#x2014;the feeling that something wasn&#x2019;t right, but it was all right that it wasn&#x2019;t right. In fact it was better than if it had been right.<br> <br>In the middle of the night<br> <br>Miss Clavel turns on the light<br> <br>Hear that? Another four-beat line. My mother read that one to me, too. And &#x201c;Johnny Crow&#x2019;s Garden.&#x201d; And A. A. Milne and his snail and his brick. Milne was a metrical genius. And Dr. Seuss, of course, the great Ted Geisel. Who probably was, if I really want to be truthful and honest&#x2014;and I do, of course&#x2014;the poet most important to me until I was about twelve. You remember the little intense guy with the hat on, who&#x2019;s on his stool in the Plexiglas dome, counting the people all over the world who are going to sleep?<br> <br>And it scans. &#x201c;Two Biffer-Baum birds are now building their nest.&#x201d; It rhymes&#x2014;it relies a fair amount on silly proper names, but it rhymes&#x2014;and it scans perfectly. Dr. Seuss was a stickler for scansion. He was part of a lineage that runs back through <i>Punch</i> and Lear and Gilbert and Sullivan and Lewis Carroll and Barham&#x2019;s <i>Ingoldsby Legends.</i> He uses the four-beat line in the great old way. In fact, I&#x2019;d say almost all the poems that I heard as a child were classic four-beat lines.<br> <br>Hell, let&#x2019;s get into it. Where&#x2019;s my Sharpie again? Okay:<br><br>See those four numbers? Those are the four beats. Four stresses, as we say in the meter business. Tetrameter. Four. &#x201c;Tetra&#x201d; is four. Like Tetris, that computer game where the squares come down relentlessly and overwhelm your mind with their crude geometry and make you peck at the arrow keys like some mindless experimental chicken and hurry and panic and finally you turn your computer off. And you sit there thinking, Why have I just spent an hour watching squares drop down a computer screen?<br> <br>And his <b>aunt</b> Jo<b>bis</b>ka <b>made</b> him <b>drink</b><br> <b>La</b>vender <b>wa</b>ter <b>tinged</b> with <b>pink</b>.<br> <br>That&#x2019;s Lear again. Hear it? You can&#x2019;t help but hear it. Four beats in ea...</p><h2>Paradise Lost</h2><p>This epic is Milton&#39;s most famous work, employing the heterodox theology later expounded in De Doctrina Christiana.</p><p></p><h2>The Alternative Answer: The Nontraditional Investments That Drive the World&#39;s Best-Performing Portfolios</h2><p><p><em>The Alternative Answer</em> by Bob Rice is the first book to explain the new world of alternative investing strategies, showing how to use these new products for inflation-protected income, risk-adjusted growth, and long-term wealth transfer.</p><p>The Yale Endowment keeps only 6% of its investments in US stocks, but its portfolio has produced a 100% gain over the past decade. Indeed, the world&#x2019;s elite investors have long relied on <em>alternative investments</em> to produce their superior returns. Until now those options were the exclusive purview of institutions and the super wealthy, but today any informed investor can play the same game.</p><p>A rainbow of investment options such as timber, startups, MLPs, hedged strategies, managed futures, infrastructure, cat bonds, peer-to-peer lending, farmland, and dozens of other non-traditional strategies can provide dramatically better gains, with less total risk, than the standard choices. In <em>The Alternative Answer</em>, Bob Rice, Bloomberg TV&#x2019;s Alternative Investment Editor, leads an entertaining and easy-to-understand tour of this world, and suggests specific alternative investments for all four key &#x201c;jobs&#x201d; of a portfolio: safely generating more current income; decreasing risks of economic shocks; significantly increasing long-term profits; and protecting purchasing power over time.</p><p>Regardless of experience or net worth, readers will learn exactly what to do to substantially improve their investment performance&#x2014;in the same way that the world&#x2019;s best investors already do. Stocks and bonds alone aren&#x2019;t nearly enough. Investors need an Alternative Answer, and now they have it.</p></p><p><p>Bob Rice is Bloomberg TV's Alternative Investments Editor, the managing partner at Tangent Capital, and a board member of investment advisors with more than $2 billion under management. The positions he has held throughout his multifaceted career have spanned many domains: Wall Street law firm partner; public company CEO; trial lawyer for the U.S. Department of Justice; and technology entrepreneur.</p>In these hard economic times, in which savings-account yields are at an all-time low, stock-market volatility is a major concern, and real-estate appreciation is a thing of the past, Americans looking for alternatives to preserve or grow wealth may find this book to be a real eye-opener. Rice maintains that the key to long term wealth creation is loss avoidance, and he discusses options for building portfolios with built-in risk protection. The average consumer may not be aware that there are many other viable investment options besides traditional stocks and bonds, including private equity, venture capital, and more. Although hedge funds may have gotten a black eye during the Madoff era, he shows how active risk management using hedging strategies and a panoramic portfolio can help offset potential losses during times when stocks and bonds lose value. The writing is basic enough for novice investors, and ï¿½financial-concept examples are easy to follow. In this fresh look at the old investment rules, the alternatives presented are convincing enough for readers to consider. --Cindy Kryszak</p><h2>Letters from Home: Loving Messages from the Family (Kryon, Book 7)</h2><p>&#39;Most of the book was transcribed from live chanlellings all over the world....the entire subject of the book is &#39;change!&#39;&#39;. 10 chapters.</p><p></p><h2>Arrowsmith</h2><p>Martin Arrowsmith is a physician who is a seeker of truth after he is forced to give up successive jobs.</p><p>As the son and grandson of physicians, Sinclair Lewis had a store of experiences and imparted knowledge to draw upon for <i>Arrowsmith</i>.Published in 1925, after three years of anticipation, the book follows the life of Martin Arrowsmith, a rather ordinary fellow who gets his first taste of medicine at 14 as an assistant to the drunken physician in his home town. It is Leora Tozer who makes Martin's life extraordinary. With vitality and love, she urges him beyond the confines of the mundane to risk answering his true calling as a scientist and researcher. Not even her tragic death can extinguish her spirit or her impact on Martin's life.<b>Sinclair Lewis </b>was born in 1885 in Sauk Centre, Minnesota, and graduated from Yale University in 1908. His college career was interrupted by various part-time occupations, including a period working at the Helicon Home Colony, Upton Sinclair&#x2019;s socialist experiment in New Jersey. He worked for some years as a free lance editor and journalist, during which time he published several minor novels. But with the publication of <b>Main Street </b>(1920), which sold half a million copies, he achieved wide recognition. This was followed by the two novels considered by many to be his finest, <b>Babbitt </b>(1922) and <b>Arrowsmith </b>(1925), which was awarded the Pulitzer Prize in 1926, but declined by Lewis. In 1930, following <b>Elmer Gantry </b>(1927) and <b>Dodsworth </b>(1929), Sinclair Lewis became the first American author to be awarded the Nobel Prize for distinction in world literature. This was the apogee of his literary career, and in the period from <b>Ann Vickers </b>(1933) to the posthumously published <b>World So Wide </b>(1951) Lewis wrote ten novels that reveal the progressive decline of his creative powers. <b>From Main Street to Stockholm</b>, a collection of his letters, was published in 1952, and <b>The Man from Main Street</b>, a collection of essays, in 1953. During his last years Sinclair Lewis wandered extensively in Europe, and after his death in Rome in 1951 his ashes were returned to his birthplace.</p><h2>The American Republic</h2><p>Orestes Brownson&#x2019;s The American Republic was first published in 1865. The nation had just survived a Civil War that threatened to destroy the very life of a country less than one hundred years old. In this magisterial work, Brownson emerges as a political realist as well as a theorist. With brilliant and sobering thought Brownson presents his views on the nature, necessity, extent, authority, origin, and constitution of government in the light of the problems caused by secession and reconstruction. He urges his countrymen to consider their nation&#x2019;s role and impact on world history as he outlines for them the political and religious destiny of a government with "no prototype in any prior constitution." If the Federalist Papers of Madison, Hamilton, and Jay are among the best philosophical expositions of America&#x2019;s form of government at its founding, The American Republic of Brownson ought to enjoy a similar evaluation as a philosophical exposition of the union restored after the Civil War. This assessment is strongly reinforced by a major new evaluation of Brownson&#x2019;s enduring genius&#x2014;and continuing relevance&#x2014;by noted political philosopher Peter Augustine Lawler. Lawler&#x2019;s introduction constitutes a mini-book in itself, and will enrich the encounter of modern readers with the achievement of Orestes Brownson, a highly original American mind.</p><p>ORESTES BROWNSON&#x2019;S 1865 book, <i>The American Republic</i>, ranks with <i>The Federalist</i> and Alexis de Tocqueville&#x2019;s classic <i>Democracy in America</i> as an indispensable analysis of the American experiment in republican self-government. Reproduced here for the first time in a manner worthy of its importance, replete with its first comprehensive index, Regnery&#x2019;s edition of this important American classic is essential reading for anyone wishing to understand the ï¿½constitution, tendencies and destiny,&#x201d; to quote the book&#x2019;s subtitle, of the American regime. <br> <br>With philosophical rigor combined with linguistic beauty and lucidity, Brownson (1803ï¿½1876) probed and expanded upon the central thesis the United States was created to answer. <br> <br>Hamilton in <i>Federalist</i> No. 1 wrote that the American people live with a peculiar destiny: ï¿½to decide the important question, whether societies of men are really capable or not of establishing good government from reflection and choice, or whether they are forever destined to depend for their political constitutions on accident and force.&#x201d; Browson agreed and, taking advantage of a reflective mood after the bloodshed of the War Between the States, he sought to recover America&#x2019;s traditions of federalism and personal and religious liberty reconciled with law from ï¿½the most marked political tendency of the American people ... since 1825&#x201d; (the era of Jacksonian plebiscitary rule): ï¿½to interpret their government as a pure and simple democracy,&#x201d; thus casting themselves ï¿½from a civilized to a barbaric constitution.&#x201d; <br> <br>Brownson maintained that divine providence had bestowed upon every nation a constitution suited to each, and that it was only in careful conformity to this providential constitution that political actors should behave. <i>The American Republic</i> both illustrated the contours of that divine constitution that Brownson contended formed the backbone of the American political experience, and warned against dangerous ideas that threatened to undermine it. <br> <br>A one-time Congregationalist, Presbyterian, Universalist, humanitarian, Unitarian, and Transcendalist, Brownson spent the last 30 years of his life as a Roman Catholic. Without question, he was one of the most accomplished and illustrious American thinkers of the nineteenth century, and his work and career have invited comparisons to those of the celebrated John Henry Cardinal Newman, who called Brownson ï¿½by far the greatest thinker America has ever produced.&#x201d; Brownson could easily serve as the icon of his age: tumultuous, impetuous, at once delightful and provocative, always fascinatingï¿½and always read with profit. <br> <br>That is particularly true of <i>The American Republic</i>. Brownson&#x2019;s book is a great intellectual achievement and an important treatment of American political theory. <br> <br>Orestes Brownson (1803&#x2013;1876) was one of the nineteenth century&#x2019;s most fascinating&#x2014;and mercurial&#x2014;writers. A journalist, editor, apologist, and political philosopher, Brownson&#x2019;s intellectual restlessness launched him on a spiritual journey that led him through Congregationalism, Presbyterianism, Universalism, humanitarianism, and Unitarianism to, ultimately, Roman Catholicism. Sometimes referred to as America&#x2019;s John Henry Newman, The American Republic is his classic text. Peter Augustine Lawler is Dana Professor of Government at Berry College in Georgia.

Reprint.</p><p>Although J.A. Jance and Tony Hillerman (<i>Coyote Waits</i>, <i>The Fallen Man</i>) are in many ways poles apart as mystery writers, they are united on at least two fronts: their appreciation of the hypnotically arid beauty of the American Southwest; and their sense that this landscape is peculiarly capable of engendering horrific violence. In <i>Skeleton Canyon</i> Jance writes: "Overhead, the stars shone like glittering diamonds against a velvet sky. The starlight was so bright that the mountains, rocks, and trees around her emerged from the gloom. Sitting there in the half-lit dark of Skeleton Canyon, it was easy for Brianna to sense time falling away from her. This rugged, almost empty corner of the Arizona desert had changed so little that even now an occasional jaguar, roaming north from the mountains of Mexico, had been spotted by a solitary rancher. And if the wild canyons of the Peloncillos still played host to an assortment of wildlife, it wasn't so far off to imagine that human outlaws still ranged that same habitat as well."<p> Brianna O'Brien never returns from Skeleton Canyon, where she had waited under cover of darkness to rendezvous, <i>ï¿½ la</i> Juliet and Romeo, with her boyfriend, Ignacio Ybarra. In investigating Brianna's murder, Sheriff Joanna Brady must confront both the blatant racism of the O'Brien family--horrified to discover that their daughter could have been involved with a Mexican boy--and the family's dark past. There are skeletons in canyons, and skeletons as well locked behind the doors of the sprawling O'Brien compound. Home is where the heart is--but home is also host to a lethal nest of lies, greed, and secrets. <i>--Kelly Flynn</i></p>The Bookcassetteï¿½ format is a special recording technique developed as a means of condensing the full, unabridged audio text of a book to record it on fewer tapes.

First a Jamaican family, including the well-intentioned Gilbert, who can never manage to say or do exactly the right thing; Romeo Michael, who leaves a wake of women in his path; and finally, Hortense, whose primness belies her huge ambition to become English in every way possible. The other unhappy family is English, starting with Queenie, who escapes the drudgery of being a butcher's daughter only to marry a dull banker. As the chapters reverse chronology and the two groups collide and finally mesh, the book unfolds through time like a photo album, and Levy captures the struggle between class, race, and sex with a humor and tenderness that is both authentic and bracing. The book is cinematic in the best way--lighting up London's bombed-out houses and wartime existence with clarity and verve while never losing her character's voice or story. <i>--Meg Halverson</i>Winner of the 2004 Orange Prize for Fiction <br>A Picador Original Trade Paperback <br>Hortense Joseph arrives in London from Jamaica in 1948 with her life in her suitcase, her heart broken, her resolve intact. Her husband, Gilbert Joseph, returns from the war expecting to be received as a hero, but finds his status as a black man in Britain to be second class. His white landlady, Queenie, raised as a farmer's daughter, befriends Gilbert, and later Hortense, with innocence and courage, until the unexpected arrival of her husband, Bernard, who returns from combat with issues of his own to resolve. <br>Told in these four voices, "Small Island "is a courageous novel of tender emotion and sparkling wit, of crossings taken and passages lost, of shattering compassion and of reckless optimism in the face of insurmountable barriers---in short, an encapsulation of that most American of experiences: the immigrant's life. <br>Born in 1956 to Jamaican parents, Andrea Levy is the author of three previous novels and has received a British Arts Council Writers Award in addition to the Orange Prize and Whitbread distinctions.

Reality returns in slow degrees, as she registers the gray-washed walls, the dark-eyed windows, the empty side of the bed.<br><br>She heads for the bathroom, sticking her head under the faucet and gulping mouthfuls of lukewarm water. She can still hear the rain thundering outside. It seems like it has been raining forever this November, but maybe that&#x2019;s only her state of mind.<br><br>She goes into the kitchen.

It&#x2019;s the phone, not the baby, and it&#x2019;s for you. Snap out of it.&#x201d;<br><br>Carlton Kincaid&#x2019;s wife, Tina, elbowed him in the ribs. Then she tossed him the phone and burrowed back under the covers, pulling the down comforter over her mocha-colored head. Tina wasn&#x2019;t a middle-of-the-night sort of person.<br><br>Unfortunately, neither was Kincaid. Sergeant Detective, Major Crimes, Portland office of the Oregon State Police, he was supposed to be prepared for these sort of calls. Sound intelligent. Commanding even. Kincaid hadn&#x2019;t gotten a good night&#x2019;s sleep in nearly eight months now, however, and was feeling it. He stared sulkily at the phone, and thought it had better be damn good.<br><br>Kincaid sat up straight and attempted to sound chipper. &#x201c;Hell-oh.&#x201d;<br>A trooper was on the other end of the line. Had gotten called out by a local deputy to the scene of an abandoned vehicle on the side of a rural road in Tillamook County. So far no sign of the owner at the vehicle&#x2019;s site or at the owner&#x2019;s legal address.<br><br>Kincaid had one question. &#x201c;Is the vehicle on public or private property?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Dunno.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Well, figure it out, &#x2019;cause if it&#x2019;s private, we&#x2019;re gonna need consent to search the grounds. You&#x2019;ll also need to contact the local DA for a warrant to search the vehicle. So get the DA rolling, buckle up the scene, and I&#x2019;ll be there in&#x201d;&#x2013;Kincaid glanced at his watch&#x2013; &#x201c;fifty-five minutes.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes, sir.&#x201d;<br><br>The trooper hung up; Kincaid got moving. Kincaid had been with the OSP for the past twelve years. He&#x2019;d started as a trooper, spent some time on a gang task force, then transferred to Major Crimes. Along the way, he&#x2019;d acquired a beautiful wife, a big black mutt, and as of eight months ago, a bouncing baby boy. Life was going according to plan, if you included in that plan that neither he nor his wife had slept or chewed their food in over half a year.<br><br>Kids kept you hopping. So did Major Crimes.<br><br>He could hear the rain coming down in sheets off the roof. What a bitch of a night to be pulled out of bed. He kept two changes of clothes in the trunk of his take-home car. Night like this, that&#x2019;d get him through the first half hour. Shit. He looked back at the bed with a pang and wished it&#x2019;d been the baby crying after all.<br><br>Moving on autopilot, he dug through the dresser and started pulling on clothes. He was just buttoning up his shirt when his wife sighed and sat up.<br><br>&#x201c;Bad one?&#x201d; she whispered softly.<br><br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t know. Abandoned vehicle over in Bakersville.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Baby, what&#x2019;s that got to do with you?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Driver&#x2019;s-side door&#x2019;s open, engine&#x2019;s still running, and purse is sitting in the passenger&#x2019;s seat.&#x201d;<br>She frowned. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s weird.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yeah.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Baby, I hate the weird cases.&#x201d;<br><br>Kincaid pulled on his sports coat, crossed to his wife and planted a big one on her cheek. &#x201c;Go back to sleep, honey. Love you.&#x201d;<br><br>Tuesday, 1:14 a.m. PST<br>She can&#x2019;t see a damn thing. Her wipers are on high speed, flailing violently across her windshield. It makes no difference. The rain comes and comes and comes. Bend in the road. She takes the turn a little too late and promptly hydroplanes.<br><br>She is breathing hard now. Hiccupping. Is she crying? It&#x2019;s hard to tell, but she&#x2019;s grateful to be alone in the dark.<br><br>Easing off the gas, she steers carefully back into the proper lane. There are advantages to being out this late at night. No one else on the road to be punished by her mistakes.<br><br>She knows where she is going without ever telling herself. If she thought about it, then it would be a conscious decision, which would underline the fact she has a problem. Far easier to simply discover herself pulling into the parking lot of the Toasted Lab Tavern. Half a dozen other vehicles are sprinkled across the graveled lot, mostly wide-cab pickup trucks.<br><br>The hard-core drinkers, she thinks. You have to be hard-core to be out on a night like this.<br><br>What is she doing here?<br><br>She sits in her car, gripping the steering wheel hard. She can feel herself starting to shake. Her mouth is filling with saliva. She is already anticipating that first long, cold sip of beer.<br><br>For one moment, she hangs on the precipice.<br><br>Go home, Rainie. Go to bed, watch TV, read a book. Do something, do anything but this.<br><br>She is shaking harder, her entire body convulsing as she hunches over the wheel.<br><br>If she goes home, she will fall asleep. And if she falls asleep . . .<br><br>DO NOT climb those stairs. DO NOT open that door. DO NOT peer into the gloom.<br><br>There is so much darkness inside of her. She wants to be a real person. She wants to be strong, resolute, and sane. But mostly she feels the darkness move inside her head. It started four months ago, the first few tendrils fingering the corners of her mind. Now it consumes her. She has fallen into an abyss and she can no longer see the light.<br><br>Rainie hears a noise.<br><br>Her head comes up.<br><br>She sees a large figure loom ahead suddenly in the pouring rain. She doesn&#x2019;t scream. She grabs her gun.<br><br>The drunken cowboy lurches past, never knowing how close he came to losing his ass.<br><br>Rainie sets her Glock back down in the passenger seat. She is no longer trembling. She&#x2019;s wide-eyed. Grim-faced. A stone-cold sort of crazy, which is far, far worse.<br><br>She puts her car into gear and heads back into the night.<br><br>Tuesday, 3:35 a.m. PST<br>Bakersville, Oregon, was a small coastal town smack dab in the middle of Tillamook County. Nestled in the shadows of the towering coastal range inside Tillamook County. It featured endless acres of verdant dairy farms, miles of rocky beach, and from a detective&#x2019;s point of view, a growing methamphetamine problem. Pretty place to live if you were into honky-tonks and cheese. Not much else to do if you weren&#x2019;t, and didn&#x2019;t the local kids know it.<br><br>It should&#x2019;ve taken Kincaid fifty minutes to hit Bakersville. On a night like this, with zero visibility, slick mountain passes, and driving sheets of rain, it took Kincaid an hour fifteen. He pulled onto the lit-up site, breathing hard and already feeling behind the eight ball.<br><br>In the good-news department, the first responders had done their job. Three strategically placed spotlights glared into the night, high-powered beams slicing through the ribbons of rain. Yellow crime scene tape roped off a decent-sized perimeter, outside of which the vehicles were starting to pile up.<br><br>Kincaid noted a deputy&#x2019;s truck, then the sheriff&#x2019;s, then a slick black SUV with all the bells and whistles, which he figured belonged to the Tillamook County DA. They would need more bodies if they decided to launch a full-scale search, and they would need the forensic lab and Latent Prints to process the scene, but those would be his calls to make.<br><br>An hour and forty minutes after the first call out, they were still covering the basics: Did they, or did they not, have a crime? Most taxpayers probably liked to think the police went into these situations full bore. Notify the crime lab, bring in the National Guard, call in the choppers. Yeah, well, those same taxpayers kept hacking away at the OSP&#x2019;s budget, until Kincaid now had three and a half detectives working for him instead of the original fourteen. Real-world policing meant all decisions came attached to dollar signs. For better or for worse, these days he was operating on the cheap.<br><br>Kincaid pulled in behind the monstrous black Chevy Tahoe and cut his engine. No way around it. He opened his door and stepped out into the deluge.<br><br>The rain nailed him square on the forehead. For a moment, he paused, steeling himself against the onslaught. Then, his hair was soaked, the water trickled beneath the collar of his Columbia raincoat, and the worst of it was over. He no longer had to worry about getting muddy and wet; he was already there.<br><br>Kincaid trudged around to the trunk of his Chevy Impala, pulled out the giant plastic bin containing his crime scene kit, and ducked beneath the tape.<br><br>Trooper Blaney trotted over, black Danner boots splashing through the muck. A good doobie, he was wearing full department-issued rain gear, including a black-and-blue OSP jacket that looked like a biker coat gone bad. No one really liked the jacket. Kincaid kept his stashed in the trunk for the rare occasions the press was around&#x2013;or a superior officer.<br><br>Blaney had obviously been standing outside awhile; his coat looked slick as glass beneath the high-powered lights, while beneath the cover of his wide-brim hat, the water ran in rivulets down his square-jawed face and dripped off the end of his nose. Blaney stuck out his hand; Kincaid returned the favor.<br><br>&#x201c;Trooper.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Sergeant.&#x201d;<br><br>The Tillamook County sheriff and a deputy had followed in the trooper&#x2019;s wake. Blaney made the introductions as they all stood in a rain-soaked huddle, teeth chattering, arms tight against their sides for warmth.<br><br>Deputy Dan Mitchell had been the first responder. Kid was young, farming stock, but trying hard. He didn&#x2019;t like the look of things&#x2013;the open door, headlights on, engine running. Seemed kind of Hollywood to him. So he&#x2019;d called Sheriff Atkins, who hadn&#x2019;t been wild to be pulled out of bed on such a night, but had headed down.<br><br>The sheriff was a bit of a surprise. For one thing, he was a she&#x2013;that would be Sheriff Shelly Atkins to you. For another, she had a firm handshake, a no-nonsense stare, and apparently didn&#x2019;t feel like beating around the bush.<br><br>&#x201c;Look,&#x201d; she interjected halfway through her deputy&#x2019;s energetic spiel, &#x201c;Tom&#x2019;s waiting&#x201d;&#x2013;she jerked her head toward the DA, who Kincaid now saw was tucked back inside his SUV. &#x201c;We got a search warrant for the car and, per your trooper&#x2019;s instructions, we&#x2019;ve confirmed this is public land. Now, I don&#x2019;t know what the hell happened here, but someone left that car in a hurry, and that&#x2019;s a source of concern for me. So let&#x2019;s get this ball rolling, or there won&#x2019;t be anything left to find but a bunch of soggy police reports.&#x201d;<br><br>No one could argue with that logic, so their little scrum moved toward the car, edging carefully toward the open door.<br><br>Vehicle was a late-model Toyota Camry, white exterior, blue cloth interior. Nice, but nothing fancy. The driver had pulled well over, conscientiously trying to get off the road. To the left of the <br>driver&#x2019;s door was the winding backwoods lane. To the right was a steep embankment leading up into a heavily shrouded forest.<br><br>As the trooper had reported by phone, the driver&#x2019;s-side door was slung wide open, tip of the door scraping the edge of the asphalt. Kincaid&#x2019;s first thought was that most people didn&#x2019;t open their doors that far. Maybe if they had really long legs. Or maybe if they were loading something in and out of the car.<br><br>Something to think about.<br><br>From this angle, Kincaid could make out the shape of a brown leather handbag sitting in the passenger&#x2019;s seat.<br><br>&#x201c;Did you check the purse?&#x201d; he asked no one in particular.<br><br>&#x201c;I picked it up,&#x201d; Deputy Mitchell reported, already sounding defensive. &#x201c;To check for ID, you know. I mean, it just seemed strange to find the car, lights on, engine running, door open wide as day. I had to start somewhere.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Did you find a wallet?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No, sir. But then I opened the glove compartment and found the vehicle registration. I pulled the name off that.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Purse was empty?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No, sir. Lots of stuff in the purse&#x2013;cosmetics, pens, PDA, etc. But I didn&#x2019;t see anything that looked like a wallet. I placed the purse back just how I found it. Swear to God I touched nothing else.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Except the glove compartment,&#x201d; Kincaid said mildly, but he wasn&#x2019;t really angry. The deputy was right&#x2013;you had to start somewhere.<br><br>The car&#x2019;s engine had been turned off; the trooper had done it to preserve the tank of gas. Always useful when you found an abandoned vehicle, to see how much gas was left in the tank. But the engine had been running fine when Deputy Mitchell had arrived, and at a glance, there was nothing wrong with the tires. Seemed to rule out pulling over due to mechanical problems.<br><br>Kincaid walked to the rear of the Camry, eyeing the fender. No sign of dents or scrapes, though it was hard to tell with everything so wet. He made a halfhearted attempt to look for other tire tracks or footprints. The driving rain had destroyed the ground, leaving nothing but shallow pools of muddy water. Sheriff Atkins&#x2019;s warning had been on the money, but a dime too late.<br><br>He moved to the interior of the vehicle, careful not to touch.<br>&#x201c;Owner a woman?&#x201d; he asked.<br><br>&#x201c;According to the registration,&#x201d; Trooper Blaney supplied, &#x201c;name is Lorraine Conner from Bakersville. Sheriff Atkins sent a deputy to the address. No one answered.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Do we have a physical description?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;According to DMV records, she&#x2019;s five six, 120 pounds, brown hair, blue eyes.&#x201d;<br><br>Kincaid eyed Sheriff Atkins.<br><br>&#x201c;Five five,&#x201d; she supplied. &#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t want to touch anything just yet, but at a glance, the seat looks about right.&#x201d;<br><br>That&#x2019;s what Kincaid thought, too. Seat was fairly close, about what he&#x2019;d expect. He needed to check the mirrors, of course, steering column, too, but that&#x2019;d have to wait until after the lab rats and Latent Prints were done. According to Blaney, the gas tank had registered half full before he&#x2019;d shut down the engine, so while they&#x2019;d canvass the local gas stations just to be safe, Lorraine probably hadn&#x2019;t fueled up recently.<br><br>He straightened, blinking his eyes against the rain while the wheels of his mind started to turn.<br><br>Kincaid had spent his first three years as a trooper working along the coast. It amazed him how many of his reports had started with the discovery of an abandoned vehicle. The ocean seemed to draw people, speak to them one last time. So they&#x2019;d drive out to the coast, catch that final glorious sunset. Then they&#x2019;d lock up their vehicle, head into the woods, and blow out their brains.<br><br>But in all of Kincaid&#x2019;s years, he&#x2019;d never seen anyone walk away from a car like this&#x2013;engine idling, windshield wipers beating, headlights beaming.<br><br>Deputy Mitchell had been right. The scene was too Hollywood. It felt wrong.<br><br>&#x201c;All right,&#x201d; Kincaid said. &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s pop the trunk.&#x201d;</p><h2>Children&#39;s Writer&#39;s Word Book</h2><p>In this revised and expanded 2nd edition, <i>Children's Writer's Word Book</i> helps you immediately determine if you're using the right vocabulary and language for your audience.

Stripped of any preciousness or sentimentality, Natalia Ginzburg's writing here is white-hot, tempered by rage. She transforms the unhappy tale of an ordinary dull marriage into a rich psychological thriller that seems to beg the question: why don't more wives kill their husbands?</p><p><p><strong>Natalia Ginzburg</strong> (1916&#x2013;1991), &#x201c;who authored twelve books and two plays; who, because of anti-Semitic laws, sometimes couldn&#x2019;t publish under her own name; who raised five children and lost her husband to Fascist torture; who was elected to the Italian parliament as an independent in her late sixties&#x2015;this woman does not take her present conditions as a given. She asks us to fight back against them, to be brave and resolute. She instructs us to ask for better, for ourselves and for our children&#x201d; (Belle Boggs, <em>The New Yorker</em>).</p><p><strong>Frances Frenaye</strong> (1908&#x2013;1996) was an American translator of French and Italian literary works. She worked at the Italian Cultural Institute from 1963 to 1980 and was responsible for editing its newsletter. She won the Denyse Clairouin Memorial Award (1951) for her translation from French to English of Georges Blond&#x2019;s<em>&nbsp;The Plunderers</em> and J.H.R. Lenormand&#x2019;s&nbsp;<em>Renee</em>. She also wrote for an Italian newspaper,<em>&nbsp;Il Mondo</em>, for some time. Frenaye graduated from Bryn Mawr College and spent 50 years living in Manhattan before dying in Miami Beach.</p>&#x201c;Originally published in 1947, <em>The Dry Heart</em> is by far Ginzberg&#x2019;s strangest work of fiction, a taught psychological thriller laced with horror about a woman who &#x2015; very matter-of-factly in the first few sentences &#x2015; murders her husband. &#x201c;I shot him between the eyes,&#x201d; the nameless narrator says, then goes out for coffee. Short enough to read in one sitting, it&#x2019;s a feminist classic that exposes the dark side of marriage in clean, captivating prose.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Chicago Tribune</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Marriage, which had seemed an enchanting escape from her tedious, impoverished isolation&#x2015;the &#x201c;worn gloves and very little spending money,&#x201d; the &#x201c;dingy boarding-house,&#x201d; the chilly schoolroom in which she taught Ovid&#x2015;is in every way disappointing. (It probably doesn&#x2019;t help that the husband&#x2019;s mistress has told her she looks &#x201c;like too much of a simple country girl&#x201d; to murder anyone.) The prose is plain, direct but restrained, and much goes unsaid. Domestic life, its frustrations and miseries, occupies the foreground, the outside world barely discernible at the edges.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Lidija Haas, <em>Harper's</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Unvarnished: Ginzburg, it's clear, is a master of the deceptively simple plot. To say that she's&nbsp;understated is itself a serious understatement. This slim, swift book was first published in Italy in 1947, but it feels chillingly modern. Haunting, spare, and utterly gorgeous, Ginzburg's novel is a classic.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Kirkus (starred)</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Ginzburg modernizes the form...Between generational differences, genealogical secrets, former and secret lovers, and the desires and limitations related to real and aspirational social milieux, Ginzburg seems to suggest that in the sphere of the family there is always more to tell, and differently.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Los Angeles Review of Books</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;A flawlessly negotiated descent into the deep and dangerous chasm separating love&#x2019;s fantasies from life&#x2019;s realities.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Los Angeles Times</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;What impels her forward is the voice: free, pellucid, almost always first-person, interested not in the long view but in the here and now.&nbsp;&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>The New Republic</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Her observations are swift and exact, usually irradiated by an unruly and often satirical humor. The instrument with which she writes is fine, wonderfully flexible and keen, and the quality of her attention is singular. The voice is pure and unmannered, both entrancing and alarming, elegantly streamlined by the authority of a powerful intelligence.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Deborah Eisenberg, <em>The New York Review of Books</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;This book is a Roman candle &#x2015; quick and explosive.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>The New York Times</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Where does style come from? Is it knowingly constructed or unconsciously secreted? Invented or inherited? These questions dog me whenever I read Ginzburg, whose thumbprint is so unmistakable, so inscribed by her time, yet whose work stands so solidly that it requires no background information to appreciate.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>The New York Times</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Ginzburg never raises her voice, never strains for effect, never judges her creations. Though blessed with the rhythms and tensile strength of verse, her language is economical and spare, subordinate to the demands of the story. Like Chekhov, she knows how to stand back and let her characters expose their own lives, their frailties and strengths, their illusions and private griefs. The result is nearly translucent writing&#x2015;writing so clear, so direct, so seemingly simple that it gives the reader the magical sense of apprehending the world for the first time.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Michiko Kakutani, <em>The New York Times</em></strong></p><h2>Seasons of Your Heart: Prayers and Reflections, Revised and Expanded</h2><p><p>In this masterpiece of simplicity, Macrina Wiederkehr offers a series of meditations to bring us closer to a "God for all seasons," revised and expanded into this new edition. </p><p>Designed for daily use as well as for retreats, <em>Seasons of Your Heart</em> is an eloquent and lyrical invitation to journey through the spiritual seasons of wonder, hope, love, mystery, and faith. </p><p>Macrina Weiderkehr shares her "seasonal struggle with God" and encourages us to reconize those same peaks and valleys in our own spiritual life.

He shows how the NRA and conservative Supreme Court justices used specious logic to invent a virtually unlimited individual right to own guns, which has enabled the ever-growing number of mass shootings in the United States. But Hartmann also identifies a handful of powerful, commonsense solutions that would break the power of the gun lobby and restore the understanding of the Second Amendment that the Framers of the Constitution intended. This is the kind of brief, brilliant analysis for which Hartmann is justly renowned.</p><p><b>Thom Hartmann</b> is a progressive national and internationally syndicated talk show host. <i>Talkers Magazine</i> named him America's #1 most important progressive host and the host of one of the top 10 talk radio shows in the country every year for over a decade. A four-time recipient of the Project Censored Award, Hartmann is also a <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of twenty-four books, translated in multiple languages.&#x201c;34,000 REASONS TO READ THIS BOOK: That&#x2019;s the number of gun-related deaths annually in America.&#x201d; <br> <b>&#x2014;Norman Lear</b><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;There is so much fascinating, I-didn&#x2019;t-know-that history, my entire copy of&nbsp;<i>Hidden History</i>&nbsp;has turned yellow from highlighting stuff that&#x2019;s cool, amazing, and vital. I didn&#x2019;t know that Thomas Jefferson demanded passage of the Second Amendment so citizen militias would eliminate the need for our new nation to have a standing army. I didn&#x2019;t know that the first big gun control campaign was the KKK&#x2019;s seizing of weapons from black citizens, kicking off a century of Jim Crow. Hartmann, who lets us know he enjoys squeezing off a few rounds from a semiautomatic handgun, eschews the usual BS we hear from both the NRA and NPR. Guns kill, but in an America where most gun deaths are suicides, Hartmann proves with undeniable stats that the bullets are loaded by despair and inequality. Truly a tour de force in a quick read. I&#x2019;m a gun control skeptic, but I'll admit, Hartmann&#x2019;s book blew me away.&#x201d;<br> <b>&#x2014;Greg Palast, Puffin Foundation fellow in investigative reporting and author of the <i>New York Times</i> bestseller <i>The Best Democracy Money Can Buy</i></b><br> <i>&nbsp;</i><br> &#x201c;In this riveting book, <i>The Hidden History of Guns and the Second Amendment</i>, Thom Hartmann exposes the searing social and human costs of a nation awash in firearms.&nbsp;Because it is impossible to understand the present without understanding the past, Hartmann shows how the history of genocide and slavery forms the bedrock of United States history and how the Second Amendment was ratified to preserve that racist framework. The book compellingly examines the myths at the root of modern American gun culture and how that culture emerged in reaction to social and economic changes in the United States, as well as savvy marketing and legal maneuvering by weapons manufacturers.&nbsp;As the humane journalist and thinker that he is, Hartmann makes sure to fuse history and the present by offering&nbsp;an array of realistic and ramifying solutions to &#x2018;cure&#x2019; America of its gun violence epidemic.&#x201d; <br> <b>&#x2014;Katrina vanden Heuvel, Editor and Publisher, <i>The Nation</i>&nbsp;</b><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Thom Hartmann&#x2019;s new book on America and guns achieves the impossible: it is brief yet definitive. I couldn&#x2019;t put it down. And now I can&#x2019;t stop thinking about it.&#x201d;<br> <b>&#x2014;Scott Carter, playwright (<i>Discord</i>, <i>C.3.3</i>) and Executive Producer, <i>Real Time with Bill Maher</i></b><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;When Thom Hartmann talks, I listen. What Thom Hartmann writes, I read. This book about the history of guns in America&#x2014;and most importantly, what should be the future of guns in America&#x2014;is important, mind-opening, and profoundly helpful.&#x201d;<br> <b>&#x2014;Marianne Williamson</b><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Among the many hidden truths about our gun culture and politics Thom reveals are the prerevolutionary connections of guns and slave control, as well as guns and Native American genocide. Reading this book dispels the connections we all assume, that the Second Amendment was fundamentally about freedom versus the minority controlling the majority, racism triumphing over human rights. Most importantly, Thom tells us what we can do right now to move forward.&#x201d;<br> <b>&#x2014;Larry Cohen, Chair, Our Revolution; Past President, Communications Workers of America; and Founding Chair, Democracy Initiative</b><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;With <i>The Hidden History of Guns and the Second Amendment</i>, Thom Hartmann adroitly links the relationship of guns to slavery from Columbus through Reconstruction to racism in present-day America. He explains how common-sense gun regulation has dramatically reduced mass shootings, suicides, and other terrors of gun violence in countries like Australia. This book should be required reading for every legislator.&#x201d; <br> <b>&#x2014;Earl Katz, political ethicist and Emmy-nominated documentary producer</b><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Ask yourself this: How did the United States, with 5 percent of the population, end up with 50 percent of all the guns, worldwide, in civilian hands? If you can&#x2019;t answer that question, or if that statistic itself shocks you, then read Thom Hartmann&#x2019;s brilliant <i>The Hidden History of Guns and the Second Amendment</i>. From our blood-soaked history to practical, proven solutions, the book is illuminating, infuriating, and motivating. It should be required reading for every high school student&#x2014;and member of Congress.&#x201d; <br> <b>&#x2014;Medea Benjamin, author and cofounder of CODEPINK</b><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Unfortunately, the debate about guns in the United States has been intractable and inflammatory. Thankfully, Thom Hartmann sets the score straight in his new book about firearms in America and the Second Amendment. One by one, he rips away the false narratives and myths about guns in the United States. This is a powerful book that is incisive as a stepping-stone to a new understanding about and approach to gun reform in the Wild West of nations.&#x201d; <br> <b>&#x2014;Mark Karlin, founder of BuzzFlash.com and former Chairman and President, Illinois Council Against Handgun Violence</b><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;It&#x2019;s no surprise to anyone that Thom Hartmann is a prolific, brilliant, bestselling author and talk radio host. What is a surprise is when the man meets the moment so perfectly. That happens in his new book, <i>The Hidden History of Guns and the Second Amendment</i>.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;This profoundly personal yet typically insightful historical work so wonderfully encapsulates the pulse of our time and the sea change the Parkland kids and others have made in our national, and deadly, struggle with guns in America. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Thom Hartmann is a national treasure, and so is this book.&#x201d; <br> <b>&#x2014;Stephanie Miller, national radio host </b><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Political sloganeering aside, guns do in fact&nbsp;<i>kill</i>&nbsp;people. Tens of thousands of Americans are gunned down year after year in their homes, churches, schools, offices, cars, theaters, at birthday parties, playgrounds, music events&#x2014;anywhere and everywhere. It&#x2019;s a national plague directly traceable to a handful of corporate profiteers, gun lobby extremists, and gutless politicians. In this liberating book, Thom Hartmann exposes their scam and proposes a path to gun sanity.&#x201d;<br> <b>&#x2014;Jim Hightower, populist radio commentator, syndicated columnist, and editor of&nbsp;the monthly newsletter <i>The Hightower Lowdown</i></b><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;There is a widely accepted false choice that either we protect the lives of our schoolchildren or we protect our freedom to own guns, but we can&#x2019;t do both. If you want to understand how we&#x2019;ve come to think in such black-and-white terms and how the debate over guns has become so polarized as to seem intractable, this book is for you. And if you want a sane, wise, and informed way to resolve the problem, this book is most definitely for you. Thom Hartmann is one of our most brilliant and most compassionate thought leaders. Read this book and you&#x2019;ll be inspired and encouraged by practical answers and a true path forward.&#x201d;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br> <b>&#x2014;John Robbins, bestselling author and cofounder and President, Food Revolution Network</b><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Hartmann has given us a riveting chronicle of the history of America&#x2019;s gun culture. Hartmann at once unravels the anemic underpinnings of the deafening claims by gun rights advocates for constitutional sanction while showing how gun rights ideology, born from slavery, is rooted in racial hatred and tribalism manipulated by economic demands of racketeering gun manufacturers and their corporate and political allies.&#x201d; <br> <b>&#x2014;Bobby Kennedy</b><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;No one does a better job of rolling out the Constitution, opening up the historical records, and separating fact from fiction than Thom Hartmann.

As he walked past the open door, he saw a car driving up the dirt road toward the farm. It was traveling too fast, jolting, dust billowing up behind it. Yuki stopped and watched. He could see that the car was a new &#x2019;41 Ford&#x2014;a fancier car than he usually saw this far away from Berkeley&#x2014;and Yuki was almost sure he knew what that meant. He felt himself tighten, his chest suddenly rigid, but he had no idea what he should do.<br> <br>The black car stopped between the storage shed and the house. Two men got out, both of them wearing dark suits and hats. They each turned and looked around, clearly checking out the farm, the buildings. One of the men noticed Yuki, so Yuki stepped from the shed and tried to look calm. He walked toward the tall man on the driver&#x2019;s side. The man removed his hat and asked, &#x201c;Is your father home, young man?&#x201d;<br> <br>Yuki didn&#x2019;t like the look of the guy. His dark hair was combed back slick, and his shirt collar was stiff and bright white&#x2014;like he was someone official. His voice had sounded polite, but the look in his narrowed eyes was menacing.<br> <br>&#x201c;Are you produce buyers, or&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;We need to talk to your father.&#x201d; The man&#x2019;s tone was suddenly curt, but then he brought it under control as he said, &#x201c;Would you please take us to him?&#x201d;<br> <br>Yuki thought of running to his father, telling him to hide. But he knew he couldn&#x2019;t do that. &#x201c;I saw him walk into the house a few minutes ago,&#x201d; Yuki said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll see if he&#x2019;s still there.&#x201d; He walked past the man and headed toward the house.<br> <br>Both men followed, walking fast enough to keep up. The second man&#x2014;a smaller fellow with a brown suit, black hair, dark eyes&#x2014;caught up to Yuki at the front door, where Yuki stopped to remove his boots. &#x201c;Leave your shoes on,&#x201d; the man said. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ll go in with you. Just tell your father someone wants to see him&#x2014;nothing else.&#x201d; He had a low, hard voice and some kind of accent, maybe New York. Yuki nodded, but he shoved the door open and stepped hard on the hardwood floor inside. He wanted to make as much noise as possible. The two men separated inside the little living room and stood on either side of him. Yuki thought of shouting to his father, telling him to run out the back door, but Father would never do that. He would be respectful. It was the way he dealt with white people, always.<br> <br>When Yuki took a step toward the kitchen, the bigger man reached out and grabbed his shoulder, held him back. And then he announced, &#x201c;Mr. Nakahara, we need to speak to you. We&#x2019;re agents from the Federal Bureau of Investigation.&#x201d;<br> <br>Yuki&#x2019;s mother stepped into the living room from the kitchen. She was wearing a white apron over her housedress. Her hair was pulled back tight against her head. She was tiny, but now she took a breath and raised her shoulders. She looked directly at the men&#x2014;one and then the other. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m Mrs. Nakahara. What may I do for you?&#x201d; she asked.<br> <br>The man removed his hat. &#x201c;Is Mr. Nakahara at home?&#x201d; he asked.<br> <br>&#x201c;Is there anything I can&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;My name is Agent Carson. This is Agent Aldo. As I said, we&#x2019;re from the FBI. We need to speak to your husband.&#x201d; Now there was more force in his voice.<br> <br>Father had appeared by then, behind Mother. He was wearing his work clothes, a bulky wool jacket over overalls. He had taken off his boots, and in his stocking feet, he seemed to shrink before the men.<br> <br>&#x201c;Are you Mr. Nakahara?&#x201d;<br> <br>Father nodded, or maybe bowed just slightly.<br> <br>&#x201c;Do you publish a Japanese-language newspaper?&#x201d;<br> <br>He nodded again.<br> <br>&#x201c;We understand you keep close ties to people in Japan. Is that right?&#x201d;<br> <br>Mother said, &#x201c;He doesn&#x2019;t speak much English, Mr. Carson. He has relatives in Japan, and he writes letters to them now and then, but his ties are all to this country now. He has lived here for more than thirty years.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Well, that&#x2019;s what you say,&#x201d; Agent Aldo said. &#x201c;But he&#x2019;s on our list. Tell him we&#x2019;re arresting him.&#x201d;<br> <br>Yuki&#x2019;s breath stopped.<br> <br>Father spoke better English than Mother was letting on, and he had surely understood the word &#x201c;arrest,&#x201d; but he didn&#x2019;t move, didn&#x2019;t show any reaction.<br> <br>Mother&#x2019;s hands had jumped, as though of their own accord, but then she grasped them together. Yuki saw her blink, knew she was fighting tears, but her voice was strong when she said, &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t understand. What are the charges against my husband?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I told you, he&#x2019;s on a list. Tell him he&#x2019;s got to come with us.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;But you can&#x2019;t arrest him for no reason. He hasn&#x2019;t done anything wrong.&#x201d; She took a step sideways, placing herself in front of her husband.<br> <br>&#x201c;If that&#x2019;s the case, he has nothing to worry about,&#x201d; Agent Carson said. &#x201c;But for right now, he has to come with us.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Where will you take him?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry, ma&#x2019;am, it&#x2019;s not our job to explain everything to you. We&#x2019;ve been sent to bring him in. I guess you&#x2019;ll hear from others who can tell you the details.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Must he go with you right now? Can&#x2019;t he&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m afraid we&#x2019;re going to take him now. We do need to search your house, however. I want you and your son to sit right here in the living room while we put your husband in our car. Then one of us will come back and do the search.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Search for what?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Look, lady,&#x201d; Aldo said, &#x201c;you don&#x2019;t ask the questions. We do. Sit down, you and your son. Do you have other children?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes. Two daughters and another son.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Where are they?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Not home from school yet. They come on a bus.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;And what about you?&#x201d; He looked at Yuki. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t you go to school?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I get out earlier, so I help my father on the farm. We work hard. We&#x2019;re Americans. We&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Stop right there. I don&#x2019;t want to hear all that,&#x201d; Aldo said.<br> <br>Carson put up his hand, as if to say &#x201c;That&#x2019;s enough&#x201d; to his partner. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re going to ask you to go with us now, Mr. Nakahara,&#x201d; he said.<br> <br>&#x201c;I must change clothes,&#x201d; Father said.<br> <br>&#x201c;No, sir, you don&#x2019;t need to do that. They&#x2019;ll have clothes for you where you&#x2019;re going. Were those your shoes on the porch?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Just grab them as we go out. That&#x2019;s all you&#x2019;ll need.&#x201d;<br> <br>Agent Aldo stepped forward and took hold of Mr. Nakahara&#x2019;s arm. &#x201c;Come with us now,&#x201d; he said. He pulled on Father&#x2019;s elbow and Father stumbled forward, then caught his balance and looked at Mother. &#x201c;Where am I going?&#x201d; he asked in Japanese. Yuki had attended Japanese language school when he was younger. He didn&#x2019;t speak Japanese fluently, but he understood most things his parents said.<br> <br>Mother didn&#x2019;t answer her husband. She stepped toward Carson. &#x201c;You can&#x2019;t do this. This is America. You must tell us what he is charged with.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You speak English very well,&#x201d; Carson said in an almost friendly tone. &#x201c;How long have you lived in our country?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Most of my life. It&#x2019;s my country too.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re an enemy alien, ma&#x2019;am. Not a citizen.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;My children are citizens. How can you take their father from them?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;We don&#x2019;t get into all that. We just&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I learned about American laws in school. You must tell my husband which law he&#x2019;s broken. You cannot take him away without doing that.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Actually, in time of war, in a war zone, under direction of our government, we can arrest those who may be a danger to others. This area has been designated a war zone by the government, and your husband has been listed as a probable spy. We don&#x2019;t have to tell you all that, but now we have. Please get out of our way and let us do our job.&#x201d; He took hold of Father&#x2019;s other arm, at the elbow, and the two men led him toward the door, Father not resisting.<br> <br>&#x201c;You must not do this,&#x201d; Mother was saying, her voice now desperate. She rushed ahead, got between the men and the front door. &#x201c;My husband is not a danger to anyone. Can&#x2019;t you see that?&#x201d;<br> <br>Aldo turned suddenly and stepped close to Mother. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s enough, lady. Your husband&#x2019;s a sneaky little slant-eyed Jap. That&#x2019;s all we need to know.&#x201d; He glared into her eyes, as if to see how she might react, but Mrs. Nakahara&#x2019;s face only hardened. &#x201c;On Sunday a bunch of sneaky slant-eyed Japs&#x2014;just like him&#x2014;bombed our country. His crime is, he&#x2019;s on their side, not ours. And we&#x2019;re not going to let him make contact with his buddies who are waging a war against us. Now, get out of our way or I&#x2019;ll take you in with him.&#x201d; He used his forearm to sweep her aside.<br> <br>Yuki had watched all this, not knowing what to do or say, but he finally reacted. As the men took Father out the door, he followed, and then he hurried in front of Agent Carson and stood his ground. &#x201c;Listen, sir, we run a business here. We grow fruits and vegetables and sell them at a stand down on the highway. I think you&#x2019;ve gotten the wrong idea about us somehow. Is there someone we could talk to? I think this could all be straightened out in a few minutes. My father has a little newspaper that he sends out to the old-timers from Japan around here, but that&#x2019;s all it is. He doesn&#x2019;t bother anyone at all. He&#x2019;s no troublemaker.&#x201d;<br> <br>It was Aldo who answered. &#x201c;Oh, I see. I&#x2019;m glad you cleared that up for us. But you know what? You&#x2019;re a sneaky little slant-eyed Jap yourself, and I don&#x2019;t trust you any more than your traitor of a dad. Now, shut your mouth and go back in the house.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;But there&#x2019;s no need for this, sir. Isn&#x2019;t there someone I can talk to?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yeah. Talk to Mr. Hirohito, the emperor of Japan. See what he can do for you. Now, get out of my way.&#x201d;<br> <br>Yuki&#x2019;s anger suddenly fired. &#x201c;You can&#x2019;t treat us like this!&#x201d; he yelled into Aldo&#x2019;s face.<br> <br>Aldo slammed both hands into Yuki&#x2019;s chest, sent him stumbling backward. In his rage, Yuki was about to charge the man, but he heard his father&#x2019;s voice, not loud, but firm. &#x201c;No!&#x201d;<br> <br>Yuki stopped at the command, but mostly because he knew that he was only making things worse.<br> <br>&#x201c;Shikata ga nai,&#x201d; Father said.<br> <br>Yuki hated that idea, &#x201c;it can&#x2019;t be helped.&#x201d; It was something his father believed and often said. It was the Japanese way of thinking&#x2014;the old way. Yuki was too American for such acceptance. And yet, there really was nothing he could do. He stepped aside.<br> <br>Carson grabbed Father&#x2019;s boots, and the two men pushed past Yuki, then opened the car door and forced Father into the backseat. Aldo stayed outside by the car, apparently to make sure that Father didn&#x2019;t try to make a run for it. Carson returned to the house, and he systematically worked his way through the five rooms while Yuki sat with his mother, his arm around her shoulders. All that strength she had tried to show was gone now and she was weeping, her hands over her face.<br> <br>&#x201c;I knew this was coming,&#x201d; Yuki said. &#x201c;All Father thinks about is Japan. I told him to burn all the Japanese stuff he has around the house, but he wouldn&#x2019;t do it.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;How could he do that?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;The same way a lot of people have been doing.&#x201d;<br> <br>Yuki had talked to his friend Shigeo Omura about the things happening in California these last few days, since Japan had bombed Pearl Harbor and war had been declared. At lunch on Tuesday, Shig had whispered to him, &#x201c;They&#x2019;re rounding up anyone who&#x2019;s considered a community leader. Your dad&#x2019;s known&#x2014;because of his newspaper. He&#x2019;s got to throw out that Buddhist shrine he keeps in your house. My parents have gotten rid of everything in our house that looks Japanese.&#x201d;<br> <br>Yuki had told his father what he needed to do, but Father had said nothing, done nothing. It was always his way. A son didn&#x2019;t tell a father what to do.<br> <br>&#x201c;My father&#x2019;s not like yours,&#x201d; Yuki had told Shig. But he decided not to explain what he meant by that. Instead, he asked, &#x201c;How are kids treating you?&#x201d;<br> <br>Yuki and Shig had carried their lunches to school in paper bags. When Yuki was younger, his mother had prepared him a Japanese bento box, with rice and fish, but kids had turned up their noses at the smell. In high school, he and Shig had switched to bologna sandwiches and apples, like everyone else. But this week, since the attack on Pearl Harbor, they had sat in a corner of the lunchroom, at the end of a table, away from others.<br> <br>&#x201c;They stare at me,&#x201d; Shig said. &#x201c;No one&#x2019;s ever paid any attention to me before, and they&#x2019;re not saying anything to me now, but all week, I&#x2019;ve seen them looking at me&#x2014;like I&#x2019;m not the guy I was before.&#x201d;<br> <br>Yuki nodded. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s been the same for me,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Some boy I don&#x2019;t even know said I should &#x2018;go back to Japan&#x2019;&#x2014;like I&#x2019;ve ever been there. But he didn&#x2019;t say it to my face. He whispered it behind me in the hallway and then he slipped into the crowd so he didn&#x2019;t have to look me in the eye.&#x201d;<br> <br>Two girls approached the table with their lunches, but they stopped short and turned away, leaving the table mostly empty in the crowded lunchroom. Yuki thought of welcoming them, but he knew that although it would have been all right the week before, it wasn&#x2019;t now.<br> <br>&#x201c;People like you, Yuki,&#x201d; Shig said. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re popular. They&#x2019;ll get over the shock before long, and they&#x2019;ll know you haven&#x2019;t changed. But me, I&#x2019;m just the little shrimp I&#x2019;ve always been. The war only makes things worse.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Hey, you&#x2019;re the best second baseman this school&#x2019;s ever had. The guys who play with us know that.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;That doesn&#x2019;t matter anymore.&#x201d;<br> <br>Yuki and Shig had played baseball together for many years. Yuki had always played shortstop and Shig second base, and they had become a great double-play combination. It was true that Shig was really small&#x2014;only about five feet tall&#x2014;and he was quiet, so maybe that was why people didn&#x2019;t notice him around the school. The ballplayers had always teased him about having no strike zone and about wearing glasses. But Shig was smart, and when he let loose a little, he was funny. He let Yuki get all the attention and do most of the talking, but when Yuki was struggling, especially with his stern father, Shig would always listen.<br> <br>What Yuki also knew was that he was going to need Shig more than ever now that the white kids were turning away from them. He had always considered himself friends with people of all races. He had played sports, gone to dances, hung out at soda fountains, and girls had liked to dance with him because he did the jitterbug so well. He had bought himself an old jalopy of a car and had taken girlfriends to the movies, worn the latest styles, been a regular guy. Now&#x2014;overnight&#x2014;he was &#x201c;the enemy.&#x201d;<br> <br>The lunchroom was full of noise, the same as ever. Maybe a war had started, but kids were talking and laughing the way they always had. But now Yuki could see three Japanese American girls he knew headed for the table where he and Shig were sitting. This was becoming an island for the Japanese students, and yet, that was the last thing any of them wanted.<br> <br>&#x201c;Will you stick with me, Yuki?&#x201d; Shig asked.<br> <br>Yuki was taking a drink from his Coke bottle. He put it down. &#x201c;What do you mean, Shig? Of course I&#x2019;ll&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s going to be tougher now. This war might last a long time. If people are going to stare at me all day, every day, I&#x2019;m going to go crazy. I need someone I can be &#x2018;normal&#x2019; around.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Hey, I need the same thing. We&#x2019;ll look out for each other.&#x201d;<br> <br>But now, at home, with the arrest of Yuki&#x2019;s father, things had taken a new turn. It struck Yuki that he was going to have to provide for his family. Maybe he would have to drop out of school. He glanced at his mother, saw how devastated she was. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t worry,&#x201d; he told her. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ll be all right. I&#x2019;ll keep the farm going.&#x201d; But Yuki knew the truth: Everything had changed, and nothing was going to be easy.<br> <br>Agent Carson carried out a lot of stuff: copies of the newspaper Father published, a ...</p><h2>Misty&#39;s Twilight</h2><p>Misty's Twilight is part thouroughbred, part Chinoteague pony, and one hundred percent fire and talent.

She was gathering up research for the trip she&#x2019;d planned ever since she was a ponytailed youngster in the sixth grade. That was the year she first read a book called Misty of Chincoteague, and the year one of her lifelong dreams had begun.<br> <br>Sandy piled the breakfast nook table with a rainbow of color. The kitchen calendar topped the display, with a lively parade of ponies, wild and tame. Three glasses of freshly poured orange juice paled by comparison.<br> <br>Thrilled with her production, Sandy stood back a moment to admire it. She was interrupted by two sleepy-eyed children who came yawning into the room. Sandy announced the electrifying news: &#x201c;All aboard for Chincoteague! What a glamorous way to spend your birthdays!&#x201d; She picked up the calendar and with a dramatic flourish tore off April, May, and June and pointed to the last week in July. Chris and Pam stared.<br> <br>Pam whispered, &#x201c;Mom&#x2019;s flipped.&#x201d; But nothing could stop Sandy now. She circled the last week of July in red ink and called out:<br> <br>&#x201c;July 23 - Two birthdays and Departure Day, northward bound from Ocala, Florida, to Chincoteague, Virginia.<br> <br>July 24 - Still heading north.<br> <br>July 25 - Arrive Chincoteague Island.<br> <br>July 26 - Scouting neighboring Assateague for wild ponies.<br> <br>July 27 - The roundup and the swim across the channel.<br> <br>July 28 - The auction.&#x201d;<br> <br>Both children studied their mother as if she were a teacher dictating weeks of assignments. &#x201c;Why, that&#x2019;s the middle of summer!&#x201d; Chris said.<br> <br>Sandy was deaf to the tone of his voice.

Among the seminal figures in linguistic theory over the past century, since the 1960s Chomsky has also secured a place as perhaps the leading dissident voice in the United States.<br><br>Chomsky&#x2019;s many bestselling works&#x2014;including <i>Manufacturing Consent</i>, <i>Hegemony or Survival</i>, <i>Understanding Power</i>, and <i>Failed States</i>&#x2014;have served as essential touchstones for dissidents, activists, scholars, and concerned citizens on subjects ranging from the media to human rights to intellectual freedom. In particular, Chomsky&#x2019;s scathing critiques of the U.S. wars in Vietnam, Central America, and the Middle East have furnished a widely accepted intellectual inspiration for antiwar movements over nearly four decades.<br><br><i>The Essential Chomsky</i> assembles the core of his most important writings, including excerpts from his most influential texts over the past forty years.

Though her death is ruled a suicide, veteran investigative journalist Scott McGrath suspects otherwise. As he probes the strange circumstances surrounding Ashley&#x2019;s life and death, McGrath comes face-to-face with the legacy of her father: the legendary, reclusive cult-horror-film director Stanislas Cordova&#x2014;a man who hasn&#x2019;t been seen in public for more than thirty years.<br> &nbsp;<br> For McGrath, another death connected to this seemingly cursed family dynasty seems more than just a coincidence. Though much has been written about Cordova&#x2019;s dark and unsettling films, very little is known about the man himself.<br> &nbsp;<br> Driven by revenge, curiosity, and a need for the truth, McGrath, with the aid of two strangers, is drawn deeper and deeper into Cordova&#x2019;s eerie, hypnotic world.<br> &nbsp;<br> The last time he got close to exposing the director, McGrath lost his marriage and his career.

What&#x2019;s surprising about her elaborately plotted and addictive new novel is how it gets better as it grows more convoluted. I can envision a massive white board busy with diagrams and arrows to track the spider-webbed storyline. Once Pessl works past a few slow spots and finds her momentum, the story churns into a dark, propulsive, and insatiable mystery. The daughter of a reclusive horror film director is found dead, and a disgraced journalist and two sidekicks become obsessed with uncovering the truth of her death and the true identity of her infamous father, whose terrifying films (banned from theaters and found only via underground methods) depict what is &#x201c;graphic and dark and gorgeous about life, thereby conquering the monsters of your mind.&#x201d; Complex, shadowy, and a bit sad, Pessl&#x2019;s riveting tale keeps us guessing until the final pages, along the way raising questions about reality, magic, art, fear, and celebrity. Sprinkled throughout are clever page props<em>--</em>website screenshots, news clippings, smudged police reports, and coffee-stained transcripts. It all holds together impressively, with a satisfying payoff that&#x2019;ll leave you spent and sorry the ride is over. Special note to impatient readers (like me): stick with it, and savor it.

By unlocking the secrets of the hidden language of dogs, psychologist Stanley Coren allows us into the doggy dialogue, or &#x201c;Doggish,&#x201d; and makes effective communication a reality.<br> <br>Drawing on substantial research in animal behavior, evolutionary biology, and years of personal experience, Coren demonstrates that the average house dog can understand language at about the level of a two-year-old human. While actual conversation of the sort Lassie seemed capable of in Hollywood mythmaking remains forever out of reach, Coren shows us that a great deal of real communication is possible beyond the giving and obeying of commands.<br> <br><i>How to Speak Dog</i> not only provides the sounds, words, actions, and movements with which we can effectively communicate with our dogs, but also deciphers the signs that our dogs give to us. With easy-to-follow tips on how humans can mimic the language dogs use to talk with one another, original drawings illustrating the subtleties of their body language, and a handy visual glossary and &#x201c;Doggish&#x201d; phrasebook, <i>How to Speak Dog</i> gives dog lovers the skills they need to improve their relationships with their pets.</p><p>An invaluable language manual for people who need to communicate with dogs, <i>How to Speak Dog</i> is far more than a simple training guide. Author Stanley Coren discusses at length the evolution of language in many species, and focuses as much on body language as he does on verbal communication. This is a man with his own theories on language development--when disagreeing with Chomsky or Darwin, he backs up his arguments with plenty of thorough, firsthand experience. <p> Separate chapters devoted exclusively to interpreting the movement of tails, ears, and bodies are fascinating, and can often provide surprisingly quick insight into canine behavior. There's a tremendous difference between showing affection and showing dominance, and humans have a strong tendency to misread our dogs' behavior and reward them in exactly the right way to ensure the continuation of frustrating behavior. Coren maintains that dogs can often learn far more words than we give them credit for--certainly, we've all seen pooches go bananas at the words <i>walk</i> and <i>cookie</i>, but he also suggests we watch for learned behaviors from certain words. Perhaps <i>office</i> gets your spaniel waiting by the door, or <i>baby</i> results in your terrier checking in on your child's location--you may just think it's cute, but actually, it's a sign of your dog's linguistic ability. </p><p> Whether you own a dog or two or work in the field of animal care, this manual will be a most informative read and is sure to have a positive effect on the relationship between you and man's best friend. <i>--Jill Lightner</i></p><b>Stanley Coren</b> an international authority on sidedness, is professor of psychology at the University of British Columbia.

As educated, middle-class Latino immigrants in a region that was defined by segregation, the Quinteros occupied a privileged vantage from which to view the racially charged culture they inhabited. Weaver and her family were firsthand witnesses to key moments in the civil rights movement.&nbsp; But <i>Darkroom</i> is her personal story as well: chronicling what it was like being a Latina girl in the Jim Crow South, struggling to understand both a foreign country and the horrors of our nation&#x2019;s race relations.

Many&nbsp;cultures share an understanding of Earth as a feminine force as well as the planet we call home.&nbsp;Referred to as Gaia, Shakti, Mother Earth, or Pachamama, Earth is definitely feminine. She&nbsp; is us&nbsp;and we are her. If this seems problematic or cosmically strange to you, buckle up for a wild ride!<br><br>Forest bathing is a process of rewilding, simultaneously the most natural and the hardest thing.&nbsp;It&#x2019;s a stomping out of all our learned behaviors so we can reacquaint with our true selves and, with that, the web that comprises every&nbsp;living thing. Everywhere, forests are vying for our attention. They desire to be seen and noticed&nbsp;and will do everything in their power to get us to slow down and wake up to life. Forests and trees&nbsp;call to all of us; they need our help as much as we need theirs. We can save one another. That&nbsp;longing in your heart to go to the forest is real.<br>You may start with a trip to a forest, but true forest bathing extends into rituals and practices&nbsp;that you will eventually incorporate into your everyday life. A forest bath is not a &#x201c;one and done&#x201d;&nbsp;kind of experience. And there&#x2019;s no right or wrong way to forest bathe; it&#x2019;s a personal experience&nbsp;in which each of us finds what works best.<br><br>Begin with the intention of reconnecting to Nature and the realiza- tion that you&#x2019;re separated from&nbsp;the source; the life you desire for yourself is on the other side of the separation. In the&nbsp;process, you&#x2019;ll relearn some of the basic tenets of being a human&#x2014;like how to walk, how to breathe,&nbsp;how to open your heart, and how to be truly present.<br><br>No two forest baths are the same. When you go into the forest, you may get the forest bath you need&nbsp;instead of the one you want. Forest bathing involves no specific time requirements. On some days,&nbsp;you may have time to spend a few hours immersed in nature. Other days, you may only have a few&nbsp;sacred moments to connect. You can forest bathe time and again, and each visit will be different.&nbsp;There are infinite activations and ways to connect&#x2014;you&#x2019;ll discover what works best for you. Trust&nbsp;that the forest is working alongside you to design<br>the perfect experience.</p><h2>Family Systems and Congregational Life: A Map for Ministry</h2><p>Experienced pastor and seminary teacher R.&nbsp;Robert Creech helps pastoral leaders increase their effectiveness by applying family systems theory to congregational life and ministry. Creech introduces readers to the basic concepts of Bowen Family Systems Theory, applies family theory to the work of ministry in church settings, and connects systems thinking to the everyday aspects of congregational ministry, such as preaching, pastoral care, leadership, spiritual formation, and interpreting biblical texts. Each chapter contains discussion questions, and there are five helpful appendixes with supplemental information about Bowen theory.</p><p>"This scholarly yet personal integration of Bowen Family Systems Theory into life and ministry can engage readers in their own versions of working on differentiation of self. Applying this approach promises to bring change for the better in a family or congregation--even in the larger community. Creech illustrates and inspires that effort."<br>--<b>Victoria Harrison</b>, Center for the Study of Natural Systems and the Family (www.csnsf.org) and Bowen Center for the Study of the Family (www.thebowencenter.org)<br><br>"Robert Creech has provided a fresh approach to pastoral ministry, no matter the size of the congregation. The study of Bowen Family Systems Theory has changed my approach to life and ministry over the last sixteen years, and <i>Family Systems and Congregational Life</i> will benefit me and my communities of faith as I continue to digest this well-written text abounding with Creech's fresh insights. Those who are just learning about the theory, as well as seasoned advocates doing the hard yet rewarding work of living out these principles, will find refreshment and encouragement in these pages for the sometimes challenging work of ministry."<br>--<b>Becky&nbsp;L. Towne</b>, Houston Graduate School of Theology<br><br>"Creech makes a tremendous contribution to understanding Bowen Family Systems Theory, pastoral theology, and the practice of ministry. Using the adage 'always take a map,' he makes a case for the application of emotional process thinking in every aspect of ministry. The appendixes are pure gold. This book is a must for those who wish to effectively face challenges within their families, faith communities, and the wider world."<br>--<b>Emlyn&nbsp;A. Ott</b>, executive director and CEO, Healthy Congregations, Inc.; Bexley Seabury Seminary<br><br>"Creech offers a map for the practice of ministry. This book will make the challenges a little easier: leadership, exegesis and preaching, visioning and pastoral care. Leaders are also encouraged to attend to their own emotional and spiritual growth. Most of the chapters are by themselves worth the price of the book. It is clear and practical, while also well grounded theologically and theoretically.

Ira Levin's second novel (he went on to write such fine thrillers as <i>A Kiss Before Dying</i>, <i>The Stepford Wives</i>, and <i>The Boys from Brazil</i>), <i>Rosemary's Baby</i>, remains perhaps his best work. The author's mainstream "this is how it really happened" style undeniably also made the novel his most widely imitated. The plot line is deceptively simple: What if you were a happily married young woman, living in New York, and one day you awoke to find yourself pregnant? And what if your loving husband had--apparently--sold your soul to Satan? And now you were beginning to believe that your unborn child was, in reality, the son of Satan? Levin subtly makes it all totally plausible, unless of course, dear Rosemary--or the reader--can no longer distinguish fantasy from reality! A wonderfully chilling novel, it was later faithfully transformed into an equally unnerving motion picture. In 1997, a sequel was spawned, <i>Son of Rosemary</i>. <i>--Stanley Wiater</i><p><strong>Ira Levin</strong> is the author of <em>The Boys from Brazil</em>, <em>Rosemary&#x2019;s Baby, Son of Rosemary, The Stepford Wives</em>, <em>This Perfect Day</em>, <em>Sliver</em>, and <em>A Kiss Before Dying</em> (for which he won the Edgar Award).

Just about everyone has heard of Esperanto, which was nothing less than one man&#x2019;s attempt to bring about world peace by means of linguistic solidarity. And every Star Trek fan knows about Klingon. But few people have heard of Babm, Blissymbolics, Loglan (not to be confused with Lojban), and the nearly nine hundred other invented languages that represent the hard work, high hopes, and full-blown delusions of so many misguided souls over the centuries. With intelligence and humor, Arika Okrent has written a truly original and enlightening book for all word freaks, grammar geeks, and plain old language lovers.<br>&nbsp;<br></p><p>Arika Okrent received a joint Ph.D. in the Department of Linguistics and the Department of Psychology&#x2019;s Cognition and Cognitive Neuroscience Program at the University of Chicago. She has also earned her first-level certification in Klingon. She lives in Philadelphia.One<br> Scaring the Mundanes<br> &nbsp;<br> Klingon speakers, those who have devoted themselves to the study of a language invented for the <i>Star Trek</i> franchise, inhabit the lowest possible rung on the geek ladder. Dungeons &amp; Dragons players, ham radio operators, robot engineers, computer programmers, comic book collectors&#x2014;they all look down on Klingon speakers. Even the most ardent <i>Star Trek</i> fanatics, the Trekkies, who dress up in costume every day, who can recite scripts of entire episodes, who collect <i>Star Trek</i> paraphernalia with mad devotion, consider Klingon speakers beneath them. When a discussion of Klingon appeared on Slashdot.org&#x2014;the Web site billed as &#x201c;News for Nerds&#x201d;&#x2014;the topic inspired comments like &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry but it&#x2019;s people like this that give science fiction a bad name.&#x201d; Another said that Klingon speakers &#x201c;provide excellent reasons for forced sterilization. Then again being able to speak Klingon pretty much does this without surgery.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Mark Shoulson, who has a wife and two children, doesn&#x2019;t enjoy being talked about this way. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s okay to laugh about it, because it&#x2019;s funny. It&#x2019;s legitimate to laugh. Klingon has entertainment as part of its face value. But I do get annoyed at some of the ruder stuff.&#x201d; Mark was my unoffi cial guide to the world of Kling on. When I met him, we lived in the same New Jersey town. I discovered this browsing the Internet, where I also found that he was assistant director of the Klingon Language Institute (KLI) and editor of the Klingon translation of <i>Hamlet</i>. I wrote him, and he e- mailed me back the same day, saying he was so excited by the prospect of another Klingon speaker so close by that he didn&#x2019;t even fi nish reading my message before he responded.<br> &nbsp;<br> I wasn&#x2019;t yet a Klingon speaker, and I wasn&#x2019;t really planning on becoming one. I was a linguist who had developed a side interest in the subject of artifi cial languages, and I wanted to talk to Mark for research purposes. People really spoke Klingon&#x2014;so claimed the Klingon Language Institute materials anyway&#x2014;and I wasn&#x2019;t sure what that meant. When people &#x201c;spoke&#x201d; Klingon, was it playacting? Spitting out little words and phrases and putting on a show? A charades- like guessing game where someone sort of cobbled together a message and someone else sort of understood it? Or was it actual language use?<br> &nbsp;<br> If it was the latter, then this was something I needed to see for myself, because that would make Klingon something so remarkable as to be almost unheard of&#x2014;a consciously invented language that had been brought to life.<br> &nbsp;<br> Although we like to call language mankind&#x2019;s greatest invention, it wasn&#x2019;t invented at all. The languages we speak were not created according to any plan or design. Who invented French? Who invented Portuguese? No one. They just happened. They arose. Someone said something a certain way, someone else picked up on it, and someone else embellished. A tendency turned into a habit, and somewhere along the way a system came to be. This is how pidgins, slangs, and dialects are born; this is the way English, Russian, and Japanese were born. This is the way all natural languages are born&#x2014;organically, spontaneously.<br> &nbsp;<br> The variety of shape, pattern, and color found in the languages of the world is a testament to the wonder of nature, to the breathtaking array of possibilities that can emerge, tangled and wild, from the fertile human endowments of brain and larynx, intelligence and social skills. The job of the linguist, like that of the biologist or the botanist, is not to tell us how nature should behave, or what its creations should look like, but to describe those creations in all their messy glory and try to fi gure out what they can teach us about life, the world, and, especially in the case of linguistics, the workings of the human mind.<br> &nbsp;<br> In libraries organized according to the Library of Congress call number system, linguists can usually be found in the stacks classifi ed in the fi rst half of the Ps, anywhere from subclass P, which covers general linguistics, to subclass PN, where &#x201c;literature&#x201d; starts. When I was in graduate school, I used to wander this territory, in a procrastinatory haze, noting how the languages covered by the intervening categories became more and more &#x201c;exotic&#x201d; the farther I got from PA (Greek and Latin). I would fi rst pass through aisles and aisles of Romance languages, then Germanic, Scandinavian, English, Slavic. There at the end of the Slavic section, at PG9501, things would start to get interesting, with Albanian, followed by the offerings of PH&#x2014;the Finno- Ugrics (Veps, Estonian, Udmurt, Hungarian), the mysterious Basque. By the time I got to PL, I would be far from Europe, drifting through Asia and Africa, lingering over <i>A Grammar of the Hoava Language</i>, <i>Western Solomons</i> or <i>The Southern Bauchi Group of Chadic Languages: A Survey Report</i>.<br> &nbsp;<br> The final subclass, PM, was a tour through the New World, starting with the Eskimo languages of Greenland and Alaska and proceeding southward through Tlingit, Kickapoo, and Navajo to the Mayan and Aztecan languages of Mexico and Central America, down across the Amazon, through the Andes and the plains of Brazil, until I reached the islands off the southernmost tip of South America with <i>Yï¿½mana- English: A Dictionary of the Speech of Tierra del Fuego</i>. From there, there was nowhere to go but to the borders of language itself&#x2014;the contact, or &#x201c;mixed,&#x201d; languages, the pidgins and creoles of the PM7800s: <i>Spanish Contact Vernaculars in the Philippine Islands</i>; <i>Le crï¿½ole de Breaux Bridge</i>, <i>Louisiane: ï¿½tude morphosyntaxique, textes, vocabulaire.</i><br> <i>&nbsp;</i><br> At the very end of this lush orchid garden of languages there was one more section, where linguists don&#x2019;t generally care to visit&#x2014;a few lonely shelves of faded plastic fl owers, the artifi cial languages. <i>The Klingon Dictionary</i> was here, among other books on languages I had never heard of: Babm, aUI, Nal Bino, Leno GiNasu, Tutonish, Ehmay Ghee Chah. These were not lighthearted language games, like pig Latin, or the spontaneous results of ingroup communication, like Cockney rhyming slang or surfer jargon. They were invented on purpose, cut from whole cloth, set down on paper, start to fi nish, by one person. They had chapters and chapters of grammar and extensive dictionaries. They were testaments not to the wonder of nature but to the human impulse to master nature. They were deliberate, painstakingly crafted attempts to tame language by making it more orderly, more rational, less burdened with inconsistencies and irregularities. There were hundreds of them. And they were all failures, dead in the water, spoken by no one.<br> &nbsp;<br> Well, of course they were. If you plant a plastic flower, will it grow? So I was skeptical about the claims that Klingon&#x2014;Klingon?&#x2014; had really defied the odds and sprouted roots. In the name of research, I registered for the annual Klingon conference, or qep&#x2019;a&#x2019;, to occur in Phoenix at the end of the summer. I wanted to be prepared, and so I arranged to meet with Mark.<br> &nbsp;<br> For our fi rst meeting Mark showed up in a T- shirt with the International Phonetic Alphabet printed on it, and I soon discovered that all his T- shirts were a form of self- expression. In fact, everything he owns somehow advertises his interests to the world. On his minivan he has a KLI license plate holder and an LNX sticker (proclaiming himself a user of the Linux operating system). On the vest he wears most days, he displays his three Klingon certification pins; membership pins for the Dozenal Society (&#x201c;they advocate switching to a base 12 system from the base 10 system we use for numbering&#x201d;), Mensa (&#x201c;it&#x2019;s a way for insecure people to feel better about themselves&#x201d;), and the Triple Nine Society (&#x201c;a more extreme kind of Mensa&#x201d;); and a button he made that says &#x201c;If you can read this you are standing too close&#x201d; in Braille.<br> &nbsp;<br> I usually met with Mark at a kosher pizza place. He&#x2019;s an Orthodox Jew who follows all the rules, but jokes that he would be an atheist &#x201c;if I weren&#x2019;t such a scaredy- cat.&#x201d; He is slender and jittery, one knee constantly bouncing as he talks in a speedy patter. His eyes convey both friendliness and sadness, as if he hopes you will like him but wouldn&#x2019;t be surprised if you punched him. He never finished his Ph.D. in computer science, and he has had trouble holding down a job, to which he credits his attention deficit disorder (&#x201c;It&#x2019;s not an excuse; it&#x2019;s an explanation&#x201d;). He cares for his children while his wife, a physician, works, and he teaches computer programming part- time at a yeshiva in Newark. While many bright people like Mark tend to blame the world for not rewarding them more heartily for their smarts, he accepts his own responsibility in the matter. He knows a lot, but not much of it is career making. He is, as he might put it, a polymath of esoterica. His other interests include knot making, typography, mathematical knitting, and calendrical systems. We flew to Phoenix together, and when the plane took off, he pulled a book out of his duffel bag titled <i>Science from Your Airplane Window</i>.<br> &nbsp;<br><br> &nbsp;</p><h2>Star Wars X-Wing: The Krytos Trap, Book 3</h2><p>The Rebels have taken the Imperial headquarters world of Coruscant, but their problems are far from over.

Stackpole lives in Arizona with Liz Danforth and a small pack of Cardigan Welsh corgis.High up in a tower suite, up above the surface of Imperial Center, Kirtan Loor allowed himself a smile. At the tower's pinnacle, the only companions were hawk-bats safe in their shadowed roosts and Special Intelligence operatives who were menacing despite their lack of stormtrooper armor or bulk. He felt alone and aloof, but those sensations came naturally with his sense of superiority. At the top of the world, he had been given all he could see to command and dominate.<br><br> <i>And destroy.</i><br><br> Ysanne Isard had given him the job of creating and leading a Palpatine Counter-insurgency Front. He knew she did not expect grand success from him. He had been given ample resources to make himself a nuisance. He could disrupt the functioning of the New Republic. He could slow their takeover of Coruscant and hamper their ability to master the mechanisms of galactic administration. A bother, minor but vexatious, is what Ysanne Isard had intended he become.<br><br> Kirtan Loor knew he had to become more. Years before, when he started working as an Imperial liaison officer with the Corellian Security Force on Corellia, he never would have dreamed of finding himself rising so far and playing so deadly a game. Even so, he had always been ambitious, and supremely confident in himself and his abilities. His chief asset was his memory, which allowed him to recall a plethora of facts, no matter how obscure. Once he had seen or read or heard something he could draw it from his memory, and this ability gave him a gross advantage over the criminals and bureaucrats with whom he dealt.<br><br> His reliance on his memory had also hobbled him. His prodigious feats of recall so overawed his enemies that they would naturally assume he had processed the information he possessed and had drawn the logical conclusions from it. Since they assumed he already knew what only they knew, they would tell him what he had not bothered to figure out for himself. They made it unnecessary for him to truly think, and that skill had begun to atrophy in him.<br><br> Ysanne Isard, when she summoned him to Imperial Center, had made it abundantly clear that learning to think and not to assume was the key to his continued existence. Her supervision made up in severity what it lacked in duration, putting him through a grueling regimen that rehabilitated his cognitive abilities. By the time she fled Imperial Center, Isard had clearly been confident in his ability to annoy and confound the Rebels.<br><br> More importantly, Kirtan Loor had become certain that he could do all she wanted and yet more.<br><br> From his vantage point he looked down on the distant blob of dignitaries and mourners gathered at the memorial for Corran Horn. While he despised them all for their politics, he joined them in mourning Horn's loss. Corran Horn had been Loor's nemesis. They had hated each other on Corellia, and Loor had spent a year and a half trying to hunt Corran down after he fled from Corellia. The hunt had ended when Ysanne Isard brought Loor to Imperial Center, but he had anticipated a renewal of his private little war with Horn when given the assignment to remain on Coruscant.<br><br> Of course, Corran's demise hardly made a dent in the legion of enemies Loor had on Imperial Center. Foremost among them was General Airen Cracken, the director of Alliance Intelligence. Cracken's network of spies and operatives had ultimately made the conquest of the Imperial capital possible, and his security precautions had given Imperial counterintelligence agents fits for years. Cracken--or Kraken, as some of Loor's people had taken to calling the Rebel--would be a difficult foe with whom to grapple.<br><br> Loor knew he had some other enemies who would pursue him as part of a personal vendetta. The whole of Rogue Squadron, from Antilles to the new recruits, would gladly hunt him down and kill him--including the spy in their midst since Loor presented a security risk for the spy. Even if they could not connect him with Corran's death directly, the mere fact that Corran hated him would be a burden they'd gladly accept and a debt they would attempt to discharge.<br><br> Della Wessiri was the last of the CorSec personnel Loor had hunted, and her presence on Imperial Center gave him pause. She had never been as relentless as Corran Horn in her pursuit of criminals, but that had always seemed to Loor to be because she was more thorough than Horn. Whereas Corran might muscle his way through an investigation, Della picked up on small clues and accomplished with ï¿½lan what Corran did with brute strength. In the shadow game in which Loor was engaged, this meant she was a foe he might not see coming, and that made her the most dangerous of all.<br><br> Loor backed away from the window and looked at the holographic representation of the figures below as they strode across his holotable. The ceremony had been broadcast planetwide, and would be rebroadcast at various worlds throughout the galaxy. He watched Borsk Fey'lya and Wedge Antilles as they met in close conversation, then split apart and wandered away. Everyone appeared more like toys to him than they did real people. He found it easy to imagine himself a titanic--no, <i>Imperial</i>--presence who had deigned to be distracted by the actions of bugs.<br><br> He picked up the remote device from the table and flicked it on. A couple of small lights flashed on the black rectangle in his left palm, then a red button in the center of it glowed almost benignly. His thumb hovered over it for a second. He smiled, but killed the impulse to stab his thumb down and gently returned the device to the table.<br><br> A year before he would have punched that button, detonating the explosives his people had secreted around the memorial. With one casual caress he could have unleashed fire and pain, wiping out a cadre of traitorous planetary officials and eliminating Rogue Squadron. He knew, given a chance, any of the SI operatives under his command <i>would</i> have triggered the nergon 14 charges--as would the majority of the military command staff still serving the Empire.<br><br> Loor did not. Isard had pointed out on numerous occasions that before the Empire could be reestablished, the Rebellion had to die. She had pointed out that the Emperor's obsession with destroying the Jedi Knights had caused him to regard the rest of the Rebellion as a lesser threat, yet it had outlived the Jedi <i>and</i> the Emperor. Only by destroying the Rebellion would it be possible to reassert the Empire's authority over the galaxy. Destroying the Rebellion required methods more subtle than exploding grandstands and planets, accomplishing with a vibroblade what could not be done with a Death Star.</p><h2>The Rogue Crew: A Tale fom Redwall</h2><p>Redwall Abbey has never seen a creature more evil or more hideous than Razzid Wearat.

Yet it is all too true. With the publication of his first children's book in 1987, the award-winning <b>Redwall</b>, Jacques' fresh talent has received exceptional praise from reviewers in the United States and England. Newbery Award winner Lloyd Alexander called it "a fine work, literate, witty, filled with the excitement of genuine storytelling. Young people will surely be captivated. I hope they give their elders a chance to share the delights."<p>A well-known radio personality in his native Liverpool--as well as an actor, stand-up comic, and playwright--Brian Jacques is the host of "Jakestown" on BBC Radio Merseyside. Ever the performer, Jacques is well-known for applying his acting and entertainment background to his lively presentations to legions of young fans at schools across the United States and England.</p><p><b>Brian Jacques</b> was born in Liverpool, England on June 15th, 1939. Along with forty percent of the population of Liverpool, his ancestral roots are in Ireland, County Cork to be exact.</p><p>He grew up in the area around the Liverpool docks. His interest in adventure stories began at an early age with reading the books of: Daniel Defoe, Sir Henry Rider Haggard, Arthur Conan Doyle, Sir Thomas Malory, Robert Michael Ballantyne, Robert Louis Stevenson, Edgar Rice Burroughs, and Kenneth Grahame. He attended St. John's School, an inner city school that had its playground on the roof. On his first day at St. John's, at the age of ten, he had an experience that marked his potential as a writer. When given an assignment of writing a story about animals, he wrote about the bird that cleaned a crocodile's teeth. The teacher could not, and would not, believe that a ten year old could write that well. When young Brian refused to falsely say that he had copied the story, he was caned as "a liar". He had always loved to write, but it was only then, that he realized that he had a talent for writing.</p><p>Some teachers at St. John's proved to be good role models. As Mr. Jacques recalls:</p><p>"My favourite teacher was Mr. Austin Thomas. He looked like Lee Marvin. Big Man. A Captain in World War II. He came to school on a big bush bike with the haversack on back. He was a man's man. Always fair. I was fourteen at the time when Mr. Thomas introduced the class to poetry and Greek literature. (Because of him, I saved seven shillings and sixpence to buy <b>The Iliad</b> and <b>The Odyssey</b> at this dusty used book shop.)"</p><p>This interest in poetry extended to Wordsworth, Tennyson, and Goldsmith.It was also at St. John's that Brian met a teacher, Alan Durband (who also taught two Beatles, Paul McCartney and George Harrison), who, more than thirty years later would bring about a major change in his life.</p><p>After Brian finished school at fifteen, he set out to find adventure as a merchant seaman. He travelled to many far away ports, including New York, Valparaiso, San Francisco, and Yokohama. Tiring of the lonely life of a sailor, he returned to Liverpool where he worked as a railway fireman, a longshoreman, a long-distance truck driver, a bus driver, a boxer, a bobby (Police Constable 216D), a postmaster, and a stand-up comic.</p><p> </p><p><b>Penguin mourns the passing of celebrated children&#x2019;s book author Brian Jacques</b></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>"For satisfying swashbuckling, this Redwall saga delivers, with a ride-into-the-sunset conclusion."--<i>The Horn Book<br><br></i>"All of the late Jacques&#x2019; signature elements are here . . .

He&#x2019;d awoken early in the Palazzo Vecchio penthouse of the Gallery Hotel Art and ordered room service, but he couldn&#x2019;t resist returning to bed to watch the young woman sleep. She was on her side facing him, breathing softly, a diamond sparkling on her ear. Her cheeks were pink from the warmth of the room as their bed was bathed in sunshine from the floor-to-ceiling windows.</p><p>The bed covers were deliciously rumpled, smelling of sex and sandalwood. His blue eyes glimmered, traveling lazily over her exposed skin and long, dark hair. As he turned back to his newspaper, she shifted slightly and moaned. Concerned, he tossed the paper aside.</p><p>She brought her knees up to her chest, curling into a ball. Low murmurings came from her lips, and Gabriel leaned closer so he could decipher what she was saying. But he couldn&#x2019;t.</p><p>All of a sudden, her body twisted and she let out a heart-wrenching cry. Her arms flailed as she wrestled with the sheet that shrouded her.</p><p>&#x201c;Julianne?&#x201d; He placed a gentle hand on her bare shoulder, but she cringed away from him.</p><p>She began muttering his name, over and over again, her tone growing progressively more panicked.</p><p>&#x201c;Julia, I&#x2019;m here,&#x201d; he raised his voice. Just as he reached for her again, she sat bolt upright, gasping for air.</p><p>&#x201c;Are you all right?&#x201d; Gabriel moved closer, resisting the urge to touch her. She was breathing roughly, and under his watchful gaze, she fanned a shaking hand over her eyes.</p><p>&#x201c;Julia?&#x201d;</p><p>After a long, tense minute, she looked at him, eyes wide.</p><p>He frowned. &#x201c;What happened?&#x201d;</p><p>She swallowed loudly. &#x201c;A nightmare.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What was it about?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I was in the woods behind your parents&#x2019; house, back in Selinsgrove.&#x201d;</p><p>Gabriel&#x2019;s eyebrows knit together behind his dark-rimmed glasses. &#x201c;Why would you dream about that?&#x201d;</p><p>She inhaled, drawing the sheet over her exposed breasts and up to her chin. The linen was full and white, swallowing her petite frame whole before billowing cloudlike over the mattress. She reminded him of an Athenian statue.</p><p>He ran his fingers gently over her skin. &#x201c;Julianne, talk to me.&#x201d;</p><p>She squirmed under his piercing blue eyes, but he would not let her go. &#x201c;The dream began beautifully. We made love under the stars, and I fell asleep in your arms. When I woke up you were gone.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You dreamed I made love to you, then abandoned you?&#x201d; His tone cooled to mask his discomfort.</p><p>&#x201c;I woke up in the orchard without you once,&#x201d; she reproached him softly.</p><p>The fire in his belly was instantly quenched. He thought back to the magical evening six years ago when they first met, when they simply talked and held each other. He&#x2019;d awoken the following morning and wandered away, leaving a sleeping teenage girl all alone. Surely her anxiety was understandable if not pitiable.</p><p>He unwound her clenched fingers one by one and kissed them repentantly. &#x201c;I love you, Beatrice. I&#x2019;m not going to leave you. You know that, right?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It would hurt so much more to lose you now.&#x201d;</p><p>With a frown he wrapped an arm around her shoulder, pressing her cheek to his chest. A myriad of memories crowded his mind as he thought back to what had transpired the evening before. He&#x2019;d gazed on her naked form for the first time and initiated her into the intimacies of lovemaking. She&#x2019;d shared her innocence with him, and he thought he&#x2019;d made her happy. Certainly it had been one of the best evenings of his life. He pondered that fact for a moment.</p><p>&#x201c;Do you regret last night?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No. I&#x2019;m glad you were my first. It&#x2019;s what I wanted since we met.&#x201d;</p><p>He placed his hand on her cheek, tracing her skin with his thumb. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m honored to have been your first.&#x201d; He leaned forward, his eyes unblinking. &#x201c;But I want to be your last.&#x201d;</p><p>She smiled and lifted her lips to meet his. Before he could embrace her, the chimes of Big Ben filled the room.</p><p>&#x201c;Ignore it,&#x201d; he whispered fiercely, his arm stretching across her body, pushing her to recline beneath him.</p><p>Her eyes darted over his shoulder to where his iPhone lay on the desk. &#x201c;I thought she wasn&#x2019;t going to call you anymore.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not answering, so it doesn&#x2019;t matter.&#x201d; He kneeled between her legs and lifted the sheet from her body. &#x201c;In my bed, there&#x2019;s only us.&#x201d;</p><p>She searched his eyes as he began to bring their naked bodies into closer contact.</p><p>Gabriel leaned forward to kiss her, but she turned her head. &#x201c;I haven&#x2019;t brushed my teeth.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t care.&#x201d; He lowered his lips to her neck, kissing across her quickening pulse.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;d like to clean up first.&#x201d;</p><p>He huffed in frustration, leaning on one elbow. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t let Paulina ruin what we have.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not.&#x201d; She tried to roll out from under him and take the sheet with her, but he caught hold of it. He gazed over the rims of his glasses, his eyes sparkling with mischief.</p><p>&#x201c;I need the sheet to make the bed.&#x201d;</p><p>Her eyes traveled from the white fabric that was clutched between her fingers, to his face. He looked like a panther waiting to pounce. She glanced over the side of the bed at the pile of clothes on the floor. They were beyond her reach.</p><p>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s the problem?&#x201d; he asked, stifling a grin.</p><p>Julia blushed and gripped the material more tightly. With a chuckle, he released the sheet and pulled her into his arms.</p><p>&#x201c;You don&#x2019;t need to be shy. You&#x2019;re beautiful. If I had my wish, you&#x2019;d never wear clothes again.&#x201d;</p><p>He pressed his lips to her earlobe, gently touching the diamond stud. He was certain his adoptive mother, Grace, would have been happy that her earrings found their way to Julia. With another brief kiss, he turned away, sliding over to sit on the edge of the bed.</p><p>She slipped into the washroom but not before Gabriel caught sight of her alluring back as she dropped the sheet just outside the door.</p><p>While brushing her teeth, she thought about what had transpired. Making love with Gabriel had been a very emotional experience, and even now her heart felt the aftershocks. That wasn&#x2019;t surprising considering their history. She&#x2019;d wanted him since she spent a chaste night with him in an orchard when she was seventeen, but he&#x2019;d been gone when she awoke the next morning. He&#x2019;d forgotten her in the aftermath of a drunken, drug-induced haze. Six long years passed before she saw him again, and then, he didn&#x2019;t remember her.</p><p>When she encountered him again on the first day of his graduate seminar at the University of Toronto, he was attractive but cold, like a distant star. She hadn&#x2019;t believed then that she&#x2019;d become his lover. She hadn&#x2019;t believed it possible that the temperamental and arrogant Professor would reciprocate her affection.</p><p>There were so many things she hadn&#x2019;t known. Sex was a kind of knowledge, and now she knew the sting of sexual jealousy in a manner she&#x2019;d never experienced before. The mere idea of Gabriel doing what they&#x2019;d done with some other woman, and in his case many other women, made her heart ache.</p><p>She knew that Gabriel&#x2019;s trysts were different from what they&#x2019;d shared&#x2014;that they were assignations not brought about by love or affection. But he&#x2019;d undressed them, seen them naked, and entered their bodies. After being with him, how many of those women craved more? Paulina had. She and Gabriel had maintained contact over the years since they conceived and lost a child together.</p><p>Julia&#x2019;s new understanding of sex changed her view of his past and made her more sympathetic to Paulina&#x2019;s plight. And all the more guarded against losing Gabriel to her or to any other woman.</p><p>Julia gripped the edge of the vanity as a wave of insecurity washed over her. Gabriel loved her; she believed this. But he was also a gentleman and would never reveal that their union had left him wanting. And what of her own behavior? She&#x2019;d asked questions and talked when she expected that most lovers would have been silent. She&#x2019;d done very little to please him, and when she tried he&#x2019;d stopped her.</p><p>Her ex-boyfriend&#x2019;s words came screaming back at her, swirling in her mind with condemnation:</p><p>You&#x2019;re frigid.</p><p>You&#x2019;re going to be a lousy lay.</p><p>She turned away from the mirror as she contemplated what might happen if Gabriel was dissatisfied with her. The specter of sexual betrayal reared its maleficent head, bringing with it visions of finding Simon in bed with her roommate.</p><p>She straightened her shoulders. If she could persuade Gabriel to be patient and to teach her, then she was confident she could please him. He loved her. He would give her a chance. She was his as surely as if he&#x2019;d branded his name on her skin.</p><p>When she stepped into the bedroom she caught sight of him through the open door to the terrace. On her way, she was distracted by a beautiful vase of dark purple and paler, variegated irises sitting on top of the desk. Some lovers might have purchased long-stemmed red roses, but not Gabriel.</p><p>She opened the card that was nestled amongst the blossoms.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>My Dearest Julianne,<br> Thank you for your immeasurable gift.<br> The only thing I have of value is my heart.<br> It&#x2019;s yours,<br> Gabriel.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Julia reread the card twice, her heart swelling with love and relief. Gabriel&#x2019;s words didn&#x2019;t sound like they were penned by a man who was dissatisfied or frustrated. Whatever Julia&#x2019;s worries, Gabriel didn&#x2019;t seem to share them.</p><p>Gabriel was sunning himself on the futon, his glasses off, his chest gloriously exposed. With his muscular, six-foot-two frame, it was as if Apollo himself had deigned to visit her. Sensing her presence on the terrace, he opened his eyes and patted his lap. She joined him, and his arms enveloped her as he kissed her passionately.</p><p>&#x201c;Why, hello there,&#x201d; he murmured, brushing a stray tendril back from her face. He peered at her closely. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s wrong?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Nothing. Thank you for the flowers. They&#x2019;re beautiful.&#x201d;</p><p>He brushed his lips against hers. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re welcome. But you look troubled. Is it about Paulina?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m upset that she&#x2019;s calling you, but no.&#x201d; Julia&#x2019;s expression brightened. &#x201c;Thank you for your card. It said what I desperately wanted to hear.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m glad.&#x201d; He squeezed her more closely. &#x201c;Tell me what&#x2019;s bothering you.&#x201d;</p><p>She toyed with the belt to her bathrobe for a moment, until he took her hand in his. She looked at him. &#x201c;Was last night everything you&#x2019;d hoped for?&#x201d;</p><p>Gabriel exhaled sharply, for her question had taken him by surprise. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s a strange question.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I know it had to be different for you. I wasn&#x2019;t very...active.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Active? What are you talking about?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t do much to please you.&#x201d; She blushed.</p><p>He stroked the flushing skin lightly with the tip of his finger. &#x201c;You pleased me a great deal. I know you were nervous, but I enjoyed myself tremendously. We belong to one another now&#x2014;in every way. What else is troubling you?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I demanded that we switch positions when you would have preferred me on top.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You didn&#x2019;t demand, you asked. Frankly, Julianne, I&#x2019;d like to hear you demand things of me. I want to know that you want me as desperately as I want you.&#x201d; His expression relaxed, and he drew a circle or two around her breast. &#x201c;You dreamed about your first time being a certain way. I wanted to give that to you, but I was worried. What if you were uncomfortable? What if I wasn&#x2019;t careful enough? Last night was a first for me too.&#x201d;</p><p>He released her, pouring coffee and steamed milk from two separate carafes into a lattï¿½ bowl and spreading the tray of food between them on the banquette. There were pastries and fruit, toast and Nutella, boiled eggs and cheese, and several Baci Perugina Gabriel had bribed a hotel employee to run out and purchase along with the extravagant bouquet of irises from the Giardino dell&#x2019;Iris.</p><p>Julia unwrapped one of the Baci and ate it, eyes closed with pure pleasure. &#x201c;You ordered a feast.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I awoke ravenous this morning. I would have waited for you but...&#x201d; He shook his head as he picked up a grape and fixed her with a sparkling eye. &#x201c;Open.&#x201d;</p><p>She opened her mouth, and he popped the grape inside, tracing his finger temptingly across her lower lip.</p><p>&#x201c;And you must drink this, please.&#x201d; He handed her a wine glass filled with cranberry juice and soda.</p><p>She rolled her eyes. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re overprotective.&#x201d;</p><p>He shook his head. &#x201c;This is how a man behaves when he&#x2019;s in love and he wants his sweetheart healthy for all the sex he plans on having with her.&#x201d; He winked smugly.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not going to ask how you know about such things. Give me that.&#x201d; She grabbed the glass from his hand and downed it, her eyes focused on his, as he chuckled.</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re adorable.&#x201d;</p><p>She stuck her tongue out at him before fixing herself a breakfast plate.</p><p>&#x201c;How do you feel this morning?&#x201d; Gabriel&#x2019;s face grew concerned.</p><p>She swallowed a piece of Fontina cheese. &#x201c;Okay.&#x201d;</p><p>He pressed his lips together firmly, as if her answer displeased him.</p><p>&#x201c;Making love changes things between a man and a woman,&#x201d; he prompted.</p><p>&#x201c;Um, aren&#x2019;t you happy with, uh, what we did?&#x201d; The pink of her cheeks faded immediately, leaving her pale.</p><p>&#x201c;Of course I&#x2019;m happy. I&#x2019;m trying to find out if you&#x2019;re happy. And based upon what you&#x2019;ve said so far, I&#x2019;m worried that you aren&#x2019;t.&#x201d;</p><p>Julia picked at the fabric of her robe, avoiding Gabriel&#x2019;s probing gaze. &#x201c;When I was at college the girls on my floor would sit around and talk about their boyfriends. One night they told stories about their first times.&#x201d; She nibbled at the tip of one of her fingers.</p><p>&#x201c;Only a few of the girls had good things to say. The other stories were awful. One girl had been molested as a child. Some of the girls had been forced by a boyfriend or a date. Several of them said that their first times were completely awkward and unfulfilling&#x2014;a boyfriend grunting and finishing quickly. I thought, if that&#x2019;s all I can hope for, I&#x2019;d rather stay a virgin.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s horrible.&#x201d;</p><p>She fixed her eyes on the breakfast tray.</p><p>&#x201c;I wanted to be loved. I decided it would be better to have a chaste affair of the heart and mind through letters than a sexual relationship. I had my doubts that I would ever find anyone who could give me both. Certainly, Simon didn&#x2019;t love me. Now I&#x2019;m in a relationship with a sex god, and I can&#x2019;t give him anything like the pleasure he gives me.&#x201d;</p><p>Gabriel&#x2019;s eyebrows shot up. &#x201c;Sex god? You&#x2019;ve said that before, but believe me, I&#x2019;m not&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>She interrupted him, looking him straight in the eye. &#x201c;Teach me. I&#x2019;m sure last night was not as, um...fulfilling as it usually is for you, but I promise that if you are patient with me, I will improve.&#x201d;</p><p>He cursed obliquely. &#x201c;Come here.&#x201d; He pulled her around the breakfast tray and into his lap again, wrapping his arms around her. He was quiet for a moment, before sighing deeply.</p><p>&#x201c;You assume that my previous sexual encounters were completely fulfilling, but you&#x2019;re wrong. You gave me what I&#x2019;ve never had&#x2014;love and sex together. You&#x2019;re the only one who has ever been my lover in the true sense.&#x201d;</p><p>He kissed her gently in solemn confirmation of his words. &#x201c;The anticipation and the allure of a woman are crucial to the experience. I can safely say that your allurements and my anticipation were like nothing I&#x2019;ve ever experi...</p></p><h2>Spanish Stories / Cuentos Espaï¿½oles (A Dual-Language Book) (English and Spanish Edition)</h2><p><p>Designed for the lover of fine literature as well as the intermediate language student, this dual-language book contains 13 great, representative Spanish short stories.

You&#x2019;ll find a lot of practical, sane, biblical wisdom that will explode a number of our cultural assumptions about dating. If you are single or care about someone who is, you really should read this book. The result may just be a simpler, more God-honoring approach to dating than you thought possible.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Kevin DeYoung</strong><strong>,</strong> Senior Pastor,&nbsp;Christ Covenant Church, Matthews, North Carolina</p><p>&#x201c;In a world of cyber relationships&#x2015;fueled by Facebook, texts, and tweets&#x2015;the issues surrounding sex, dating, and relationships have become increasingly complex and challenging for teens, their friends, and their parents. This cutting-edge treatment of the rapidly changing scene is a must read for parents, students, counselors, and pastors. A big thanks to Gerald and Jay for helping us think sanely through this head-scratching cultural shift from a realistic and theologically astute perspective.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Joseph M. Stowell</strong><strong>,</strong> President, Cornerstone University, Grand Rapids, Michigan </p><p>&#x201c;Jay and Gerald have written a provocative book on one of the most pressing issues of our generation&#x2015;sexual purity. As the authors show, few things necessitate getting to the core of the gospel like our soul&#x2019;s craving for sexual fulfillment. We cannot think too carefully about what our heavenly Father has said. Even where I reach different conclusions from the authors, I am grateful for another investigation of the biblical data.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>J. D. Greear</strong><strong>,</strong> Pastor, The Summit Church, Raleigh-Durham, North Carolina; author, <em>Not God Enough</em> and <em>Stop Asking Jesus Into Your Heart</em></p><p>&#x201c;What a gift this book is to single men and women. Here, in brief space, is clear and closely reasoned advice that is ï¿½ber-biblical and Christ-centered. It flows with life-giving grace. <em>Sex, Dating, and Relationships</em> will be a landmark read for many in this generation.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>R. Kent Hughes</strong><strong>, </strong>Professor of Practical Theology, Westminster Theological Seminary</p><p>&#x201c;Simplicity is the strength of this fresh approach to sex, dating, and relationships. If at first you chafe at the idea of &#x2018;dating friendships,&#x2019; consider whether any alternative can bring greater glory to God, account for the biblical evidence, and guard against unnecessary heartache.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Collin Hansen</strong><strong>,</strong> Editorial Director, the Gospel Coalition; author, <em>Blind Spots</em></p><p>&#x201c;Hiestand and Thomas don&#x2019;t kiss dating goodbye; what fun would that be? Instead, dating is revealed for what it is, which might disturb you. The greatest strength of this book is the contribution the authors make toward thinking biblically about something not in the Bible, which isn&#x2019;t so easy to do. So it is possible that some might agree with their premises and the trajectory of their arguments, yet differ on some of the specific conclusions. But all will be challenged and blessed by their wise contributions to this vitally important issue.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Richard W. Hove</strong>, Campus Crusade for Christ, Duke University</p><p>&#x201c;How refreshing! Gerald and Jay have written a biblically based, gospel-oriented book on sex, dating, and relationships&#x2015;full of genuine, down-to-earth, practical instruction. This is exactly what Christians need to counteract the worldly attitudes and actions so prevalent in our churches today. It is imperative to think through these issues, and this is the best book I have read for doing so.

Coauthor with Michael Caduto of the bestselling Keepers of the Earth series, Bruchac&#39;s poems, articles and stories have appeared in hundreds of publications, from Akwesasne Notes and American Poetry Review to National Geographic and Parabola. He has authored many books for adults and children including Code Talker: A Novel About the Navajo Marines of World War Two, Skeleton Man, and The Heart of a Chief. For more information about Joseph, please visit his website www.josephbruchac.com.Grade 1-6?A companion to Bruchac's Thirteen Moons on Turtle's Back (Philomel, 1992). In that title, a grandfather shared the moon's legends with his grandson. In this book, a grandmother relates the legend of Sky Bear to her granddaughter. Sky Bear (also known as the Big Dipper) circles the Earth each night, and these 12 poems tell of what she sees and hears. Each one is from a different tribe: Mohawk, Anishinabe, Pima, Missisquoi, Winnebago, Cochiti Pueblo, Lenape, Chumash, Inuit, Lakota, Navajo, and Pawnee. Bruchac has once again compiled a thoughtful collection that eloquently bears out the theme of unity among all creatures. The selections display a wide range of emotions. Some are pensive meditations; others resound with hopeful energy. "Mouse's Bragging Song," a whimsical delight, is the arrogant boast of a little creature who thinks he alone can touch the sky. Locker's luminous oil paintings add detail and depth. They glow with brilliant sky colors: sunset reds, twilight purples. The Earth Under Sky Bear's Feet lives up to the high standards of Bruchac's earlier works, and is a worthy addition.?Marilyn Taniguchi, Santa Monica Public Library, CA<br>Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>10 Minutes till Bedtime</h2><p>Bedtime routines have never been so hilarious!<br><br>At One Hoppin' Place, the countdown to bedtime is about to begin when a family of hamsters arrives at the front door."All aboard!" the child's pet hamster, dressed as a tour guide, shouts, directing them to his bus. It's off to the kitchen for a snack, to the bathroom for toothbrushing, to the bedroom for a story. And just as the child begins to read, the tour guide looks out the window and shouts, "More coming!" Busloads and carloads of vacationing hamsters stream through the front door, ready to enjoy the escapades as the countdown continues.<br><br>A sure-fire toddler pleaser from the creator of <i>Good Night, Gorilla</i>.</p><p>"Ten minutes till bedtime!" Father announces from behind his newspaper. Out a picture window, his son and his son's pet hamster can see a hamster family (with kids numbered 1 to 10) approaching the house. "All aboard!" shouts the boy's prized pet, as his puzzled owner opens the door and the hamster tourists are loaded onto the special trolley. What the humans at 1 Hoppin Place don't know is that their cherished family pet has advertised on the Web (www.hamstertours.com) for a "10-Minute Bedtime Tour," and the hordes have only just begun to descend.<p> "Nine minutes till bedtime," Father insists, oblivious to the burgeoning hamster parade. At the 8-minute marker, the hamsters and the boy are in the kitchen for a pre-bedtime snack. One little guy is standing on top of a fruit bowl, lowering a cherry cluster with a string and paper clip. Hamster number 10 is trying to feed an animal cracker to the boy's fuzzy bedroom slipper. "Seven minutes till bedtime!" reminds Father as creative tooth-brushing progresses. But what's this? It's the 5-minute countdown marker, and the faint light of hamster headlights appears out the window. More tourists are on their way! Buses, trucks, taxis, and golf carts full of rodents are driving up the sidewalk! Hilarious hamster hijinks ensue. If you're not seeing the appeal here, it's like this: each spread is turbocharged with dozens of winsome, adorable details that will keep youngsters giggling and entranced--and counting to 10--time after time. Peggy Rathmann, author of the Caldecott Medal-winning <i>Officer Buckle and Gloria</i>, offers readers a rollicking rodent romp that ends with a goodnight kiss and many, many closed eyelids.

(Ages 2 to 8) <i>--Karin Snelson</i></p>Caldecott-medalist Peggy Rathmann was born in St. Paul, Minnesota, and grew up in the suburbs with two brothers and two sisters.<p>"In the summer we lolled in plastic wading pools guzzling Kool-Aid. In the winter we sculpted giant snow animals. It was a good life."</p><p>Ms. Rathmann graduated from Mounds View High School in New Brighton, Minnesota, then attended colleges everywhere, changing her major repeatedly. She eventually earned a B.A. in psychology from the University of Minnesota.</p><p>"I wanted to teach sign language to gorillas, but after taking a class in signing, I realized what I'd rather do was draw pictures of gorillas."</p><p>Ms. Rathmann studied commercial art at the American Academy in Chicago, fine art at the Atelier Lack in Minneapolis, and children's-book writing and illustration at the Otis Parsons School of Design in Los Angeles.</p><p>"I spent the first three weeks of my writing class at Otis Parsons filching characters from my classmates' stories. Finally, the teacher convinced me that even a beginning writer can create an original character if the character is driven by the writer's most secret weirdness. Eureka! A little girl with a passion for plagiarism! I didn't want anyone to know it was me, so I made the character look like my sister."</p><p>The resulting book, <b>Ruby the Copycat</b>, earned Ms. Rathmann the "Most Promising New Author" distinction in <i>Publishers Weekly</i>'s 1991 annual Cuffie Awards. In 1992 she illustrated <b>Bootsie Barker Bites</b> for Barbara Bottner, her teacher at Otis Parsons.</p><p>A homework assignment produced an almost wordless story, <b>Good Night, Gorilla</b>, inspired by a childhood memory.</p><p>"When I was little, the highlight of the summer was running barefoot through the grass, in the dark, screaming. We played kick-the-can, and three-times-around-the-house, and sometimes we just stood staring into other people's picture windows, wondering what it would be like to go home to someone else's house."</p><p>That story, however, was only nineteen pages long, and everyone agreed that the ending was a dud. Two years and ten endings later, <b>Good Night, Gorilla</b> was published and recognized as an ALA Notable Children's Book for 1994.</p><p>The recipient of the 1996 Caldecott Medal, <b>Officer Buckle and Gloria</b>, is the story of a school safety officer upstaged by his canine partner.</p><p>"We have a videotape of my mother chatting in the dining room while, unnoticed by her or the cameraman, the dog is licking every poached egg on the buffet. The next scene shows the whole family at the breakfast table, complimenting my mother on the delicious poached eggs. The dog, of course, is pretending not to know what a poached egg is. The first time we watched that tape we were so shocked, we couldn't stop laughing. I suspect that videotape had a big influence on my choice of subject matter."</p><p>Ms. Rathmann lives and works in San Francisco, in an apartment she shares with her husband, John Wick, and a very funny bunch of ants.</p><p>copyright ï¿½ 2000 by Penguin Putnam Books for Young Readers.

Homicide Detective Max Rupert never fully accepted his wife&#x2019;s death, even when he believed that a reckless hit-and-run driver was to blame. Haunted by memories both beautiful and painful, he is plagued by feelings of unfinished business. When Max learns that, in fact, Jenni was murdered, he must come to terms with this new information&#x2014;and determine what to do with it. Struggling to balance his impulses as a vengeful husband with his obligations as a law enforcement officer, Max devotes himself to relentlessly hunting down those responsible. For most of his life, he has thought of himself as a decent man. But now he&#x2019;s so consumed with anguish and thoughts of retribution that he finds himself on the edge, questioning who he is and what he stands for.

It is the only up-to-date survey of literary theory that devotes extensive treatment to queer studies, postcolonial and race studies, environmental criticism, and disability studies. <em>How to Interpret Literature</em> is ideal as a stand-alone text or in conjunction with an anthology of primary readings, like Robert Dale Parker's <em>Critical Theory: A Reader for Literary and Cultural Studies</em>.<br></p><p><br><strong>Robert Dale Parker </strong>is Frank Hodgins Professor of English at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.<br><br>"Parker's text is a model of clarity and lucidity, and its accessible examples make even the most difficult theoretical concepts easy to grasp. <em>How to Interpret Literature</em> is compulsively readable--not just a page-turner--but even fun to read.

He provides training both nationally and internationally in couple therapy, family therapy, brief therapy, and clinical supervision."A refreshingly practical insider's guide to the day-to-day work of family therapy. Taibbi opens his practice and invites us to experience the adventure of being a family therapist. He mentors the reader with wit and wisdom, creativity and conviction. Filled with fresh insights and inspiration, this book provides clinicians with clear direction and confidence for taking on the complexities of family work. It is a tried-and-true resource for both novice and experienced practitioners."--James L. Furrow, PhD, Evelyn and Frank Freed Professor of Marital and Family Therapy, Fuller Theological Seminary<br><br> "If I were to recommend only one family therapy text to a graduate student, this would be it. The third edition is an outstanding, thorough update that skillfully weaves in new insights from neuroscience, medicine, mindfulness, and trauma research. Most important for any beginning family therapist, the third edition is even more chock full of creative techniques for managing each clinical moment and the whole arc of family treatment. I&#x2019;ve been practicing for 45 years, and I find Doing Family Therapy to be stimulating and clinically wise, as well as fun. It reminds me of why I fell in love with family therapy in the first place."--David C. Treadway, PhD, private practice, Weston, Massachusetts<br><br> "Looking for an introduction to family therapy that is comprehensive, practical, and engaging? Try this book. In a disarmingly entertaining style, Taibbi addresses fundamental aspects and challenges of doing family therapy with acumen and depth."--Harry J. Aponte, MSW, LCSW, LMFT, Department of Couple and Family Therapy, Drexel University<br><br> "Doing family therapy can be challenging even for the most experienced of us--and for beginners it can be an ordeal for both the family and therapist. That is why this book is such a valuable resource. Taibbi draws from a variety of approaches and integrates them smoothly into a highly pragmatic work that includes concrete advice and realistic examples. I recommend it for novice therapists, who will take comfort in the clarity of Taibbi's guidance, as well as veterans, who will find plenty of material with which to identify and compare notes."--Richard C. Schwartz, PhD, Department of Psychiatry, Harvard Medical School/Cambridge Health Alliance<br><br> "Taibbi offers us front-row seats for observing the heart and soul of family therapy at its best. With depictions of challenging family cases, he does a brilliant job of bringing to life the importance of passion, courage, risk taking, and humor in clinical work. This is a great resource to turn to for practical family therapy tools and strategies--and for a strong dose of inspiration when feeling stuck."--Matthew D. Selekman, MSW, LCSW, Director, Partners for Collaborative Solutions, Evanston, Illinois<br><br> "In the third edition of this excellent text, we are reinvited into the world of actually doing family therapy--as opposed to merely learning about theories and techniques. Taibbi has done it again, providing an eminently helpful resource for students. The book is replete with all the wonder, anxiety, joy, frustration, and courage that surrounds the choice to work in and with the power of living human family systems. My students loved the prior edition, and I plan to use the third edition in my Family Therapy class in the fall."--J. Vincent Nevins, PhD, LMFT, Counseling Psychology Department, Dominican University of California<br><br> "I&#x2019;ve used <i>Doing Family Therapy </i>for my Clinical Social Work Practice: Couples and Families course for 10 years. Master's students love this book because of Taibbi&#x2019;s personal, relatable writing style. He builds excellent rapport with the reader and utilizes the clinical relationship to model and teach through the text. The use of case examples for every therapeutic principle grounds the material in real-life clinical experience and helps to alleviate some of the anxiety that often plagues new therapists. Students also find the end-of-chapter 'Looking Within' exercises to be especially beneficial, especially when we expand on them in class discussion. The third edition more clearly identifies the elements of the process of doing family therapy, with remarkably sensitive methods and strategies for holding, framing, working in, and managing those processes."--Victoria A. Fitton, PhD, LMSW, ACSW, MSW Program Director, Michigan State University<br><br>"Frequently, the mere notion of managing more than one client in the room, managing clients of different ages, or managing the intensity of family interactions is intimidating for clinicians of any experience level who are just coming to family work. Taibbi's...book would be a useful place to start for beginning family therapists and clinicians from other disciplines beginning to do family therapy." (on the second edition), <i>Journal of Marital and Family Therapy</i> Published On: 2015-03-09<br><br>&#x201c;Robert Taibbi, a seasoned clinician, writes with an integration of intellectual confidence and empathy that is inviting to the beginning therapist. At the same time, this book provides an avenue for a more seasoned therapist to pursuing ongoing development. The text is substantive with a powerful reinforcement of pragmatic, sound principles that are integral to the practice of family therapy, regardless of the theoretical approach. The logical, organized presentation of topics helps organize the therapist's thinking about managing the family therapy process, beginning with the elements that serve as a foundation on which a family therapist develops skill, and progressing to strategies for ongoing skill development."<i></i> (on the second edition), <i>Bulletin of the Menninger Clinic</i> Published On: 2015-03-09</p><h2>Quartered Safe Out Here: A Harrowing Tale of World War II</h2><p><b>George MacDonald Fraser&#x2014;beloved for his series of Flashman historical novels&#x2014;offers an action-packed memoir of his experiences in Burma fighting the Japanese during World War II.

A passionate advocate of craftsmanship over mass production, he designed a huge variety of objects, but it is his spectacular carpet, fabric, and wallpaper patterns that have continued to capture the popular imagination and influence interior designers and the decorative arts. Around six hundred such designs are attributed to Morris, most of which are based on nature, including trees, plants, and flowers.</p><p>This beautifully designed, accessibly priced gift book offers a wealth of designs by Morris where flowers are the principal motif. The text traces the origins of Morris&#x2019;s flower-based designs: his own gardens at the Red House in Kent; sixteenth- and seventeenth-century herbals; illuminated medieval manuscripts; late medieval and Renaissance tapestries; and the range of decorated objects, particularly from the Islamic world, that Morris studied at the South Kensington Museum, now the Victoria and Albert Museum.</p><p>Authored by Rowan Bain, senior curator at the William Morris Gallery, and lavishly illustrated with over one hundred color illustrations, <em>William Morris&#x2019;s Flowers</em> will both inform and delight.</p> 120 color illustrations</p><p><strong>Rowan Bain</strong> is senior curator at the William Morris Gallery, Walthamstow, London, and was formerly assistant curator at the Victoria and Albert Museum.

Hell&#x2019;s gates, but they ruin everything!</p><p>I&#x2019;m called Vercingetorix the Red, and not for my reddish hair. I&#x2019;ve traveled the length and breadth of the Empire, and I&#x2019;ve traveled much of it gloved in blood: the men I killed as a desperate boy fighting for his life in the Colosseum, and the men I killed as a steel-clad legionary standing shield-to-shield against the Empire&#x2019;s enemies. My story should be all blood and battle, swords clashing and shields creaking, full of warrior splendor like I&#x2019;d dreamed as a foolish youth.</p><p>So how in the name of all the gods did my gore-and-glory tale get so thoroughly taken over by <i>women</i>?</p><p>Perhaps all men&#x2019;s stories are overtaken by women. I&#x2019;m a man of Rome, with all that entails&#x2014;a citizen, a soldier, a paterfamilias&#x2014;and all men of Rome think they stride the earth and make it tremble. We make the laws and then punish the lawless; we make the borders and then punish the border-breakers; we record our own glory and then demand our names be remembered&#x2014;all over the Empire we stride and we bellow, we make and we break. But if men are the makers and breakers of empires, then women are the makers and breakers of men.</p><p>This tale of mine isn&#x2019;t the story of Vercingetorix the Red anymore, or even of the Emperor who hated me. That sounds like a good story, I know, but it&#x2019;s not this story. This story belongs to the women&#x2014;the women in blue, as I like to think of them. So many: the blue-veiled girl who broke my heart and married my enemy, the blue-scarfed girl whose heart I broke and who became <i>my</i> enemy, the blue-jeweled girl who married my dearest friend and harbored more than enough reasons to fear me&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p><p>And the girl who stood before me now in the blue tunic, wide-eyed and bloody-kneed and so young, whom I was sending to her death. Her, most of all.</p><p>&#x201c;<i>Annia</i>,&#x201d; I roared, and her eyes flickered over the blood on my hands, the body lying limp at my feet. <i>&#x201c;Annia, run!&#x201d;</i></p><p>And Annia runs. So fast, just a streak of blue fading away from me, and I wonder, <i>Can she outrun death?</i> Because if she can&#x2019;t, an empire falls. You&#x2019;d think the fate of the Eternal City would depend on someone like me, a warrior with bloody hands and a bloody sword. But it will rise or fall on a woman&#x2014;and maybe it always does.</p><p>But I&#x2019;m getting ahead of myself. I&#x2019;m Vercingetorix: &#x201c;Vix&#x201d; to my friends, &#x201c;the Red&#x201d; to my men, and &#x201c;that pleb bastard&#x201d; to my enemies. I&#x2019;ve been a slave and a guard, a gladiator and a legionary, a centurion and a legion commander. I&#x2019;ve served (in various ways) three emperors, and I&#x2019;ve loved (in even more various ways) three blue-eyed women. I&#x2019;m Vercingetorix the Red, and this is <i>their</i> story.</p><p><i>A.D. 118, Summer</i></p><p>As I came striding out of the Imperial palace at dawn, I had three causes to be furious and one to be sick and scared. I hated admitting I was scared, so I focused on the rage instead, and all the reasons for it. For one thing, I was wearing the full, ridiculous parade armor of my rank as tribune in the Praetorian Guard, from the absurd plumed helmet to the ridiculous muscled cuirass, and I hated that armor with every drop of blood in me. Give me a plain legionary breastplate any day. For a second reason, the day was already sweltering hot although the sun had barely risen over the rooftops, and sweat collected where the battered lion skin lapped my neck&#x2014;the lion skin I&#x2019;d won when I was promoted for courageous action in Dacia a long time ago, a lion skin I wasn&#x2019;t supposed to wear as a Praetorian, but wore anyway because it meant I was more than a pretty palace guard.</p><p>The third reason I was furious? Because on this summer day, I&#x2019;d have to watch my greatest enemy march through the Eternal City&#x2019;s gates for the first time as Emperor of Rome.</p><p>As for why I felt cold and scared, well, I refused to think about that.</p><p>I came out into the full glare of sunlight and stopped. My guardsmen were lined up in immaculate red-and-gold rows&#x2014;Praetorians were good at looking immaculate&#x2014;and below was the bustle of the Imperial court, chamberlains trying to organize us all for the Emperor&#x2019;s arrival. One of them leeched onto my elbow droning, but I didn&#x2019;t hear a word because I was looking down the marble steps at a woman in Imperial purple who stared past me as though I were not there. I immediately added her to the list of reasons why this was a black, black day. Empress Vibia Sabina had spent the last year ignoring me, and I didn&#x2019;t like being ignored.</p><p>&#x201c;Lady,&#x201d; I greeted her.</p><p>&#x201c;Tribune,&#x201d; she returned coolly.</p><p>I felt my jaw jut. People assumed the Empress and I didn&#x2019;t like each other, and that was a reasonable assumption. I didn&#x2019;t get along at all with the old Empress, a rancid Imperial bitch who couldn&#x2019;t lay eyes on me without sniffing like she smelled a drain. But Empress Sabina was a different matter. I&#x2019;d known her since she was a senator&#x2019;s barefoot daughter and I&#x2019;d been a lanky young guard in her father&#x2019;s pay. We&#x2019;d been friends, we&#x2019;d been enemies, we&#x2019;d been too many things to count. Now we were an empress and a guard, and if it was my job to keep her alive, I&#x2019;d be damned if I&#x2019;d be looked through like I was a window.</p><p>Sabina extended a hand to the chamberlain for assistance into her curtained litter. Maybe it was petty, but I brushed the man aside and offered my hand instead, not letting her dismiss me like a slave. Her fingers were narrow and smooth in my big rough paw, and her blue eyes flicked over me once as she settled among the cushions. A supple, sinuous woman maybe a year younger than my thirty-five: a little three-cornered face like a shield, a draped <i>stola</i> of Imperial purple, and wide beaten-silver cuffs adorning her wrists and ankles. She looked regal and shackled, and I saw she had her statue face on. When she wore that face you&#x2019;d never in a thousand years know what she was thinking. Empress Sabina had Imperial purple in her veins as well as on her back: oceans of patrician-cool self-possession all the way down to the deep and hidden center of her.</p><p>But maybe it was a good thing. Of the two of us, Sabina would at least have the self-control to look the Emperor of Rome in the eye and lie like a Greek. I wasn&#x2019;t sure I had the self-control to keep myself from hitting the bastard the moment I saw his smug, bearded face.</p><p>We were to greet him at the gates of the city, and the moment was almost here. The air hung like a warm wet cloak as the Imperial procession creaked off into the twisting streets. Rome: that old whore of a city with her overflowing gutters and feral dogs; the plump, brisk housewives with baskets over their arms and vendors crying wares on corners. My city. I hadn&#x2019;t been born here; I hadn&#x2019;t even loved my time here&#x2014;I&#x2019;d started out as a slave and a gladiator, and Rome would&#x2019;ve been happy to chew me up and spit out my bones on the sand of the arena. But I&#x2019;d gotten out at the expense of some blood and a few deaths, and then this fickle bitch of a city kissed me instead, sent me vaulting up the ladder in the legions under Emperor Trajan. Trajan came before Hadrian, and Trajan I had loved&#x2014;but there was no Trajan anymore. Just Rome, and she owned me. Everyone in the city from the idle drunks to the idle rich was pressing along the streets for a look at their new Emperor.</p><p>Well, not quite new. Hadrian had put on the purple a full year ago, but he&#x2019;d learned his lesson from Emperors who celebrated their glory before solidifying it&#x2014;no one ever said the bastard was stupid. He spent his first year making the rounds of the eastern legions, promising, cajoling, bribing. It wasn&#x2019;t till he was sure of his position that he returned to Rome itself, and he&#x2019;d sent me instructions for his triumphal entry:</p><p><i>Pomp</i>, Hadrian had written in his terse script. <i>Sacrifices. Gladiatorial games. Rose petals. Cheering crowds. Oh, and let&#x2019;s take care of the executions on that list I gave you.</i></p><p>That&#x2019;s why people weren&#x2019;t inclined to cheer. From the back of my ill-tempered gelding I had a fine view over the procession of senators in their snowy rows, and they were a grim, unsmiling lot. A frightened lot, too. They knew the names on that list; Hadrian had had those names rammed down the Senate&#x2019;s collective throat in open session. Men of note; men who should have been safe; senators and former consuls and war heroes who considered themselves untouchable. But no one was safe when Hadrian looked at you&#x2014;and he made sure we all knew it.</p><p>The chamberlains fussed again at the city gates, babbling protocols, but I just swung off my horse and ignored them. So did Empress Sabina; she sat reading a scroll and ignoring the Imperial steward flapping at her. &#x201c;Lady, the Empress must be first to greet her husband upon his return to hearth and home; if you will array yourself <i>here</i>&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I will be first,&#x201d; a woman&#x2019;s deep, loud voice intoned. It was that rancid old bitch Plotina, widow to the previous Emperor. &#x201c;If anyone is to welcome Dear Publius home to the Eternal City, it will be his mother.&#x201d;</p><p>Empress Sabina spoke, still reading. &#x201c;His mother is dead, Plotina.&#x201d;</p><p>The old empress in her dark purple silks gave a patronizing smile. &#x201c;Mother in all but name, Vibia Sabina.&#x201d;</p><p>God, but she was insufferable. How a man like the late Emperor Trajan&#x2014;straightforward, vigorous, with a love of common soldiers and dirty jokes&#x2014;had ended up with that straitlaced cow of a wife, I had no idea. Politics, I suppose. I was a gutter-born bastard free to marry the girl I loved, and I had, but those of the senatorial class married for power. I&#x2019;m not sure if any power would&#x2019;ve been worth wedding Plotina, with her graying wings of hair and the way she mouthed her words like pronouncements carried down from the gods. She was mouthing more pronouncements at Sabina&#x2014;the unsatisfactory daughter-in-law who&#x2019;d taken her place as Empress of Rome.</p><p>&#x201c;You may be Empress, my girl.&#x201d; Plotina lowered her voice, but guards like me always have an excuse to hover. &#x201c;But only because I made Dear Publius Emperor. Remember that. He certainly will.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Of course, because we all know he&#x2019;s just aching to see you again.&#x201d; Sabina tossed her scroll aside, swinging out of the curtained litter. &#x201c;How many letters did my husband write you while he was away, for all those long screeds of advice you sent him every other day?&#x201d;</p><p>A sniff from the old Empress, and then we all took our places. I held my post at Sabina&#x2019;s elbow, watching a drop of sweat ease down the long ribbon of her neck from under her plaited wig. She&#x2019;d never been a woman to fuss with her hair; she&#x2019;d shorn it clean off at some point so it covered her head in a silky cap of light brown. But she was Empress now, so someone had jammed a wig over that shocking shorn head. Probably Empress Plotina, who waited with her whole body quivering like a horse at the starting line of the Circus Maximus. Her eyes gleamed fever-bright as she remarked to the air, &#x201c;Dear Publius keeps us waiting, but that is a god&#x2019;s prerogative. He is a god incarnate, you know.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Have you been inhaling too much of that Imperial purple dye?&#x201d; Sabina asked conversationally. &#x201c;Sometimes I wonder.&#x201d;</p><p>I almost laughed, but then the cry went up.</p><p>&#x201c;He comes!&#x201d;</p><p>I looked beyond the gates to see dust, billowing like a storm cloud on the road approaching the city. A great roar went up from the waiting crowd, and Sabina spoke softly. &#x201c;Are they so eager to see him?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;They want the largesse they&#x2019;ll get if they cheer, Lady.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;How do you know?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Because I made a formal announcement that they&#x2019;d get largesse if they cheered.&#x201d;</p><p>Sabina smiled, her Imperial mask cracking briefly to show the girl who had cantered around the Empire in search of adventure. It was hard not to smile at that girl, even if you sometimes wanted to put a leash on her.</p><p>She studied me a moment, and her serious expression returned. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s wrong, Vix? You&#x2019;re smiling, but you&#x2019;ve been coiled tight as a rope all morning. Are you dreading something? Besides <i>that</i>,&#x201d; she added with a glance at the approaching storm of dust that was her husband.</p><p><i>I&#x2019;m dreading a death</i>, I almost said. Five executions were coming, but one would be worse than all the others combined. I&#x2019;d dreaded it during this whole past year like a leaden weight in my stomach. And it was coming, once this rose-petaled pomp was done. The Emperor had ordered those deaths, and just because he&#x2019;d changed his mind after the arrests were made&#x2014;&#x201c;Leave them alive in their cells till I return,&#x201d; he&#x2019;d written me, &#x201c;I will see the executions myself&#x201d;&#x2014;didn&#x2019;t mean blood wasn&#x2019;t still going to be spilled.</p><p>Empress Sabina knew whose death I dreaded. She dreaded it, too. I saw her hesitate as though hunting for words, but then the trumpets blared, and she remembered to ignore me. I had a moment to resent that, even over the sick swoop in my stomach, but she was right to do it. We were safer that way, both of us. We turned away from each other at the same instant&#x2014;immaculate Empress, stone-visaged guard; nothing but cool, impersonal space between us&#x2014;to face the Emperor.</p><p>Publius Aelius Hadrian.</p></p><h2>The Beekeeper&#39;s Problem Solver: 100 Common Problems Explored and Explained</h2><p><p>Beekeeping requires understanding, commitment, and attention to detail.

Readers will learn how each book of the Old Testament was understood by its first readers, how it advances the larger message of the whole Bible, and what its message contributes to Christian belief and the Christian community. Twenty maps, ninety photos, sidebars, and recommendations for further study add to the book's usefulness for students. Resources for professors are available through Baker Academic's Textbook eSources.</p><p>"A groundbreaking historical, theological, and critical introduction to the Old Testament that goes far beyond other introductions in terms of breadth, depth, and scope.

Inspired by the scientific ferment sweeping through Britain, the botanist had sailed with Captain Cook in search of new worlds.

He is an incomparable biographer, but in <i>The Age of Wonder</i>, he rises to new heights and becomes the biographer not of a single figure, but of an entire unique period, when artist and scientist could share common aims and ambitions and a common language--and together create a "romantic," humanist science. We are once again on the brink of such an age, when science and art will come together in new and powerful ways. For this we could have no better model than the lives of William and Caroline Herschel and Humphry Davy, whose dedication and scientific inventiveness were combined with a deep sense of wonder and poetry in the universe. Only Holmes, who is so deeply versed in the people and culture of eighteenth-century science, could tell their story with such verve and resonance for our own time.</p> <p>(Photo ï¿½ Elena Seibert)</p><b>Richard Holmes </b>is the author of <i>Footsteps: Adventures of a Romantic Biographer; Sidetracks: Explorations of a Romantic Biographer; Dr. Johnson &amp; Mr. Savage; Shelley: The Pursuit</i> (for which he received the Somerset Maugham Award); <i>Coleridge: Early Visions; </i>and <i>Coleridge: Darker Reflections </i>(a <i>New York Times Book Review </i>Editors&#x2019; Choice and a National Book Critics Circle Award finalist).

The stories, coming from Mohawk, Hopi, Yaqui, Haida and other cultures, demonstrate the power of animals in Native American traditions.<br><br>Parents, teachers and children will delight in lovingly told stories about "our relations, the animals." The stories come to life through magical illustrations by Mohawk artists John Kahionhes Fadden and David Fadden.<br><br>"The stories in this book present some of the basic perspectives that Native North American parents, aunts and uncles use to teach the young. They are phrased in terms that modern youngsters can understand and appreciate ... They enable us to understand that while birds and animals appear to be similar in thought processes to humans, that is simply the way we represent them in our stories. But other creatures do have thought processes, emotions, personal relationships...We must carefully ccord these other creatures the respect that they deserve and the right to live without unnecessary harm. Wanton killings of different animals by some hunters and sportsmen are completely outside the traditional way that native people have treated other species, and if these stories can help develop in young people a strong sense of the wonder of other forms of life, this sharing of Native North American knowledge will certainly have been worth the effort." &#x2014;excerpt from the forward by Vine Deloria, Jr.<br><br>These stories first appeared in <i>Keepers of the Animals: Native American Stories and Wildlife Activities for Children</i> by Michael J.

In front of the water, the driver saw two men in uniform standing next to a fire barrel, compact assault rifles slung over their shoulders, hands hovering above the barrel to ward off the chill. He slowed instinctively. The passenger said, &#x201c;Keep going. Don&#x2019;t give them any reason to suspect anything.&#x201d;</p><p>The driver huffed slightly, strangely giddy at the turn his life had taken.</p><p>Suspect? Right. I&#x2019;m sure they won&#x2019;t wonder why an American in a business suit is traveling with an Arab wearing ratty jeans. Or why I&#x2019;m sweating like a whore in church in the middle of winter.</p><p>The American continued at reduced speed, using the melted snow on the roadway as an excuse, doing whatever he could to slow the inevitable showdown. The Arab said, &#x201c;Easy. Very, very easy. You get us through this, and you&#x2019;re free. Remember that.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Okay, okay. What do you want me to say? Should I tell them who I am?&#x201d;</p><p>The American prayed the man with the gun would say yes, because he was sure there was a massive manhunt for him involving security agencies from at least two countries.</p><p>The Arab said, &#x201c;No. Of course not. We are tourists like everyone else coming down this road.&#x201d;</p><p>The Arab caught the disappointment on the driver&#x2019;s face and smiled. &#x201c;Remember, only one of us inside this vehicle is afraid to die.&#x201d;</p><p>The American nodded, wiping the sweat off his upper lip. He pulled into the checkpoint and lowered the window. One officer approached while the other began a sweep of the undercarriage with a mirror on a shaft. The American gave a nervous smile and waited.</p><p>The policeman said something in Norwegian. The American said, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry. English?&#x201d;</p><p>With a heavy accent, the policeman said, &#x201c;Business here?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;We&#x2019;re just visiting. We wanted to see the fortifications of the old town. Maybe go to the museum.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Okay. But the museum is closed.&#x201d;</p><p>The American knew that. What was going on in the museum was the primary reason the man to his right held a gun. He felt nauseous and overwhelmed. Beads of perspiration rolled down his face despite the freezing air, a direct result of being squeezed between two armed men, one using subterfuge and the other standing out in the cold precisely to penetrate the charade. He had nothing to do with either, but that would matter little when the bullets began to fly.</p><p>He stammered, &#x201c;C-can we just see the old town, then? Surely the square isn&#x2019;t closed.&#x201d;</p><p>The officer studied him for a moment, then said, &#x201c;Car registration, please.&#x201d;</p><p>The American felt the panic blossom. He had no idea if the vehicle even had valid registration, or where it would be stored. But the Arab did. Right hand held low, hiding the pistol, he used his left to dig through the glove box, pulling out a leatherette envelope and passing it through the window.</p><p>The policeman took it, saying to the American, &#x201c;Are you all right?&#x201d;</p><p>He wiped his upper lip again and said, &#x201c;Yes, fine. A bit of a cold, I think.&#x201d;</p><p>The policeman said nothing, studying the forms inside the envelope. Still looking down, he said, &#x201c;What is your name?&#x201d;</p><p>The American knew whatever he said, it wouldn&#x2019;t match the forms the policeman held. The Arab knew it as well. The American stammered for an answer and caught movement in his peripheral vision. His brain recognized the nightmare a millisecond before the pistol went off right next to his face, the explosion consuming the inside of the vehicle, splitting his eardrums apart.</p><p>The policeman&#x2019;s head snapped back, blood sprouting out and the body crumpling. The American screamed, crouching down and covering his head. The Arab turned to find the other policeman. He was outside the passenger window, frantically attempting to bring his rifle to bear, the mirror dropped to his feet. The Arab fired through the window, shattering the glass and hitting the policeman in the chest, the bullet sending up a small puff of goose-down from his jacket, belying the destruction wrought beneath.</p><p>The policeman whirled in a half circle, then fell to the ground, crawling towards a ditch and clawing at the rifle on his back. The Arab exited the vehicle and stalked over to him, putting a boot into his back, pinning him in place. He yanked the man&#x2019;s head up by the hair, placed the barrel against the back of his skull and pulled the trigger, a plug of gore exiting the man&#x2019;s open mouth and staining the snow underneath.</p><p>The American sagged into his seat, the absolute violence destroying any vestige he might have had for self-defense. The Arab calmly returned to the car, walking around to the driver&#x2019;s side. He said, &#x201c;Get in the passenger seat.&#x201d;</p><p>The American did so, numb. The Arab slid behind the wheel and rolled up the window. He locked the doors, then began digging beneath the driver&#x2019;s seat. He pulled out a small box the size of a cigarette package, a thin wire snaking back under the seat.</p><p>He flipped a switch on the box and a small light turned green. The American said, &#x201c;What is that thing?&#x201d;</p><p>The Arab bared his teeth and said, &#x201c;Your ticket to paradise.&#x201d;</p><p>He put the Rover into gear and drove across the small moat, entering the ancient fortress.</p><p>For all of his fear and naivetï¿½, the American was not a stupid man. He knew what the little container represented. The Arab&#x2019;s intentions had become painfully clear. This isn&#x2019;t a hostage situation. They never wanted me.</p><p>He was riding in a homemade cruise missile. A mobile bomb directed by a thinking, breathing human being. And he was going to die. None of the power from his position would alter that.</p><p>The vehicle made a left turn as soon as it crossed the moat, the Arab with one hand on the wheel and one holding the weapon aimed at the American. As if he could do anything now. He was close to catatonic, rocking forward and back in the passenger seat. Begging for a miracle.</p><p>The vehicle picked up speed, racing down the asphalt lane, the brick and stone buildings from centuries ago a blur outside the window. The American heard the Arab curse and opened his eyes. He saw the Arab staring into the rearview mirror. The American rotated around and caught a man on a motorcycle right behind them. A rider on a BMW, closing in on the bumper, no helmet, long hair blowing in the wind.</p><p>A man the American thought he recognized, but that would be impossible. Even so, he began to hope.</p><p>The driver began chanting in Arabic, stoically reciting something over and over. A brick wall appeared outside of the passenger window, protection for a courtyard built long ago. The museum.</p><p>They reached the end of the lane and the Arab whipped the Range Rover around the turn, tracking the brick wall. The American saw the entrance to the museum about two hundred meters ahead, a milling of men in suits walking to cars parked outside.</p><p>And another BMW motorcycle headed right towards them.</p><p>The bike raced by the entrance, security men shouting as it passed, brandishing weapons way too late.</p><p>The motorcycle grew larger, playing an insane game of chicken. To their left was an ancient berm, to the right the brick wall of the museum. There was no way to avoid each other. The Arab dropped the weapon and put both hands on the wheel, then floored the accelerator. The American screamed, jamming his foot against a non-existent brake pedal in the passenger well.</p><p>The motorcycle kept coming, the rider also without a helmet, his jaw clenched and teeth bared.</p><p>And the American recognized him as well, but couldn&#x2019;t believe it. There was no way that man was here.</p><p>They closed within fifty feet and the biker yanked his handlebars, diving off as the motorcycle went into a slide, the gravel spraying as it sliced into the ground.</p><p>The Arab screamed, jerking the wheel and slamming the vehicle into the berm. The world tumbled into a kaleidoscope of images. Sky, tearing metal, ground, shattered glass. The American slammed into the door, then the roof, coming to rest upside down on the seat of the Range Rover, the vehicle sliding to a stop on the passenger side. He heard nothing but the ticking of the engine.</p><p>The Arab to his right began to stir, slowly rising up and searching for the box, and the American realized he had seconds to alter his destiny. He slapped his hands on the man&#x2019;s wrist, and the Arab punched him straight in the mouth, knocking him back. He rose up, the siren call of self-preservation pushing him forward, and he heard multiple cracks, the Arab&#x2019;s face popping open as if someone had driven in fishhooks and then ripped them out.</p><p>The Arab toppled over in the seat, the box held in his hands.</p><p>The American sat still for a moment, stunned, the steam rising from the engine, one wheel still grinding as it rotated freely. He looked out the windshield and saw his savior. The man from the rear motorcycle, a huge grin on his face and holding a smoking gun.</p><p>The American sagged into the seat, unbelieving. After two hours of hell, he was alive. He floundered in the seat for a second, getting his feet underneath him, then began the climb out of the driver&#x2019;s door above him, a smile plastered on his face. He jerked the door handle, finding it unable to open, but the window through it was shattered and clear. He clawed his way past the body of the Arab, struggling to escape through the sliver of daylight, hearing shouting from the front.</p><p>He looked forward through the stars in the windshield and saw his savior screaming at him to stop. Confused, he simply grinned, and continued on. The man shouted again, now frantically waving his arms. He paused, wondering what was causing the concern. He looked down, and saw his foot on the small cigarette box. An innocuous thing, held in the hand of the dead Arab. He lifted his foot, and the box fell out, a long, long drop to the other side of the vehicle.</p><p>The last thing his mortal life experienced was a flash of light. No heat, although his body was consumed in fire a millisecond later.</p></p><h2>Young Investigators: The Project Approach in the Early Years (Early Childhood Education Series)</h2><p><p>Now in its Third Edition, <em>Young Investigators</em> provides an introduction to the project approach with step-by-step guidance for conducting meaningful investigations with young children.

Garner&#39;s Redbook: A Manual on Legal Style, 4th Edition (Coursebook)</h2><p>Since first appearing in 2002, Bryan Garner's <i>The Redbook: A Manual on Legal Style</i> has established itself as the go-to source for all questions of legal style (apart from citation form). The book isn't just one talented man's effort: Garner has two experienced coauthors plus a hands-on team of 54 editorial advisers, most of whom have long and valuable experience teaching LRW. The book is a one-of-a-kind resource--the legal writer's equivalent of <i>The AP Stylebook</i> or <i>The Chicago Manual of Style</i>.<br><br>The brand-new fourth edition has lots of new material, including an especially helpful new chapter on handling quotations. The two exhaustive indexes (word and subject), plus the detailed table of contents, make it easy to find authoritative guidance within seconds, whatever the question might be.<br><br>The author, Bryan Garner, is now the most frequently cited author in opinions of the U.S. Supreme Court. It's true: last term, four of his books were cited a total of 14 times (in the somewhat fewer than 90 cases decided). This term the count is on a similar pace.

As Arthur soon discovers, the dark shadow of the prison stretches far beyond its walls to affect the lives of many, from the kindly Mr Panks, the reluctant rent-collector of Bleeding Heart Yard, and the tipsily garrulous Flora Finching, to Merdle, an unscrupulous financier, and the bureaucratic Barnacles in the Circumlocution Office. A masterly evocation of the state and psychology of imprisonment, Little Dorrit is one of the supreme works of Dickens's maturity. Stephen Wall's introduction examines Dickens's transformation of childhood memories of his father's incarceration in the Marshalsea debtors' prison. This revised edition includes expanded notes, appendices and suggestion for further reading by Helen Small, a chronology of Dickens's life and works, and original illustrations.&nbsp;<br><br>For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world. With more than 1,700&nbsp;titles, Penguin Classics represents a global bookshelf of the best works throughout history and across genres and disciplines. Readers trust the&nbsp;series to provide authoritative texts enhanced by introductions and notes by distinguished scholars and contemporary authors, as well as up-to-date&nbsp;translations by award-winning translators.</p><p>The classic, definitive, world-famous Nonesuch Press edition of 1937, finally available again and bound in leather and linen. The text in these stunning volumes is taken from the 1867 Chapman and Hall edition, which became known as the Charles Dickens edition and was the last edition to be corrected by the author himself. The Nonesuch edition contains full-color illustrations selected by Dickens himself, by artists including Hablot Knight Browne ("Phiz"), George Cruikshank, John Leech, Robert Seymour, and George Cattermole.<br><br> <i>The Nonesuch Dickens</i> reproduces the original elegance of these beautiful editions. Books are printed on natural cream-shade high quality stock, quarter bound in bonded leather with cloth sides, include a ribbon marker, and feature special printed endpapers. Each volume is wrapped in a protective, clear acetate jacket.<br><br> The books are available as individual volumes, or as sets. The six-volume set contains <i>Oliver Twist, Bleak House, Christmas Books, Nicholas Nickleby, David Copperfield,</i> and <i>Great Expectations</i> together with <i>Hard Times</i>. The three-volume set contains <i>A Tale of Two Cities, Little Dorrit,</i> and <i>The Life and Adventures of Martin Chuzzlewit</i>.Of the complex, richly rewarding masterworks he wrote in the last decade of his life, Little Dorrit is the book in which Charles Dickens most fully unleashed his indignation at the fallen state of mid-Victorian society. Crammed with persons and incidents in whose recreation nothing is accidental or spurious, containing, in its picture of the Circumlocution Office, the most witheringly exact satire of a bureaucracy we possess, Little Dorrit is a stunning example of how thoroughly Dickens could put his flair for the theatrical and his comic genius the service of his passion for justice.</p><h2>The Comedy Bible: From Stand-up to Sitcom--The Comedy Writer&#39;s Ultimate &#34;How To&#34; Guide</h2><p>Judy Carter, guru to aspiring comedy writers and stand-up comics, tells all about the biz of being funny and writing funny in this bright, entertaining, and totally practical guide on how to draw humor from your life and turn it into a career.<br><br>Do you think you&#x2019;re funny? Do you want to turn your sense of humor into a career? If the answer is yes, then Judy Carter&#x2019;s <i>The Comedy Bible</i> is for you. The guru to aspiring stand-up comics provides the complete scoop on being&#x2014;and writing&#x2014;funny for money.<br> <br>If you&#x2019;ve got a sense of humor, you can learn to make a career out of comedy, says Judy Carter. Whether it&#x2019;s creating a killer stand-up act, writing a spec sitcom, or providing jokes for radio or one-liners for greeting cards, Carter provides step-by-step instructions in <i>The Comedy Bible.</i> She helps readers first determine which genre of comedy writing or performing suits them best and then directs them in developing, refining, and selling their work. <br> <br>Using the hands-on workbook format that was so effective in her bestselling first book, <i>Stand-Up Comedy: The Book,</i> Carter offers a series of day-by-day exercises that draw on her many years as a successful stand-up comic and the head of a nationally known comedy school. Also included are practical tips and advice from today&#x2019;s top comedy professionals&#x2014;from Bernie Brillstein to Christopher Titus to Richard Lewis. She presents the pros and cons of the various comedy fields&#x2014;stand-up, script, speech and joke writing, one-person shows, humor essays&#x2014;and shows how to tailor your material for each. She teaches how to find your &#x201c;authentic&#x201d; voice&#x2014;the true source of comedy. And, perhaps most important, Carter explains how to take a finished product to the next level&#x2014;making money&#x2014;by pitching it to a buyer and negotiating a contract. <br> <br>Written in Carter&#x2019;s unique, take-no-prisoners voice, <i>The Comedy Bible</i> is practical, inspirational, and funny.</p><p><b>Judy Carter </b>is an author, speaking/comedy coach, and speaker. Her message of using comedy techniques to decrease cubicle stress makes Carter an in-demand speaker for Fortune 500 companies where her keynotes entertain and inspire.<b>From Part One: Warm-up -- Is There Any Hope for You?</b> <p> <b>What Do You Want to Be When You Grow Up?</b> </p><p> </p><blockquote><b>"When adults ask kids, 'What do you want to be when you grow up?' they're just looking for clues themselves."<p> </p></b><p><b> -- Paula Poundstone</b></p><p></p></blockquote> <p> There are a lot of ways to make a living from comedy. You can perform it, write it, draw it, or manage it. From the list below, check which ones you're interested in or think you know you're good at.</p><p> </p><p> <b>Performing Comedy</b></p><p> </p><p> </p><ul> <li><b>Stand-up comic</b> <p> Depending on the quality of your act, you can work at comedy clubs, hotels, concert venues, colleges, or corporate meetings, on cruise ships, at open mikes, or at your aunt Thelma's eightieth birthday party. </p><p> </p></li><li><b>Improviser</b> <p> Sketch TV shows such as <i>Saturday Night Live</i> and <i>Mad TV</i> scout improvisers from improv troupes such as Second City (in Chicago and Toronto) and the Groundlings (in Los Angeles), as well as improv festivals (Austin, Texas, Montreal, Canada). Improvisers are in demand for acting and TV commercials as well as for voice-over work, feature animation, and game shows. </p><p> </p></li><li><b>Commercial actor</b> <p> Funny people who can add sizzle to ad copy are cast in high-paying TV commercials. </p><p> </p></li><li><b>Voice-over performer</b> <p> Comedy timing and technique are required in this field, which needs comics to add funny character voices to cartoons, TV commercials, and feature animation. </p><p> </p></li><li><b>Warm-up for TV shows</b> <p> Most TV shows hire a comic to warm up the live studio audience before and during the taping of TV shows and infomercials. </p><p> </p></li><li><b>Radio comedy</b> <p> Funny song parodies turned unknown "Weird Al" Yankovic into a famous and rich man. Radio stations buy prerecorded song parodies, impersonations, and other comedy bits produced by small production houses that specialize in creating this type of material. </p><p> </p></li><li><b>Radio talk show host</b> <p> As more talk shows fill the AM and FM airwaves, radio producers are turning to comics to keep their listeners laughing and listening. </p><p> </p></li><li><b>Cruise ship entertainer</b> <p> Imagine doing your act for your grandmother -- that's the kind of act you need to work cruise ships. If you've got four different twenty-minute <i>clean</i> sets and don't mind living with your audience for a few weeks, then this could be for you. </p><p> </p></li><li><b>Corporate humorist</b> <p> If you can make people laugh with clean material, then entertaining at corporate events might be just your thing. </p><p> </p></li></ul> <p> <b>Writing Comedy</b></p><p> </p><p> </p><ul> <li><b>Customized stand-up material</b><p> </p><p> Some stand-up comics who perform supplement their income by writing for other comics. And then there are those funny people who have never done stand-up themselves but who write it for others, such as funnyman Bruce Vilanch, who writes for Bette Midler and the <i>Academy Awards show.</i> </p><p> </p></li><li><b>TV sitcoms</b><p> </p><p> Comics are hired to staff sitcoms or develop sitcoms for stand-up comics who have development deals. Many of the most successful sitcoms are based on stand-up comedy acts. Stand-up comics Larry David and Jerry Seinfeld became billionaires when they turned their stand-up acts into one of the most successful sitcoms ever -- <i>Seinfeld.</i> </p><p> </p></li><li><b>Punch-up</b><p> </p><p> TV and film producers hire comics for the important job of punching up, or adding laughs to, a script. </p><p> </p></li><li><b>Screenwriting and directing</b><p> </p><p> Comedy directors often start their careers with live performances. Betty Thomas started in an improv troupe and went on to direct features such as <i>The Brady Bunch Movie.</i> Tom Shadyac, director of <i>Patch Adams, Liar, Liar,</i> and <i>The Nutty Professor,</i> actually started out in my stand-up workshop. Two years later, he directed his first feature, <i>Ace Ventura.</i> </p><p> </p></li><li><b>Literary writing</b><p> </p><p> "Funny" can also translate into books, magazine articles, and newspaper columns. George Carlin turned his unused stand-up material into the book Brain Droppings. Comedy director/screenwriter Nora Ephron <i>(You've Got Mail, Sleepless in Seattle)</i> wrote short funny magazine pieces that later became a popular book, <i>Mixed Nuts.</i> Dave Barry expresses his "funny" in a nationally syndicated column and in books. </p><p> </p></li><li><b>Development and producing</b><p> </p><p> Funny ideas often translate into projects for commercial TV and film. Paul Reubens's character Pee-wee Herman started out as a character in an improv show at the Groundlings. It turned into an HBO special, two feature films, and an award-winning children's TV series. </p><p> </p></li><li><b>Animation writing</b><p> </p><p> All major studios actively look for funny people to write and punch up their TV and feature animation projects. Irene Mecchi began as a comedy writer, writing comedy material for Lily Tomlin. Now she works for Disney animation and was the screenwriter of The <i>Lion King.</i> </p><p> </p></li><li><b>Internet work</b><p> </p><p> Because a good laugh can stop an Internet surfer at a Web site, companies such as Excite, Yahoo!, and AOL hire comics to write catchy copy. </p><p> </p></li><li><b>Speechwriting</b><p> </p><p> Many CEOs and politicians turn to comedy writers to provide sound bites so that they get noticed, win over their audiences, and don't get stuck with their foot in their mouth. </p></li></ul> <p> </p><blockquote>"I know what they say about me -- that I'm so stiff that racks buy their suits off me."<p> </p><p> -- Al Gore, 1998, written by Mark Katz</p></blockquote><p> </p><p> <b>Marketing Comedy</b> </p><p> </p><ul> <li><b>Merchandising</b><p> </p><p> Funny ideas can turn into funny products, such as Pet Rocks, screen savers, or greeting cards. Skyler Thomas, who started writing jokes in my class, put his jokes on T-shirts. They became major sellers and he now runs a multimillion-dollar T-shirt business called Don't Panic, with stores nationwide. </p><p> </p></li><li><b>Ad copy</b><p> </p><p> Who do you think writes those funny bits in ads that get your attention? Comedy writers. </p><p> </p><blockquote>"Most relationships don't last as long as the L.A. Marathon."<p> </p><p> -- L.A. billboard</p></blockquote><p> </p><p> </p></li><li>Managing and booking <p> </p></li><li>Many agents and managers started by putting shows together for themselves and ended up booking others. <p> </p></li></ul> <p> Right now, of course, you don't need to make a commitment to any specific comedy field. Actually, no matter which field of comedy you are interested in at the start of this book, be open to the possibility of shifting winds. You might be totally committed to performing stand-up until someone offers you a $50,000-a-year job writing funny ads for toilet cleaners. It could happen. </p><p> You might start off thinking you want to be a stand-up comic and end up discovering that you have a lot of ideas that can work as sitcoms. Billy Riback started out doing <i>stand-up</i> at the Improv at $25 a night, and now he produces comedy TV shows making millions. Conan O'Brien and Garry Shandling were both sitcom writers before they became comedy stars. In 1978 David Letterman was a joke writer for Jimmie "Dy-No-Mite" Walker. The Zucker brothers and Jim Abrahams, who created and directed the movies <i>Airplane!, Naked Gun,</i> and <i>Ghost,</i> began their careers in a comedy improv troupe in Madison, Wisconsin, called Kentucky Fried Theater. And then there's Gary Coleman, who started off as a comedy actor starring in his own sitcom and ended up as a security guard. Go figure! </p><p> The various fields of comedy can morph into one another. Sometimes a comic's act becomes the basis for a sitcom <i>(Roseanne),</i> or a screenplay becomes a sitcom <i>(M*A*S*H, Suddenly Susan).</i> Even jokes have become merchandise: Rosie O'Donnell's slingshot toy has sold over 2 million units. </p><p> I became a stand-up comic thanks to United Airlines. I started off as a funny magician working at the Magic Castle in Hollywood -- I levitated celery, sawed a man in half, and performed a death-defying escape from my grandmother's girdle. United Airlines changed the course of my career when I arrived in Cincinnati and my act arrived in Newark. That night I walked onstage without my tricks, without an act. I was so scared that I just started babbling about what happened, and to my surprise, I got laughs. I then ranted about all the humiliations of my life and the laughs got bigger, and before I knew it, my twenty-minute set ended. It was then that I learned the biggest lesson about comedy: truth is funny and shows up even when your luggage doesn't. I became a stand-up comic, because why schlepp around a bunch of props when people will pay you just for your ideas? Recently I've added to my work schedule by doing funny motivational speaking at Fortune 500 companies. Who knew? </p><p> The bottom line is, funny people are not limited to one field of comedy, and many of them overlap. For right now, you don't need to know what you want to be when you grow up -- all you need is your sense of humor. But first, let's make sure you have one. </p><p> </p><p> <b>The Right Stuff -- Do You Have What It Takes?</b> </p><p> Some people, no matter how hard they try, just aren't funny. It takes a certain disposition to do comedy. So, how do you know if you have the right stuff? </p><p> <b>The Yuk Factor</b> </p><p> Circle the answers that describe you best. </p><p> <b>yes no</b> Do you think that you're funnier than most of the schmucks you see on TV? </p><p> <b>yes no</b> Every time you open your mouth, does an inner voice say, "You should be writing this down" -- even during sex? </p><p> <b>yes no</b> Are you jealous of everyone who makes a living from comedy? </p><p> <b>yes no</b> Could you think of funny jokes even at a funeral? </p><p> <b>yes no</b> Do you ever think that you are the only sane one in your crazy family? </p><p> <b>yes no</b> When you get angry, do you get funny? </p><p> <b>yes no</b> Would you tell people your most embarrassing moments and inadequacies if you could get a laugh? </p><p> <b>yes no</b> Do you notice the quirks of life that other people miss? </p><p> <b>yes no</b> Do you study the minute details of life, such as lint? </p><p> <b>yes no</b> Do you sometimes imagine a future full of the im...</p></p><h2>Nemesis (An FBI Thriller)</h2><p><b>&#x201c;Fans of Lee Child and Patrick Lee won&#x2019;t be disappointed&#x201d;* in this high-octane FBI Thriller featuring Dillon Savich and Lacey Sherlock from the #1<i> New York Times</i> bestselling author.</b><br> <b>&nbsp;</b><br> In New York, Special Agent Lacey Sherlock foils a terrorist attack at JFK airport, but stopping the grenade-carrying crazy was only the beginning.

She lives in Sausalito, California.JFK AIRPORT<br>NEW YORK CITY<p>Wednesday afternoon</p><p>Mid-May</p><p>The airport security line slowly inched forward, nearly sixty passengers stoically weaving back and forth in the ritual strip-dance everyone knew and put up with. At least Sherlock didn&#x2019;t have her Glock with her, so she wouldn&#x2019;t have to fill out a gazillion forms. Her meeting with the lead federal prosecutor in an upcoming murder trial had lasted six and a half hours, and probably would have gone on longer if she hadn&#x2019;t simply gotten up and said she had a plane to catch. She couldn&#x2019;t wait to get home and throw a football with Sean, if the plane took off at a reasonable time, that is. She looked forward to downing a cup of Dillon&#x2019;s knock-your-socks-off coffee, and having him sing to her while he scrubbed her back in the shower.</p><p>Out of habit she studied the faces, the eyes, the clothes, and the body language of those around her, guessing what people were thinking, planning, where they were going. Home? Business? Rendezvous? She knew one thing for sure: they were hoping as she was that flights wouldn&#x2019;t be delayed or canceled. The woman ahead of her sighed. &#x201c;All I want to do is get home, jump in the tub, and wash off all traces of Mickey Sturgiss.&#x201d;</p><p>Sherlock said, a smile on her face, &#x201c;A wild day with Mickey?&#x201d;</p><p>The woman rolled her eyes. &#x201c;A deposition for a slime bucket who should be deported to Mars.&#x201d;</p><p>Sherlock laughed. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re a lawyer?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, but not this idiot&#x2019;s lawyer. I was doing his lawyer a favor. Believe me, I&#x2019;ll make sure he knows he owes me big-time.&#x201d; She stuck out her hand. &#x201c;Melissa Harkness.&#x201d;</p><p>Sherlock shook her hand. &#x201c;Lacey Sherlock. Come to think of it, I could do some washing, too.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t tell me you&#x2019;re a lawyer, too?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m FBI, actually.&#x201d; Melissa Harkness was on the heavy side, in her thirties, and she was carrying a large briefcase in one hand and a black tote the size of one of Jupiter&#x2019;s moons in the other. She looked like she might be dragging, but her bright eyes were filled with intelligence and interest.</p><p>Her laugh at Sherlock&#x2019;s name started them off, and soon they were talking about Sherlock&#x2019;s dad, a federal judge, and Sherlock&#x2019;s job as an FBI agent, as the line slowly snaked its way toward the TSA folk ensconced on their high stools, checking each ticket and ID.</p><p>Sherlock noticed a tall man a couple people ahead of Melissa. He was standing stock-still, as if frozen in place. The man behind him had to nudge him, unheard of in an airport security line with everyone wanting to move forward quickly. He was dark-haired and on the thin side. What caught her eye was the fact that his lower face was bone white, as if he&#x2019;d recently shaved off a full beard, perhaps that very morning. He looked calm, but she saw his hands were trembling as he pulled off his black loafers and placed them in a bin. Something was off. She watched him shrug off his coat and start on his belt. Then, without warning, he turned, shoved aside the two passengers behind him, and grabbed Melissa around the neck. He pulled something out of his briefcase&#x2014;it was a grenade. He waved it around, all the while backing away, pulling Melissa with him. When people around them realized what was happening, there were screams and shouts, everyone focused on the grenade held high over his head now, a finger through the safety ring. He yelled, his voice shaking as badly as his hands, &#x201c;That&#x2019;s right, it&#x2019;s a grenade!&#x201d; He screamed at the TSA agents, who were now speaking into their walkie-talkies, several of them moving toward him. &#x201c;Nobody move! Your X-ray isn&#x2019;t much use now, is it? It doesn&#x2019;t matter I&#x2019;m not lily-white!&#x201d; He pointed the grenade at a tall black TSA agent who was trying to flank him. &#x201c;Or black! All of you&#x2014;stay away or she dies, along with the rest of you.&#x201d; He stopped moving when he felt a concrete pillar behind his back.</p><p>A TSA agent called out, only a bit of a wobble in her voice, &#x201c;Sir, put the grenade down and we can talk about what you want.&#x201d;</p><p>He laughed. &#x201c;Really? I know how you idiots operate. Even without this grenade, you&#x2019;d probably have taken me to one of your little rooms and ordered me to strip down, treated me like a criminal&#x2014;that&#x2019;s because you target men who look Middle Eastern, and that&#x2019;s profiling and it&#x2019;s against the law.&#x201d; His voice was near a scream now. Sherlock heard a French accent overlying the British clip, with a trace of Farsi or Arabic. &#x201c;Because I&#x2019;m dark and wear a beard?&#x201d; Had he forgotten he&#x2019;d shaved it off? &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t come any closer or we all die right now!&#x201d; He tightened his hold around Melissa&#x2019;s neck. Her hands were pulling at his arm, her face turning blue.</p><p>The TSA agents were slowly flanking him as he talked. Sherlock knew airport security would arrive at any second, all of them trained to deal with such a threat, but it didn&#x2019;t matter. They weren&#x2019;t here yet. She was on the spot, a few feet away from him, looking right into his eyes. His arm was still around Melissa&#x2019;s neck, his finger still hooked around the grenade&#x2019;s ring. One pull and a whole lot of people would die, herself included. Her heart kettledrummed in her chest; the spit dried in her mouth. There was an instant of dead silence, only the sound of his hard, fast breathing. She called out, her voice calm and easy, &#x201c;Sir, what do you want?&#x201d;</p><p>He locked on Sherlock&#x2019;s face, tightened his death grip on Melissa, and held the grenade toward her. &#x201c;Who told you to talk, you stupid woman? Get back with the rest of the mutts and shut up!&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Sir, you obviously knew you couldn&#x2019;t get a grenade through X-ray, so you planned it this way. Why? What do you want? What if they simply let you leave?&#x201d; She wanted to see how tight his hold was on the grenade ring, but she forced herself to keep her eyes on his face.</p><p>He screamed at her, &#x201c;Shut up or you&#x2019;ll be the first one dead! You agents, stop moving around, do you hear me? Any more of you take a step toward me, I&#x2019;ll toss the grenade right in front of you!&#x201d;</p><p>The TSA agents stopped in their tracks, their eyes moving from him to Sherlock, and always back to the grenade he held in his shaking hand. The passengers stayed still as stones, as they&#x2019;d been told, hardly breathing, watching, praying. Sherlock heard a distant cacophony of voices, either running away or swarming closer to see what was happening. <i>Not good.</i> Airport security was beginning to inch toward him. He juked this way and that, trying to keep an eye on the agents. His eyes narrowed, sweat beaded on his face. What had he planned to do? Sherlock felt rage and fear rolling off him. Yet he hadn&#x2019;t pulled the pin. Why? Was he having second thoughts, or was he waiting to make some kind of statement? She saw it clearly on his face, he was struggling with himself, trying to rev himself up to kill as many people around him as possible, Melissa included. That was certainly what he&#x2019;d planned when he&#x2019;d taken off his shoes and set them in the bin. They didn&#x2019;t matter then because he knew he was going to die.</p><p>She looked at Melissa&#x2019;s face, at her eyes. She was terrified, but she was there, ready to do something if she could. Sherlock said to her, &#x201c;What&#x2019;s your name?&#x201d;</p><p>He was distracted and automatically loosened his hold. Melissa sucked in air. &#x201c;Melissa Harkness.&#x201d;</p><p>He was looking at Sherlock now, focused on her. <i>Good. </i>&#x201c;And what&#x2019;s your name, sir?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;None of your business!&#x201d; He raised the grenade higher, ran his tongue over his lips, and tightened his hold on Melissa&#x2019;s neck again.</p><p>&#x201c;Why don&#x2019;t you let Melissa go? She didn&#x2019;t do anything to you. Maybe I can call your wife, you can speak to her and to your children.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What are you talking about? You know nothing about my blessed wife. For you to even speak of her is an abomination.&#x201d; He kept swinging the grenade around to force airport security guards and TSA agents back.</p><p>Melissa was beginning to choke again, her fingers pulling against his arm.</p><p>Sherlock spoke quickly now. &#x201c;Does your wife expect you to die today and kill dozens of innocent people along with you? Does your wife even know what you&#x2019;re doing? Where is she now?&#x201d; She saw the security team moving even closer and she smelled fear, a raw corrosive in the air, from everyone around her, especially from him. He was as frightened as Melissa. She had to stop this now.</p><p>&#x201c;I told you not to speak of her. I&#x2019;m a British citizen, not some poor sod from Pakistan or Iran you can manipulate.&#x201d; He laughed, a scary laugh that was filled with derision and something buried deep, something that made him what he was, and something deeper, a kind of desperate bravado. He was trying to convince himself to accept his own death. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m from London&#x2014;that decadent city they call Londonistan. We will fight until we control the whole world, in the name of Allah.&#x201d;</p><p><i>What idiot taught you that? </i>It sounded like he&#x2019;d practiced saying it, exactly that way. <i>Why?</i> &#x201c;Despite what you said, I don&#x2019;t think you want to die. If you throw the grenade, that is what will happen. You&#x2019;ll die and you&#x2019;ll never see your family again. Do you want to be nothing at all in the flash of a second?&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Sweat bathed his face, and his hands trembled so badly Sherlock wondered how he could keep hold of the grenade ring. He bared his teeth at her. &#x201c;You shut your mouth.&#x201d;</p><p>Sherlock smiled. &#x201c;You throw the grenade and so many bullets will hit you from airport security, your body won&#x2019;t be able to hold itself together. Your wife won&#x2019;t be able to recognize you because your face will be blown off. Maybe she&#x2019;ll recognize your sock, the one with the hole in it.&#x201d;</p><p>He glanced down automatically at his foot and Sherlock ran at him. &#x201c;Melissa, drop!&#x201d;</p><p>Brave Melissa threw all her weight forward, pulling the terrorist with her. He struggled with her, off balance, and his finger slipped free of the grenade safety ring. Sherlock took two fast steps, reared back on the heel of her foot and kicked his right wrist, heard the bone crack. He screamed and dropped the grenade. Everyone froze, watched the grenade hit the floor with a loud thump and begin to roll. There was mayhem&#x2014;yelling and people running to get as far away from the grenade as possible, pushing others out of their way, some of them falling to the floor, a stampede, and over it all security shouting, &#x201c;Everyone get down! Get down!&#x201d;</p><p>The terrorist was holding on to his wrist, cursing her, but he didn&#x2019;t come at her, he lunged for the grenade. Sherlock ran after him, kicked him hard in the kidney. He whooshed out a breath as he fell forward onto his hands and knees, hissing in pain as he crawled toward the grenade, now fetched up against a security counter. She prayed none of the security officers would lose it and shoot, since she was so close to him now.</p><p>She yelled at him, &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t do it!&#x201d;</p><p>He twisted back to look at her, fear and desperation glazing his eyes, screamed curses, and dove for the grenade, his good arm outstretched. She kicked him in the head. He fell forward, sprawling away from the grenade, but still Sherlock saw his fingers reach out and pull the ring free of the grenade. Thankfully, the safety lever stayed attached, still in place, but for how long?</p><p>Everyone remained frozen in place, terrified, all eyes on the grenade.</p><p>One, two, three agonizingly slow seconds&#x2014;nothing happened.</p><p>She didn&#x2019;t have handcuffs, so Sherlock planted her foot on the middle of his back and pressed down. &#x201c;Listen to me, get hold of yourself. If you don&#x2019;t move, the grenade might not explode and you might survive this.&#x201d;</p><p>The man was heaving for breath, murmuring over and over something she couldn&#x2019;t understand. A prayer? To Allah? His eyes were tightly closed, one hand still pressed to his head where Sherlock had kicked him. He wasn&#x2019;t moving now. His other hand lay palm up three inches from the grenade.</p><p>He was weeping. He said in a whisper, &#x201c;You&#x2019;ve ruined it all. Now they&#x2019;ll die because of you.&#x201d; She leaned close, heard him whisper over and over, &#x201c;Bella, Bella.&#x201d; A woman&#x2019;s name, his wife&#x2019;s name?</p><p>&#x201c;Who&#x2019;s Bella?&#x201d;</p><p>He didn&#x2019;t even see her, didn&#x2019;t see anything beyond himself and what had happened.</p><p>She heard the loud buzz of voices all around her, but she ignored them. She looked up to see a man striding toward her, airport security officers flanking him, guns drawn. She&#x2019;d recognize a Big Dog anywhere. He had to be the chief of security here at JFK, ex-military, tall, built, straight as an oak, with white buzz-cut hair. He yelled to all the huddled passengers, &#x201c;Do not panic. TSA agents will escort you away from here right now. Slowly, that&#x2019;s right. Clear the area!&#x201d;</p><p>As Sherlock lifted her foot and stepped away from the man, a half-dozen security agents covered him, picked him up, and dragged him away.</p></p><h2>I Can Make This Promise</h2><p><p><strong>In her debut middle grade novel&#x2014;inspired by her family&#x2019;s history&#x2014;Christine Day tells the story of a girl who uncovers her family&#x2019;s secrets&#x2014;and finds her own Native American identity. </strong></p><p>All her life, Edie has known that her mom was adopted by a white couple.

Engels argued that the traditional monogamous household was in fact a recent construct, closely bound up with capitalist societies. Under this patriarchal system, women were servants and, effectively, prostitutes. Only Communism would herald the dawn of communal living and a new sexual freedom and, in turn, the role of the state would become superfluous.</p><p>Friedrich Engels was born in 1820. In 1842 Engels went to Manchester to represent the family firm. Relationships there inspired the famous The Condition of the Working Class in England in 1844. Collaboration with Marx began in 1844 and in 1847 he composed the first drafts of the Manifesto. After Marx&#39;s death, he prepared the unfinished volumes of Capital for publication. He died in 1895. Dr Tristram Hunt is one of Britain&#39;s best known young historians.

Hockney&#x2019;s extensive research led him to conclude that artists such as Caravaggio, Velï¿½zquez, da Vinci, and other hyperrealists actually used optics and lenses to create their masterpieces.<p>In this passionate yet pithy book, Hockney takes readers on a journey of discovery as he builds a case that mirrors and lenses were used by the great masters to create their highly detailed and realistic paintings and drawings. Hundreds of the best-known and best-loved paintings are reproduced alongside his straightforward analysis. Hockney also includes his own photographs and drawings to illustrate techniques used to capture such accurate likenesses. Extracts from historical and modern documents and correspondence with experts from around the world further illuminate this thought-provoking book that will forever change how the world looks at art.</p><p><i>Secret Knowledge</i> will open your eyes to how we perceive the world and how we choose to represent it.</p><p></p></p><p>British painter David Hockney, well known for his cool and lovely paintings of California pools, has taken on the new role of detective. For two years Hockney seriously investigated the painting techniques of the old masters, and like any admirable sleuth, compiled substantial evidence to support his revolutionary theory. <i>Secret Knowledge</i> is the fruit of this labor, an exhaustive treatise in pictures revealing clues that some of the world's most famous painters, Ingres, Velï¿½zquez, Caravaggio (just to mention a few) utilized optics and lenses in creating their masterpieces. Hockney's fascination with the subject is contagious, and the book feels almost like a game with each analysis a "How'd they do that?" instead of a whodunit. While some may find the technical revelation a disappointment in terms of the idea of genius, Hockney is quick to point out that the use of optics does not diminish the immensity of artistic achievement. He reminds the reader that a tool is just a tool, and it is still the artist's hand and creative vision that produce a work of art. (296 pages, 460 illustrations, 402 in color.) <i>--J.P.

Like decking out our poor lost troopers for marriage rather than death. All their uniforms brushed down with lamp-oil into a state never seen when they were alive. Their faces clean shaved, as if the embalmer sure didn&#x2019;t like no whiskers showing. No one that knew him could have recognised Trooper Watchorn because those famous Dundrearies was gone. Anyway Death likes to make a stranger of your face. True enough their boxes weren&#x2019;t but cheap wood but that was not the point. You lift one of those boxes and the body makes a big sag in it. Wood cut so thin at the mill it was more a wafer than a plank. But dead boys don&#x2019;t mind things like that. The point was, we were glad to see them so well turned out, considering.<br><br> I am talking now about the finale of my first engagement in the business of war. 1851 it was most likely. Since the bloom was gone off me, I had volunteered&nbsp; aged seventeen in Missouri. If you had all your limbs they took you. If you were a one-eyed boy they might take you too even so. The only pay worse than the worst pay in America was army pay. And they fed you queer stuff till&nbsp;your shit just stank. But you were glad to get work because if you didn&#x2019;t work for the few dollars in America you hungered, I had learned that lesson. Well, I was sick of hungering.<br><br>Believe me when I say there is a certain type of man loves soldiering, no matter how mean the pay. First thing, you got a horse. He might be a spavined nag, he might be plagued by colic, he might show a goitre in his neck the size of a globe, but he was a horse. Second place, you got a uniform. It might have certain shortcomings in the stitching department, but it was a uniform. Blue as a bluebottle&#x2019;s hide.<br><br> Swear to God, army was a good life. I was seventeen or there- abouts beginning, I could not say for certain. I will not say the years going up to my army days was easy. But all that dancing put muscle on me, in a wiry sort of way. I&#x2019;m not speaking against my customers, I&#x2019;m speaking for them. If you pay a dollar for a dance you like a good few sweeps of the floor for that, God knows.<br><br> Yes, the army took me, I&#x2019;m proud to say. Thank God John Cole was my first friend in America and so in the army too and the last friend for that matter. He was with me nearly all through this exceeding surprising Yankee sort of life which was good going in every way. No more than a boy like me but even at six- teen years old he looked like a man right enough. I first saw him when he was fourteen or so, very different. That&#x2019;s what the saloon owner said too. Time&#x2019;s up, fellas, you ain&#x2019;t kids no more, he says. Dark face, black eyes, Indian eyes they called them that time. Glittering. Older fellas in the platoon said Indians were just evil boys, blank-faced evil boys fit to kill you soon as look at you. Said Indians were to be cleared off the face of the earth, most like that would be the best policy. Soldiers like to talk high. That&#x2019;s how courage is made most like, said John Cole, being an understanding man.<br><br> John Cole and me we came to the volunteering point together of course. We was offering ourselves in a joint sale I guess and the same look of the arse out of his trousers that I had he had too. Like twins. Well when we finished up at the saloon we didn&#x2019;t leave in no dresses. We must have looked like beggar boys. He was born in New England where the strength died out of his father&#x2019;s earth. John Cole was only twelve when he lit out a-wandering. First moment I saw him I thought, there&#x2019;s a pal. That&#x2019;s what it was. Thought he was a dandy-looking sort of boy. Pinched though he was in the face by hunger. Met him under a hedge in goddamn Missouri. We was only under the hedge as a consequence the heavens were open in a downpour. Way out on those mudflats beyond old St Louis. Expect to see a sheltering duck sooner than a human. Heavens open. I scarper for cover and suddenly he&#x2019;s there. Might have never seen him otherwise. Friend for a whole life. Strange and fateful encounter you could say. Lucky. But first thing he draws a little sharp knife he carried made of a broken spike. He was intending to stick it in me if I looked to go vicious against him. He was a very kept-back-looking thirteen years old I reckon. Anyhows under the hedge aforementioned when we got to talking he said his great-grandma was a Indian whose people were run out of the east long since. Over in Indian country now. He had never met them. Don&#x2019;t know why he told me that so soon only I was very friendly and<br> maybe he thought he would lose that blast of friendship if I didn&#x2019;t know the bad things quickly. Well. I told him how best to look at that. Me, the child of poor Sligonians blighted likewise. No, us McNultys didn&#x2019;t got much to crow about.<br><br> Maybe out of respect for the vulnerable soul of John Cole I might skip ahead violently and avoid an account of our earlier years. Except he might also acknowledge that those years were important in their way and I cannot say either that they constituted in any way a time of shameful suffering in particular. Were they shameful? I don&#x2019;t see eye to eye with that. Let me call them our dancing days. Why the hell not. After all we was only children obliged to survive in a dangerous terrain. And survive we did and as you see I have lived to tell the tale. Having made our acquaintance under an anonymous hedge it seemed natural and easy to join together in the enterprise of continuing survival. That is John Cole in his minority and I placed our steps side by side on the rainy road and proceeded into the next town in that frontier district where there were hundreds of rough miners working and a half dozen tumultuous saloons set up in a muddy thoroughfare endeavouring to entertain them.<br><br> Not that we knew much of that. In these times John Cole was a slight boy as I have laboured to illustrate with his river-black eyes and his lean face as sharp as a hunting dog. I was my younger self. That is though I was maybe fifteen after my Irish and Canadian and American adventures I looked as young as him. But I had no idea what I looked like. Children may feel epic and large to theyselves and yet be only scraps to view.<br><br> Just sick of stumbling round. Two is better together, he said.<br><br> So then our idea was to find work slopping out or any of the jobs abhorrent to decent folk. We didn&#x2019;t know much about adult persons. We just didn&#x2019;t know hardly a thing. We were willing to do anything and even exulted in the fact. We were ready to go down into sewers and shovel the shit along. We might have been happy to commit obscure murders, if it didn&#x2019;t involve capture and punishment, we didn&#x2019;t know. We were two wood-shavings of humanity in a rough world. We were of the opinion our share of food was there if we sought it out. The bread of heaven John Cole called it because after the fall of his father he has much frequented those places where hymns and meagre food was put into him in equal measure.<br><br> Weren&#x2019;t many places like that in Daggsville. Weren&#x2019;t any. Daggsville was all uproar, mucky horses, banging doors, queer shouting. By this time in my biographical ventures I must con- fess I was wearing an old wheat-sack, tied at the waist. It sorta looked like clothing but not much. John Cole was better in an old queer black suit that musta been three hundred years old, judging by the gaps in it. Anyway he was having a breezy time of it about the crotch, far as I could see. You could nearly reach in and measure his manhood, so your eyes did their best to be kept looking away. I devised a good method to deal with such a thing and fixed fiercely on his face, which was no work in itself, it was a pleasing face. Next thing comes up in our view a spanking new building all fresh wood and even a last sparkle in the recently beaten nailheads. Saloon a sign said, no more nor less. And underneath, on a smaller sign hanging from a string,&nbsp;Clean boys wanted.<br><br> Look, see, says John Cole, who didn&#x2019;t have the great learning I had, but had a little none the less. Well, he says, by my mother&#x2019;s loving heart, we do fulfil half of that requirement.<br> Straight in, and there was a highly pleasant quotient of good dark wood, dark panelling floor to ceiling, a long bar as sleek and black as an oil-seep. Then we felt like bugs in a girl&#x2019;s bonnet. Alien. Pictures of those fine American scenes of grandeur that are more comfortable to gaze on than to be in. Man there behind the bar, complete with chamois cloth, philosophically polishing a surface that needed no polishing. It was plain to see all was a new enterprise. There was a carpenter finishing up on the stairs going to the upward rooms, fitting the last section of a rail. The bartender had his eyes closed or he might have seen us sooner. Might even have given us the bum&#x2019;s rush. Then the eyes open and instead of the drawing back and cussing at us we ex- pected this more discerning individual smiled, looked pleased to see us.<br><br> You looking for clean boys? says John Cole, a tincture pugilistic right enough, still prophesying menaces.<br><br> You are right welcome, the man says. We are? said John Cole.<br><br> You are. You are just the thing, especially the smaller one there, he says. <br><br>That was me he was meaning. Then, as if he feared John Cole might take offence and stamp out away &#x2013; But you&#x2019;ll do too, he says. I&#x2019;m giving fifty cents a night, fifty cents a night each, and all you can drink, if you drink easy, and you can bunk down in the stable behind us, yes indeed, cosy and comfortable and warm as cats. That&#x2019;s if you give satisfaction.<br><br> And what&#x2019;s the work? says John, suspicious. <br><br>Easiest work in the world, he says.<br><br>Such as?<br><br> Why, dancing, dancing is all it is. Just dancing.<br><br> We ain&#x2019;t no dancers far as I know, says John, flummoxed now, violently disappointed.<br><br> You don&#x2019;t need to be dancers as such in the accepted dictionary definition of the word, says the man. It&#x2019;s not high-kicking anyhow.<br><br> Alright, says John, lost now just from a sense aspect &#x2013; but, we ain&#x2019;t got no clothes to be dancing in, that&#x2019;s for sure, he said, displaying his very particular condition.<br><br> Why, all&#x2019;s supplied, all&#x2019;s supplied, he says.<br><br> The carpenter had paused in his work and was sitting on the steps now, smiling big.<br><br> Come with me, gentlemen, says the bartender, likely the owner too, with his swank, and I will show you your clothing of work.<br><br> Then he strode over his spanking new floor in his noisy boots, and opened the door into his office. It had a sign on it said Office so we knew. Why, boys, after you, he said, holding the door. I got my manners. And I hope you got your manners, because even rough miners love manners, yes indeed.<br><br> So we troop in, all eyes. There&#x2019;s a rack of clothes like a gaggle of hanged women. Because it&#x2019;s women&#x2019;s clothes. Dresses. There was nothing else there, and we looked around thoroughly, we did.<br><br> Dancing starts eight sharp, he says. Pick something that fits.&nbsp;Fifty cents, each. And any tips you get is yours to keep.<br><br> But, mister, says John Cole, like he was talking to a pitiful insane person. We ain&#x2019;t no women. Can&#x2019;t you see. I is a boy and so is Thomas here.<br><br> No, you ain&#x2019;t women, I can see. I could verify that second you came in. You fine young boys. Sign says looking for boys. I would gladly sign up women but ain&#x2019;t no women in Daggs- ville but the storeman&#x2019;s wife and the stableman&#x2019;s little daughter. Otherwise it&#x2019;s all men here. But men without women can get to pining. It&#x2019;s a sort of sadness gets into their hearts. I aim to get it out and make a few bucks in the process, yes, sir, the great American way. They need only the illusion, only the illusion of the gentler sex. You&#x2019;re it, if you take this employment. It&#x2019;s just the dancing. No kissing, cuddling, feeling, or fumbling. Why, just the nicest, the most genteel dancing. You won&#x2019;t hardly credit how nice, how gentle a rough miner dances. Make you cry to see it. You sure is pretty enough in your way, if you don&#x2019;t mind me saying, especially the smaller one. But you&#x2019;ll do too, you&#x2019;ll do too, he says, seeing John Cole&#x2019;s newly acquired pro- fessional pride coming up again. Then he cocks an eyebrow, interrogatory like.<br><br> John Cole looks at me. I didn&#x2019;t care. Better than starving in a wheat-sack.<br><br> Alright, he says.<br><br> Gonna put a bath for you in the stable. Gonna give you soap. Gonna supply the underwears, muy importante. Brought with me from St Louis. You&#x2019;ll fill them fine, boys, I reckon&nbsp; you&#x2019;ll fill them fine, and after a few glasses no man I know will object. A new era in the history of Daggsville. When the lonesome men got girls to dance with. And all in a comely fashion, in a comely fashion.<br> And so we trooped out again, shrugging our shoulders, as if to say, it was a mad world, but a lucky one too, now and then. Fifty cents, each. How many times, in how many bowers before sleep in our army days, out on the prairie, in lonesome decliv- ities, we liked to repeat that, John and me, over and over, and never failing in our laughter, Fifty cents &#x2013; each.<br><br> That particular night in the lost history of the world Mr Titus Noone, for that was his name, helped us into our dresses with a sort of manly discretion. Give him his due, he seemed to know about buttons and ribbons and such. He had even had the fore- sight to sprinkle us with perfumes. This was the cleanest I had been in three years, maybe ever. I had not been noted in Ireland for my cleanliness truth be told, poor farmers don&#x2019;t see baths. When there is no food to eat the first thing that goes is even a flimsy grasp of hygiene.<br><br> The saloon filled quickly. Posters had been speedily put up around town, and the miners had answered the call. Me and John Cole sat on two chairs against a wall. Very girl-like, well behaved, sedate, and nice. We never even looked at the miners, we stared straight ahead. We hadn&#x2019;t ever seen too many sedate girls but a inspiration got into us. I had a yellow wig of hair and John had a red one. We musta looked like the flag of some country from the neck up, sitting there. Mr Noone had thoughtfully filled out our bodices with cotton. Okay but our feet were bare, he said he had forgotten shoes in St Louis. They might be a later addition. He said to mind where the miners stepped, we said we would. Funny how as soon as we hove into those dresses everything changed. I never felt so contented in my life. All miseries and worries fled away. I was a new man now, a new girl. I was freed, like those slaves were freed in the coming war. I was ready for anything. I felt dainty, strong, and perfected. That&#x2019;s the truth. I don&#x2019;t know how it took John Cole, he never said. You had to love John Cole for what he chose never to say. He said plenty of the useful stuff. But he never speaked against that line of work, even when it went bad for us, no. We were the first girls in Daggsville and we weren&#x2019;t the worst.<br><br> Every citizen knows that miners are all sorts of souls. They come into a country, I seen it a thousand times, and strip away all the beauty, and then there is black filth in the rivers and the trees just seem to wither back like affronted maids. They like rough food, rough whisky, rough nights, and truth to tell, if you is a Indian gi...</p><h2>Advocacy Practice for Social Justice</h2><p>Since the publication of its first edition in 2005,ï¿½<em>Advocacy Practice for Social Justice</em>ï¿½has served as a clear, comprehensive, and practical resource for social work courses in advocacy, community practice, and macro practice. Now in its fourth edition, this text provides extensive information on the value base for advocacy; an examination of why people get involved in advocacy; and step-by-step instructions for social workers and others who want to impact laws, regulations, and policies at any level. Bearing in mind the National Association of Social Workers' Code of Ethics' requirements to advocate on behalf of vulnerable populations, readers learn that advocacy is a problem-solving technique similar to that used in social work practice of all types. The book moves through the stages of advocacy: getting involved; understanding the issue; planning; advocating through education, persuasion, and negotiation; presenting information effectively; monitoring and evaluating results; and integrating advocacy into a social worker's everyday practice. The fourth edition's inclusion of new topics and solid foundation in social work values make it a must-read as social work students and practitioners work diligently to maintain the profession's focus on successful advocacy for social justice.<br></p><p><br><strong>Richard Hoefer</strong>, PhD, MA, MSSW, is Roy E.

Christ beckons them to His banqueting table and offers them a room in His house, but they foolishly give up the glory of the life He has offered. They come to Jesus as Redeemer but never go beyond the doorway to abide in Him and experience the unspeakable joy of dwelling with the King of Kings.<br> Andrew Murray knew what it meant to be continually in the Father&#x2019;s presence. Read these thirty-one heart-searching readings and learn how to live daily in closer communion and fellowship with Him. Accept God&#x2019;s invitation and live in His blessing and glory instead of shuffling your feet at the gate.</p><p><b>Andrew Murray</b> (1828&#x2013;1917) was an amazingly prolific Christian writer. He lived and ministered as both a pastor and author in the towns and villages of South Africa. Some of Murray&#x2019;s earliest works were written to provide nurture and guidance to Christians, whether young or old in the faith; they were actually an extension of his pastoral work. Once books such as <i>Abide in Christ, Divine Healing</i>, and <i>With Christ in the School of Prayer</i> were written, Murray became widely known, and new books from his pen were awaited with great eagerness throughout the world.<br> He wrote to give daily practical help to many of the people in his congregation who lived out in the farming communities and could come into town for church services only on rare occasions. As he wrote these books of instruction, Murray adopted the practice of placing many of his more devotional books into thirty-one separate readings to correspond with the days of the month.<br> At the age of seventy-eight, Murray resigned from the pastorate and devoted most of his time to his manuscripts. He continued to write profusely, moving from one book to the next with an intensity of purpose and a zeal that few men of God have ever equaled. He often said of himself, rather humorously, that he was like a hen about to hatch an egg; he was restless and unhappy until he got the burden of the message off his mind.<br> During these later years, after hearing of pocket-sized paperbacks, Andrew Murray immediately began to write books to be published in that fashion. He thought it was a splendid way to have the teachings of the Christian life at your fingertips, where they could be carried around and read at any time of the day.<br> One source has said of Andrew Murray that his prolific style possesses the strength and eloquence that are born of deep earnestness and a sense of the solemnity of the issues of the Christian life. Nearly every page reveals an intensity of purpose and appeal that stirs men to the depths of their souls. Murray moves the emotions, searches the conscience, and reveals the sins and shortcomings of many of us with a love and hope born out of an intimate knowledge of the mercy and faithfulness of God.<br> For Andrew Murray, prayer was considered our personal home base from which we live our Christian lives and extend ourselves to others. During his later years, the vital necessity of unceasing prayer in the spiritual life came to the forefront of his teachings. It was then that he revealed the secret treasures of his heart concerning a life of persistent and believing prayer.<br> Countless people the world over have hailed Andrew Murray as their spiritual father and given credit for much of their Christian growth to the influence of his priceless devotional books.<br> &nbsp;</p><h2>Becoming a Woman of Simplicity</h2><p><b>God Invites You to Be at Rest.</b><br>Can life in this multitasking world be tamed?

In the 1970s and '80s, Xerox Corporation brought together a brain-trust of engineering geniuses, a group of computer eccentrics dubbed PARC. This brilliant group created several monumental innovations that triggered a technological revolution, including the first personal computer, the laser printer, and the graphical interface (one of the main precursors of the Internet), only to see these breakthroughs rejected by the corporation. Yet, instead of giving up, these determined inventors turned their ideas into empires that radically altered contemporary life and changed the world.</p><p>Based on extensive interviews with the scientists, engineers, administrators, and executives who lived the story, this riveting chronicle details PARC's humble beginnings through its triumph as a hothouse for ideas, and shows why Xerox was never able to grasp, and ultimately exploit, the cutting-edge innovations PARC delivered. <em>Dealers of Lightning</em> offers an unprecedented look at the ideas, the inventions, and the individuals that propelled Xerox PARC to the frontier of technohistoiy--and the corporate machinations that almost prevented it from achieving greatness.</p></p><p>Throughout the '70s and '80s, Xerox Corporation provided unlimited funding to a renegade think tank called the Palo Alto Research Center (PARC). Occupying a ramshackle building adjacent to Stanford University, PARC's occupants would prove to be the greatest gathering of computer talent ever assembled: it conceptualized the very notion of the desktop computer, long before IBM launched its PC, and it laid the foundation for Microsoft Windows with a prototype graphical user interface of icons and layered screens. Even the technology that makes it possible for these words to appear on the screen can trace its roots to Xerox's eccentric band of innovators. But despite PARC's many industry-altering breakthroughs, Xerox failed ever to grasp the financial potential of such achievements. And while Xerox's inability to capitalize upon some of the world's most important technological advancements makes for an interesting enough story, <i>Los Angeles Times</i> correspondent Michael Hiltzik focuses instead on the inventions and the inventors themselves. We meet fiery ringleader Bob Taylor, a preacher's son from Texas known as much for his ego as for his uncanny leadership; we trace the term "personal computer" back to Alan Kay, a visionary who dreamed of a machine small enough to tuck under the arm; and we learn how PARC's farsighted principles led to collaborative brilliance. Hiltzik's consummate account of this burgeoning era won't improve Xerox's stake in the computer industry by much, but it should at least give credit where credit is due.

With dazzling insight, he untangles the pattern of interconnecting events: the accidents of time, circumstance, and place that gave rise to the major inventions of the world. <br> <br> Says Burke, "My purpose is to acquaint the reader with some of the forces that have caused change in the past, looking in particular at eight innovations -- the computer, the production line, telecommunications, the airplane, the atomic bomb, plastics, the guided rocket, and television -- which may be most influential in structuring our own futures....Each one of these is part of a family of similar devices, and is the result of a sequence of closely connected events extending from the ancient world until the present day. Each has enormous potential for humankind's benefit -- or destruction." <br> <br> Based on a popular TV documentary series, <i>Connections</i> is a fascinating scientific detective story of the inventions that changed history -- and the surprising links that connect them.</p><p>You can make all the plans you will, plot to make a fortune in the commodities market, speculate on developing trends: all will likely come to naught, for "however carefully you plan for the future, someone else's actions will inevitably modify the way your plans turn out." So writes the English scholar and documentary producer James Burke in his sparkling book <i>Connections</i>, a favorite of historically minded readers ever since its first publication in 1978. Taking a hint from Jacob Bronowski's <i>Ascent of Man</i>, Burke charts the course of technological innovation from ancient times to the present, but always with a subversive eye for things happening in spite of, and not because of, their inventors' intentions. Burke gives careful attention to the role of accident in human history. In his opening pages, for instance, he writes of the invention of uniform coinage, an invention that hinged on some unknown Anatolian prospector's discovering that a fleck of gold rubbed against a piece of schist--a "touchstone"--would leave a mark indicating its quality. Just so, we owe the invention of modern printing to Johann Gutenberg's training as a goldsmith, for his knowledge of the properties of metals enabled him to develop a press whose letterforms would not easily wear down. With Gutenberg's invention, Burke notes, came a massive revolution in the European economy, for, as he writes, "the easier it is to communicate, the faster change happens." Burke's book is a splendid and educational entertainment for our fast-changing time. <i>--Gregory McNamee</i><b>James Burke</b> is the author of several bestselling books, including <i>Circles, American Connections,</i> and <i>The Knowledge Web.</i> He is a monthly columnist at <i>Scientific American</i> and also serves as director, writer, and host of the television series <i>Connections 3</i> on The Learning Channel.

Especially in the West, we have created a frenzied lifestyle in which the twenty-ï¿½four hours of each day are carved up, dissected, and reduced down to ten minute units of efficiency. We take our iPhones and laptops with us on vacation. We check email at restaurants or our brokerage accounts while walking in the park. When the school day ends, our children are overloaded with &#x201c;extras.&#x201d; Our university curricula are so crammed our young people don&#x2019;t have time to reflect on the material they are supposed to be learning. Yet in the face of our time-driven existence, a great deal of evidence suggests there is great value in &#x201c;wasting time,&#x201d; of letting the mind lie fallow for some periods, of letting minutes and even hours go by without scheduled activities or intended tasks.<br> <br>Gustav Mahler routinely took three or four-ï¿½hour walks after lunch, stopping to jot down ideas in his notebook. Carl Jung did his most creative thinking and writing when he visited his country house. In his 1949 autobiography, Albert Einstein described how his thinking involved letting his mind roam over many possibilities and making connections between concepts that were previously unconnected. With <i>In Praise of Wasting Time</i>, Professor Alan Lightman documents the rush and heave of the modern world, suggests the technological and cultural origins of our time-ï¿½driven lives, and examines the many values of &#x201c;wasting time&#x201d;&#x2014;for replenishing the mind, for creative thought, and for finding and solidifying the inner self. Break free from the idea that we must not waste a single second, and discover how sometimes the best thing to do is to do nothing at all.</p><p>Alan Lightman is a physicist, novelist, and essayist. He was educated at Princeton University and at the California Institute of Technology, where he received a PhD in theoretical physics. Lightman is the author of five novels, including the international bestseller <i>Einstein&#x2019;s Dreams</i>, two collections of essays, a book-ï¿½length narrative poem, and several books on science. His writing has appeared in&nbsp;<i>The Atlantic</i>,&nbsp;<i>Granta</i>, <i>The New Yorker</i>, and <i>The New York Review of Books</i>, among other publications.&nbsp;In Praise of Wasting Time 1 A Village in Cambodia<p></p> <br>Not long ago, I found myself in a small village in a remote area of Cambodia. Many rural areas in the world have modern plumbing, electric ovens, satellite TVs, and other such technological conveniences, but not this one. The inhabitants of Tramung Chrum live in one-room huts without electricity or running water. Dangling light bulbs in the huts are powered by car batteries. Food is cooked over open fires. The villagers support themselves by growing rice, watermelons, and cucumbers. Their religion is a version of moderate Islam, called Imam San Cham, combined with animism. When someone needs healing, the villagers perform a ceremony in which they summon the spirits of ancestors, monkeys, and horses. The ghosts inhabit the bodies of the villagers, who dance wildly through the night. Other than these moments, the villagers go about their lives in quiet calm. They rise with the sun. After breakfast, they herd their cows out for grazing, then walk to the rice fields and tend to their crops. They return to their huts as the light starts to dim and gather firewood for cooking the evening meal.<br> <br>Each morning, the women ride their bicycles on a rutted red dirt road to a market ten miles away to trade for goods and food they cannot grow themselves. Through a translator, I asked one of the women how long the daily trip took. She gave me a puzzled look and said, &#x201c;I never thought about that.&#x201d;<br> <br>I was startled at her disinterest in time. And envious. We in the &#x201c;developed&#x201d; world have created a frenzied lifestyle in which not a minute is to be wasted. The precious twenty-four hours of each day are carved up, dissected, and reduced to ten-minute units of efficiency. We become agitated and angry in the waiting room of a doctor&#x2019;s office if we&#x2019;ve been sitting for ten minutes or more. We grow impatient if our laser printers don&#x2019;t spit out at least five pages per minute. And we must be connected to the grid at all times. We take our smartphones and laptops with us on vacation. We go through our email at restaurants. Or our online bank accounts while walking in the park. The teenagers I know (and some of their parents) check their smartphones at least every five minutes of their &#x201c;free&#x201d; waking hours. At night, many sleep with their phones on their chests or next to their beds. When the school day ends, our children are loaded with piano lessons and dance classes and soccer games and extra language classes. Our university curricula are so crammed that our young people don&#x2019;t have time to digest and reflect on the material they are supposed to be learning.<br> <br>I plead guilty myself. If I take the time to examine my own twenty-four hours per day, here&#x2019;s what I find: from the instant I open my eyes in the morning until I turn out the lights at night, I am at work on some project. First thing in the morning, I check my email. For any unexpected opening of time that appears during the day, I rush to patch it, as if a tear in my trousers. I find a project, indeed I feel compelled to find a project, to fill up the hole. If I have an extra hour, I can work at my laptop on an article or class lesson. If I have a few minutes, I can answer a letter or read an online news story. With only seconds, I can check phone messages. Unconsciously, without thinking about it, I have subdivided my day into smaller and smaller units of efficient time use, until there are no holes left, no breathing spaces remaining. I rarely goof off. I rarely follow a path that I think might lead to a dead end. I rarely &#x201c;waste&#x201d; time. And certainly, I would never ever spend a couple of hours of each day going to the market without knowing exactly how long the trip took and figuring out how to listen to an audiobook on the way.<br> <br>It&#x2019;s not only me. All around me, I feel a sense of urgency, a vague fear of not being plugged in, a fear of not keeping up. I feel like Josef K. in Kafka&#x2019;s The Trial, who lives in a world of ubiquitous suspicion and powerful but invisible authority. Yet there is no authority here, only a pervasive mentality.<br> <br>I can remember a time when I did not live in this way. I can remember those days of my childhood when I would slowly walk home from school by myself and take long detours through the woods. With the silence broken only by the sound of my own footsteps, I would follow turtles as they lumbered down a dirt path. Where were they going, and why? I would build play forts out of fallen trees. I would sit on the banks of Cornfield Pond and waste hours watching tadpoles in the shallows or the sway of water grasses in the wind. My mind meandered. I thought about what I wanted for dinner that night, whether God was a man or a woman, whether tadpoles knew they were destined to become frogs, what it would feel like to be dead, what I wanted to be when I became a man, the fresh bruise on my knee. When the light began fading, I wandered home.<br> <br>I ask myself: What happened to those careless, wasteful hours at the pond? How has the world changed? Of course, part of the answer is simply that I grew up. Adulthood undeniably brings responsibilities and career pressures and a certain awareness of the weight of life. Yet that is only part of what has happened. Indeed, an enormous transformation has occurred in the world from the 1950s and &#x2019;60s of my youth to today. A transformation so vast that it has altered all that we say and do and think, yet often in ways so subtle and ubiquitous that we are hardly aware of them. Among other things, the world today is faster, more scheduled, more fragmented, less patient, louder, more wired, more public. For want of a better phrase, I will call this world &#x201c;the wired world.&#x201d; By this term, I do not mean only digital communication, the Internet, and social media. I also mean the frenzied pace and noise of the world.<br> <br>There are many different aspects of today&#x2019;s time-driven, wired existence, but they are connected. All can be traced to recent technological advances and economic prosperity in a complex web of cause and effect. Throughout history, the pace of life has always been fueled by the speed of communication. The speed of communication, in turn, has been central to the technological advance that has led to the Internet, social media, and the vast and all-consuming network that I simply call &#x201c;the grid.&#x201d; That same technology has also been part of the general economic progress that has increased productivity in the workplace, which, when coupled with the time-equals-money equation, has led to a heightened awareness of the commercial and goal-oriented uses of time&#x2014;at the expense of the more reflective, free-floating, and non-goal-oriented uses of time.</p><h2>The Big Dipper (Let&#39;s-Read-and-Find-Out Science 1)</h2><p><p>Are the stars out tonight?</p><p>If they are, chances are you'll be able to spot the Big Dipper.

But Ralph Nickleby proves both hard-hearted and unscrupulous, and Nicholas finds himself forced to make his own way in the world. His adventures gave Dickens the opportunity to portray an extraordinary gallery of rogues and eccentrics: Wackford Squeers, the tyrannical headmaster of Dotheboys Hall, a school for unwanted boys, the slow-witted orphan Smike, rescued by Nicholas, the pretentious Mantalinis and the gloriously theatrical Mr and Mrs Crummels and their daughter, the 'infant phenomenon'. Like many of Dickens's novels, Nicholas Nickleby is characterised by his outrage at cruelty and social injustice, but it is also a flamboyantly exuberant work, whose loose, haphazard progress harks back to the picaresque novels of Tobias Smollett and Henry Fielding. In his introduction Mark Ford compares Nicholas Nickleby to eighteenth-century picaresque novels, and examines Dickens's criticism of the 'Yorkshire schools', his social satire and use of language.

Defying the expectations of her time, she decides to paint it.</p><p>New York City, 1957: The only known surviving work of Sara de Vos,<i> At the Edge of a Wood</i>, hangs in the bedroom of a wealthy Manhattan lawyer, Marty de Groot, a descendant of the original owner. It is a beautiful but comfortless landscape. The lawyer&#x2019;s marriage is prominent but comfortless, too. When a struggling art history grad student, Ellie Shipley, agrees to forge the painting for a dubious art dealer, she finds herself entangled with its owner in ways no one could predict.</p><p>Sydney, 2000: Now a celebrated art historian and curator, Ellie Shipley is mounting an exhibition in her field of specialization: female painters of the Dutch Golden Age. When it becomes apparent that both the original <i>At the Edge of a Wood </i>and her forgery are en route to her museum, the life she has carefully constructed threatens to unravel entirely and irrevocably.</p></p><p><strong>An Amazon Best Book of April 2016:</strong> Across three continents and four hundred years, Dominic Smith has spun a stunning tale of forgeries and deaths, deception and love to reveal the lasting legacy of a fateful brush stroke. Akin to the page-turning greats like <em>Girl with a Pearl Earring</em> and <em>The Goldfinch, The Last Painting of Sara de Vos</em> is held together by the gravitas of a single painting to tell the story of two women&#x2014;their mistakes and love affairs, their devotion to art and their struggles to thrive in a male dominated profession. When Ellie Shipley, a young art student, agrees to copy the seventeenth century painting, &#x201c;At the Edge of a Wood,&#x201d; her future becomes irrevocably entangled with Sara de Vos, the artist whose work she forged. Weaving together the past and present lives of Sara and Ellie and their two paintings, Smith brilliantly transports readers from 1950s New York - the mahogany walls of Upper West side apartments and the grit of Brooklyn, to the moody Dutch countryside of the 1600s to Sydney Australia&#x2019;s sun-soaked harbor in 2000. A vivid, enthralling novel that is as timeless and luminous as the painting itself. <em>--Al Woodworth</em><b>Dominic Smith</b> grew up in Australia and now lives in Austin, Texas.

The day was bitterly cold. The ferry inched along, bumping against huge chunks of ice. The trip seemed to take forever. John paced up and down the deck. </p><p> "This ferry just isn't good enough, Washington!" he exclaimed. "There should be a bridge here." </p><p> John Roebling was an engineer. His specialty was building bridges. As he looked across the East River, he could picture the bridge that he wanted there. He knew that it would be the most important one he would ever build. </p><p> For years after that, John tried to convince people that his plan for a bridge across the East River was a good one. Many liked the idea, especially those who lived in Brooklyn. They knew that as long as they had to depend on ferry boats to reach New York, Brooklyn would never become an important city. But most people thought it was impossible to bridge the wide and powerful river. </p><p> John knew it would be difficult. There were many problems to solve. The bridge would have to be strong enough to withstand the swift currents and powerful winds of the East River. It could not get in the way of the hundreds of boats that traveled on the river every day. It had to be so high that the masts of tall sailing ships could easily pass under it. And it had to be long. The East River was nearly half a mile wide at that point. But John also knew about a type of bridge that could solve all these problems. It was called a suspension bridge. </p></p><h2>PATRIARCHS AND PROPHETS</h2><p>Book by White, Ellen Gould Harmon</p><p></p><h2>Freak The Mighty</h2><p>Two boys &#x2013; a slow learner stuck in the body of a teenage giant and a tiny Einstein in leg braces &#x2013; forge a unique friendship when they pair up to create one formidable human force.

She lives in Tokyo, Japan.Grade 5 Up&#x2014;This fantasy takes place in a land reminiscent of ancient Japan, populated by the indigenous Yakoo people and the immigrant Yogo who now rule. Both peoples tell a story of a child and a water spirit but with much different details. For the Yogo, the child was possessed by a water demon, while for the Yakoo, the water spirit was essential to prevent a horrendous drought. Now, it seems that this spirit has returned and is somehow living in Prince Chagum, and his father feels that he must have his son assassinated to defeat the demon. Chagum's mother prevails upon Balsa, a bodyguard-for-hire, to flee the capital with Chagum. Balsa is wounded after fighting off four of the assassins and seeks shelter with her friend Tanda, a healer. As she begins to train Chagum in life outside the palace, Tanda and his teacher Torogai begin researching Yakoo folklore and employing magic to discover more about this water spirit. In the meantime, the Yogo Star Readers research their records. Only through their combined studies are they able to learn the nature of the true danger and the means to defeat it. Whether from the original or through the translation, there are a few rough spots in the dialogue. Still, this book should appeal to fans of medieval and fantasy manga and of Usagi Yojimbo. The forthcoming manga and anime will also create interest.&#x2014;<i>Eric Norton, McMillan Memorial Library, Wisconsin Rapids, WI</i> <br>Copyright ï¿½ Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Just two miles long and half a mile wide, it is remote, tranquil, and, these days, largely ignored.<br><br>Yet 370 years ago, Run's harvest of nutmeg (a pound of which yielded a 3,200 percent profit by the time it arrived in England) turned it into the most lucrative of the Spice Islands, precipitating a battle between the all-powerful Dutch East India Company and the British Crown. The outcome of the fighting was one of the most spectacular deals in history: Britain ceded Run to Holland but in return was given Manhattan. This led not only to the birth of New York but also to the beginning of the British Empire.<br><br>Such a deal was due to the persistence of one man. Nathaniel Courthope and his small band of adventurers were sent to Run in October 1616, and for four years held off the massive Dutch navy. Nathaniel's Nutmeg centers on the remarkable showdown between Courthope and the Dutch Governor General Jan Coen, and the brutal fate of the mariners racing to Run-and the other corners of the globe-to reap the huge profits of the spice trade. Written with the flair of a historical sea novel but based on rigorous research, <i>Nathaniel's Nutmeg</i> is a brilliant adventure story by a writer who has been hailed as the "new Bruce Chatwin" (<i>Mail</i> on Sunday).<br><br></p><p>Would you believe that nutmeg formed the basis of one of the most bitter international conflicts of the 17th century, and was also intimately connected to New York City's rise to global preeminence? Strange but true: nutmeg was, in fact, one of the most prized commodities in Renaissance Europe, and its fascinating story is told in Giles Milton's delightful <i>Nathaniel's Nutmeg</i>.<p> The book deals with the competition between England and Holland for possession of the spice-producing islands of Southeast Asia throughout the 17th century. Packed with stories of heroism, ambition, ruthlessness, treachery, murder, torture, and madness, <i>Nathaniel's Nutmeg</i> offers a compelling story of European rivalry in the tropics, thousands of miles from home, and the mutual incomprehensibility which often comically characterized relations between the Europeans and the local inhabitants of the prized islands.</p><p> At the center of the action lies Nathaniel Courthope, a trusty lieutenant of the East India Company, who took and held the tiny nutmeg-producing island of Run in the face of overwhelming Dutch opposition for more than five years, before being treacherously murdered in 1620. To avenge his death, and the loss of the island, the British took the Dutch North American colony at Manhattan. (As Milton wittily remarks, although Courthope's death "robbed England of her nutmeg, it gave her the biggest of apples").</p><p> Inevitably inviting comparisons with Dava Sobel's <i>Longitude</i>, <i>Nathaniel's Nutmeg</i> is a charming story that throws light on a neglected period of European history, and analyzes its fascination with the "spicy" East. <i>--Jerry Brotton, Amazon.co.uk</i></p>The tiny island of Run is an insignificant speck in the middle of the Indonesian archipelago, remote, tranquil, and now largely ignored. At the beginning of the seventeenth century, however, Run's harvest of nutmeg turned it into the most lucrative of the Spice Islands, precipitating a fierce and bloody battle between the all-powerful Dutch East India Company and a small band of ragtag British adventures led by the intrepid Nathaniel Courthope. The outcome of the fighting was one of the most spectacular deals in history: Britain ceded Run to Holland but in return was given Manhattan.<p>A brilliant adventure story of unthinkable hardship, savagery, the navigation of uncharted waters, and the exploitation of new worlds, Nathaniel's Nutmeg is a remarkable chapter in the history of the colonial powers.</p></p><h2>Irish Wisdom Preserved in Bible and Pyramids</h2><p>This is a new release of the original 1923 edition.</p><p></p><h2>Little Mermaid</h2><p>Adapted by master pop-up artist Robert Sabuda, this timeless, classic tale by Hans Christian Andersen comes to life. With magical, intricate pop-ups, readers dive under the sea into the three-dimensional fantastical kingdom where the drama unfolds. From the sea to the ship to the castle, we follow this tale of true love, adventure and sacrifice. As the little mermaid opens her heart, she will captivate reader&#39;s, making this a sure favourite in every family&#39;s library.</p><p>Robert Sabuda is one of the most innovative and inventive children&#39;s book creators and is known worldwide for his amazing pop-up paper engineering. His books include Alice&#39;s Adventures in Wonderland, The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, The Twelve Days of Christmas, The Night Before Christmas, The Winter&#39;s Tale, Peter Pan, Beauty and the Beast, to name but afew, have garnered numerous awards and have made the New York Times bestseller lists on many occasions. He lives in New York City.Gr 1-4-Illustrations and pop-ups that sparkle with shimmering light and graceful motion characterize the latest title adapted by a master bookmaker. Much abridged and gently updated, the text closely follows the original, often echoing Andersen's phrasings and similes while streamlining events to create an eloquent yet accessible retelling. The little mermaid's heartfelt longing for her human prince, her quiet courage, and her selfless sacrifice at story's end are poignantly depicted in both words and images. Outlined with heavy black lines that lend a stained-glass effect, the artwork is spectacular. Glowing green and coral hues emblazon a multitiered sculpture of the sea king's realm festooned with plants that seem to tremble in an invisible current. The prince's storm-tossed ship is presented with the bow jabbing out toward readers, 3-D masts and ropes askew, and roiling blue-black ocean waves curling all around; the sea witch's abode, "built from the bones of shipwrecked sailors," towers tall and menacing. The stately pacing of narrative and artwork allows children to linger over the pages and explore the depths of the tale's emotional complexity.-Joy Fleishhacker, School Library Journal&#x3b1;(c) Copyright 2013.

In thoughtful, straightforward books like <i>The Quest for Cosmic Justice</i> and <i>Civil Rights: Rhetoric or Reality?</i> he questioned affirmative action and expressed frustration with government bureaucracy, elaborating on his ideas of personal freedom and responsibility in the process. In <i>A Personal Odyssey</i>, we're shown glimpses of the man behind the ideas, and while the narration is sometimes frustratingly distant, it's an enjoyable history of a fascinating man. Beginning with his early life in North Carolina, where his encounters with white people were so limited that he didn't really believe that "yellow" was a possible color for hair, Sowell details his childhood with humor and appreciation for the adults who raised him with love, attention, and high expectations. Throughout the experiences that follow, from the U.S. Marines to Howard and Harvard Universities to his fellowship at Stanford's Hoover Institute, Sowell's strong opinions make him stand out from the herd. His brother sums up this trait in describing Sowell's son: "Tommy, when I see a dozen kids, all doing the same thing, and in the midst of them is one kid doing something entirely different, I don't have to guess which one is our mother's grandson." You don't have to be familiar with Sowell's scholarly works to appreciate his life--this is a read for any freethinking iconoclast. <i>--Jill Lightner</i>Bestselling author <b>Thomas Sowell</b> has been on the faculties of leading universities across the country, an economist in the corporate world and in government, and a scholar in residence at three think tanks.

I set two Waterford tumblers square in the middle of the scarred oak kitchen table. I poured a fingerful of whiskey for Edna, my mother, who drinks hers neat, and one for myself, on the rocks with a little water. Solemnly, we clinked glasses.</p><p>Selah! said Edna.</p><p>Back at ya, I said.</p><p>She dealt herself a hand of solitaire. I went to the kitchen counter and fiddled with the radio until I found WABE, the local National Public Radio affiliate. Usually, we listen to the news this time of day, but today I was hunting for the station's annual all-Irish program.</p><p>As soon as I sat down I had to jump back up and turn off the radio. They were playing Danny Boy.</p><p>Edna gave me a quizzical look.</p><p>Not that one, I said. It's too early in the day. It always makes you cry.</p><p>She nodded thoughtfully. You could be right. It's better to work up to all these things. She slapped a row of cards facedown on the table. Although, she added, all those lousy songs get to me.</p><p>They remind you of Daddy?</p><p>She sighed. He sure loved St. Patrick's Day. Remember?</p><p>How could I forget? He used to make us dress all in green, head to toe. Then drag us over to Christ the King for Mass with the archbishop.</p><p>You kids marched in that parade every year from the time you were babies, Edna said. One year one of the Meehans brought a goat cart into town. You remember that? We piled all you kids in a damn goat cart and your daddy walked on one side of you and Billy Meehan walked on the other side, both of them grinning like idiots, and that goat prancing down Pharr Road like some kind of fine Arabian stallion.</p><p>I remember being in a cart, I said. The goat had a little straw hat with an Irish flag sticking out of the top. And Daddy bought us hot chocolate because it was so cold that day. And Maureen threw up all over my green plaid skirt, the little snot.</p><p>She always did have a weak stomach, Edna said, smiling. Go ahead and turn the radio back on. Maybe they'll play &#x2018;McNamara's Band.'</p><p>But they were playing Rose of Tralee, and Edna's eyes got suspiciously moist, so that she had to duck into the bathroom because, she claimed, she'd dribbled something down the front of her blouse. But she didn't come back for another five minutes, and when she did, she hadn't bothered to change her blouse, so I knew it was a ruse.</p><p>It started raining around six-thirty, softly at first. But soon rain started coming down in slashing gusts. I was standing at the back door, looking out at the lightning flashing and dancing on the horizon, when somebody banged at the front door.</p><p>Edna looked up from her cards. Get that, would you?</p><p>I almost didn't recognize our visitor, he was so changed from the last time I'd seen him.</p><p>Six-four, with dark hair slicked back from his forehead and a pair of stylish horned-rim glasses, he looked like a mutual-fund banker, not the slapdash cop I'd known for fifteen years or more.</p><p>Bucky?</p><p> Bucky Deavers pushed past me into the hallway. Christ! It's coming down in buckets out there.</p><p>He stood there, dripping rain onto the floor, until I came to my senses and took his coat. Under the raincoat he wore a forest green blazer, pleated khaki slacks, a crisp white shirt, and a shamrock-print necktie. He had a sprig of heather pinned to his jacket lapel.</p><p>Very nice, I said, motioning for him to turn around, which he did, ending with a little mock curtsy. Is this another of your phases?</p><p>We're going to a party, he said, grinning.</p><p>We? Who we?</p><p>We, as in you and me, he said.</p><p>The last party we'd been to together was a Halloween frolic at the Euclid Avenue Yacht Club, where he'd gone as Jackie Kennedy in drag.</p><p>Where's your pink pillbox hat? I asked.</p><p>At the dry cleaner's, he said. Blood spatters are hell to get out of pink. Come on, Garrity. Get going. We're late already.</p><p>What kind of party? I wanted to know.</p><p>Whaddya mean, what kind of party? Did you just resign from the Irish race, Garrity? It's St. Patrick's Day.</p><p>I know what day it is, I said. And that's why I'm staying home, where it's safe. You know my policy about this, Bucky.</p><p>Yeah, yeah, he said, waving his hand dismissively. St. Patrick's Day is amateur night. You wouldn't be caught dead in Buckhead, yada, yada, yada. But that's okay. We're not going anywhere near Buckhead. So get dressed, would you?</p><p>I looked down at my blue jeans and my blue work shirt. Supposing I were to go to this party with you. What's wrong with what I've got on?</p><p>He shook his head sadly. It's a party, for Christ's sake. You look like a refugee from a hippie commune. Come on, Garrity. You've got a pair of world-class gams under those jeans. Throw on a dress or skirt or something, would you? Something green, preferably.</p><p>I narrowed my eyes. What's the deal here, Bucky? Since when do you care how I dress?</p><p>He pushed me down the hall toward the kitchen. . .</p></p><h2>The Encyclopedia of Immaturity</h2><p>With 300+ entries (such as How to Do a Wheelie, How to Hang a Spoon from Your Nose, and How to Levitate), this compendium is the first book to teach an essential part of living right: never growing up.

The grand teacher of Pokï¿½mon introduces this handy book about the Japanese craze that took over America in the form of a video game, trading cards, and a popular TV show. The handbook--written as if the young reader were a Pokï¿½mon trainer like Ash, Misty, and Brock--teaches kids which cards are the best to win a game and illuminates the stories behind the TV show. Geared to young readers, this engaging, colorful book is not for the Pokï¿½mon expert who has copious spreadsheets of statistics. You'll find fun facts about each Pokï¿½mon (Charmander is two feet tall and its element is fire, in case you didn't know), a clear guide to the evolution of certain characters, and a helpful pronunciation guide (great for parents).

The poems embrace our connections while celebrating the joy of individuality, the power we each share to express our truest, deepest selves.

She was honored with the 2010 Lennon Ono Grant for Peace and has been inducted into the California Hall of Fame. She lives in the San Francisco Bay Area.Walker is of course well known as the author of the novel The Color Purple as well as other works of prose, but she has also published books of poetry throughout her career. Her poetic goals are more inspirational than literary. Poetry is, for her, a place to "share losses, health concerns, and other challenges common to the human condition," as she says in her preface; it is also a place to help heal those wounds. In narrow free verse, often with a single word on a line, Walker asks pertinent questions, such as, in "Watching You Hold Your Hatred," "Isn't it/ slippery?/ might you/ not/ someday/ drop it/ on/ yourself?" She also merges the personal and the political ("You'd be surprised/ to find/ how cleansing/ it feels/ to depose/ a/ dictator:/ There she is/ anticipating your/ every wish"); addresses a "Woman/ of color/ lighting up/ the/ dark"; and describes how love "is embedded in us,/ like seams of gold in the Earth."

He had a fine home, a family, and a successful career as an art professor and painter. Then, without warning, he found himself in hospital in excruciating pain, awaiting an emergency operation. He realized with horror that his death was a real possibility. Storm was totally unprepared for what was to happen next. He found himself out of his body, staring at his own physical form. But this was no hallucination; he was fully aware and felt more alive than ever before. In his spirit form, Storm was drawn into fearsome realms of darkness and death, where he experienced the terrible consequences of a life of selfishness and materialism. However, his journey also took him into regions of light where he conversed with angelic beings and the Lord of Light Himself, who sent him back to earth with a message of love. &#34;My Descent Into Death&#34; is Howard Storm&#39;s full story: from his near death experience in Paris to his full recovery back home in the United States, and the subsequent transformation of his life. Storm also communicates what he learned in his conversations with heavenly spiritual beings, revealing how the world will be in the future; the real meaning of life; what happens when we die; the role of angels, and much more. What he has to say will challenge those who believe that human awareness ends with death.</p><p></p><h2>Anguished English: An Anthology of Accidental Assaults upon Our Language</h2><p><p>Anguished English is the impossibly funny anthology of accidental assaults upon our common language.

In the tiny hamlet of Union Grove, New York, travel is horse-drawn and farming is back at the center of life. But it&#x2019;s no pastoral haven. Wars are fought over dwindling resources and illness is a constant presence. Bandits roam the countryside, preying on the weak. And a sinister cult threatens to shatter Union Grove&#x2019;s fragile stability.<br><br>In a book that is both shocking yet eerily convincing, Kunstler seamlessly weaves hot-button issues such as the decline of oil and the perils of climate change into a compelling narrative of violence, religious hysteria, innocence lost, and love found.</p><p>JAMES HOWARD KUNSTLER was born in New York City in 1948. He is the author of nine novels and four nonfiction books, including the bestselling <i>The Long Emergency</i>. After college he worked as a reporter and feature writer for a number of newspapers and finally as a staff writer for <i>Rolling Stone</i>. In 1975 he began writing books and lecturing full time.The post-oil America Kunstler envisioned in A World Made by Hand (2008) proved intriguing enough to inspire a sequel, which, in turn, portends a longer series. Having established the parameters of a society bereft of government services, automobiles, public utilities, consumer goods, and computers, Kunstler writes with more finesse in this portrayal of a community of survivors in Upstate New York, an old-fashioned yarn of character-building confrontations between humans and the wild, outlaws and decent folks. Kunstler decries our refusal to face facts about our oil habit, dramatizes how quickly &#x201c;the great thrumming engine of modernity&#x201d; can be halted, and celebrates the benefits of living intimately with nature. But his social concerns never overburden the suspenseful, darkly amusing story, with its touches of the fantastic in the mode of Washington Irving, or undermine his seductive characters: plucky young Jasper, the doctor&#x2019;s son; ludicrous bandit and psychopath Billy Bones; a sexy and accomplished witch; and the gruff leader of the bizarre and prosperous New Faith commune who possesses his own supernatural powers. Future installments will be eagerly anticipated. --Donna Seaman</p><h2>A Man and his Mountain: The Everyman who Created Kendall-Jackson and Became America&#x2019;s Greatest Wine Entrepreneur</h2><p><b>The story of self-made billionaire Jess Jackson, who put Chardonnay on America's tables as he built the Kendall&#x2013;Jackson wine empire from a few mountainous acres of grapes, and raced the Horse of the Year three years in a row, is a remarkable tale of romance, risk, and reinvention&#x2014;perhaps the greatest second act in the history of American business.</b><br><br>Jess Stonestreet Jackson was one of a small band of pioneering entrepreneurs who put California's Wine Country on the map. His life story is a compelling slice of history, daring, innovation, feuds, intrigue, talent, mystique, and luck. Admirers and detractors alike have called him the Steve Jobs of wine&#x2014;a brilliant, infuriating, contrarian gambler who seemed to win more than his share by anticipating consumers' desires with uncanny skill. Time after time his decisions would be ignored and derided, then envied and imitated as competitors struggled to catch up.<br><br>He founded Kendall&#x2013;Jackson with a single, tiny vineyard and a belief that there could be more to California Wine Country than jugs of bottom-shelf screw-top. Today, Kendall&#x2013;Jackson and its 14,000 acres of coastal and mountain vineyards produce a host of award-winning wines, including the most popular Chardonnay in the world, which was born out of a catastrophe that nearly broke Jackson. The empire Jackson built endures and thrives as a family-run leader of the American wine industry.<br><br>Jess Jackson entered the horseracing game just as dramatically. He brought con men to justice, exposed industry-wide corruption in court and Congress, then exacted the best revenge of all: race after race, he defied conventional wisdom with one high-stakes winner after another, capped by the epic season of Rachel Alexandra, the first filly to win the Preakness in nearly a century, cementing Jackson's reputation as America's king of wine and horses.<br></p><p><b>Edward Humes</b> is a Pulitzer Prize&#x2013;winning journalist and author of twelve other nonfiction books, including <i>No Matter How Loud I Shout: A Year in the Life of Juvenile Court</i>, a PEN Award recipient; <i>Mississippi Mud</i>; <i>Force of Nature: The Unlikely Story of Wal-Mart's Green Revolution</i>; <i>Garbology: Our Dirty Love Affair with Trash</i>; and <i>School of Dreams</i>, named by the <i>Washington Post</i> as a best book of the year. His writings have appeared in many publications, including the <i>New York Times</i>, <i>Wall Street Journal</i>, <i>Los Angeles Times</i>, <i>Forbes</i>, and <i>Sierra</i>.<br><br>Jess Jackson wriggled into his half-wetsuit, threw on an air tank, regulator, and mask, and plunged into the vineyard&#x2019;s dark reservoir. The icy water burned his exposed arms and legs. He could see nothing under the surface dawn was still hours away. He&#x2019;d have to feel along the slimy bottom of the pond until he found the weeds and algae that had clogged the irrigation pumps, then rip them loose so the reservoir waters could once again flow to the vines.<br><br>His big hands reduced to clumsy clubs by the cold, he tried not to panic as he felt around with numbed fingers. He knew time was not on his side. The banks of drippers and sprayers in the fields could protect the grapes from fatal frost. Liquid water soon froze once sprayed on the vines, but that was good: it insulated the fragile fruit, forming a barrier between the grapes and the much colder air temperature that would burn and ruin the crop. But the vital pumps had clogged, the protective waters were not flowing, it was the middle of the night, and there was no one but this middle-aged lawyer and part-time vintner there to do something about the incessant frost alarm. Jackson knew he either could complete this crazy, bone chilling dive and risk possible hypothermia to save his fledgling vineyard, or he could walk away, go sit by the fire, and lose the farm in a matter of hours. As in, literally, lose the farm.<br><br>In truth, this wasn&#x2019;t much of a debate for Jackson. In a crisis he preferred offense to defense, whatever the consequences punching rather than rolling with the punches. His years working as a policeman, an ambulance driver, a lumberjack, a gambler, and assorted other risky and dicey careers had convinced him of that much a resumï¿½ that, years later, would make him a unique entry on <i>Forbes&#x2019;</i> list of the world&#x2019;s wealthiest men. So he had raced to rummage through the storeroom where he had stashed his diving rig. No one else in the family had been quite sure why he had hauled all this junk up to the farm. Now it seemed there had been a method to the madness, as he told his wide-eyed daughter, I&#x2019;m going in.&#x201d;</p><h2>Acts: Seeing the Spirit at Work (John Stott Bible Studies)</h2><p>The Spirit moved in dramatic ways in the early church.

The suns, one yellow and one orange, were high overhead. Anyone glancing up from the road toward either ridge would only see glare.<br>The perfect time and place for an ambush.<br>The day was cool and a breeze blew steadily. Still, sweat trickled down Nathan&#x2019;s face. Nerves, he told himself, knowing that was at best a half truth.<br>With the barrel of his laser rifle, he nudged aside a frond for a clearer look. (The fern was green, clearly terrestrial. Across the rugged gorge where the second group of rebels hid, the red-gold vegetation was as plainly native.) Ruts and potholes scarred the primitive road: no obstacle for antigrav vehicles, but scarcely navigable for anything with wheels.<br>He wasn&#x2019;t afraid, not exactly. Fear would have required truly believing that this was happening, that he was here.<br>Life had been that way, surreal, since the missile punched through Clementine. The emergency restraints in the pilot&#x2019;s couch had saved him. Everyone else aboard died when the ship broke apart. Resistance fighters reached the wreckage first. Deep in shock, unquestioningly, he had gone with them.<br>He took small, measured sips from his canteen. He took deep, cleansing breaths. When neither calmed him, he looked skyward for serenity, at the birds and their native equivalents soaring effortlessly in the thermals that rose from the plain. That didn&#x2019;t work, either.<br>In the Resistance camp he had drawn plenty of sideways glances. The rebels didn&#x2019;t fully trust him&#x2014;yet here he was. Maybe they had chosen not to leave him behind unguarded. Maybe, finally, they felt comfortable with him. Or maybe they wanted to see if he would bolt into the jungle given the chance. (Would they have let him go? He didn&#x2019;t think so.)<br>One way or another, his presence here was a test.<br>A faint droning drifted Nathan&#x2019;s way, and hints of metallic clanking. Over the plain below, in the far distance where jungle still hid the road, a cloud of brown dust now hovered.<br>Their target approached.<br>The aristos controlled space around Wunderland more completely every day. Nathan&#x2014;and even more so, his former crew&#x2014;had learned that the hard way. Snoopersats might intercept even the briefest radio whisper. And so from Nathan&#x2019;s left, where Logan, the leader of this guerrilla band, lay hidden, the most basic of signals: a soft avian trill.<br>Get ready.<br>Nathan whistled an acknowledgment as best he could, not knowing what he tried to imitate. More &#x201c;birdsong&#x201d; to his right and from across the gorge. The guerrillas wore camouflage over their improvised armor; even with their whistles to guide him, he spotted no one. Seven answers in all, including Nathan&#x2019;s own.<br>The crossfire would be deadly.<br>Reviewing what had passed for training&#x2014;mostly &#x201c;If it reflects, don&#x2019;t shoot it&#x201d; and &#x201c;If you see them, assume they see you&#x201d;&#x2014;Nathan raised the laser rifle to his shoulder. (There had been a lesson, too, on improvising explosive devices from house hold chemicals. Making bombs scared the hell out of him, and he tried his best to leave that knowledge theoretical. Seeing his hands shake, others had built the explosives now hidden in the ravine far below.) Through the scope he followed the barely-a-path across the rocky plain below. Not-quite trees swayed where the road entered the lower jungle.<br>The first vehicles emerged: tractors, cargo floaters, flatbed trucks. Civilian vehicles, all. People jammed the truck beds, balanced precariously on the sideboards, plodded alongside on foot. Another few minutes would bring the caravan into the canyon. Into the trap.<br>Birds circled high overhead, indistinct against the suns&#x2019; glare. Their presence, perhaps, signified nothing.<br>In his mind&#x2019;s eye they were vultures.<br>Cranking up the magnification Nathan saw more women and children than men. Everyone kept glancing fearfully over their shoulders. He saw a few dogs and even a sway-backed horse. Here and there people clutched hunting rifles, but that didn&#x2019;t make them the enemy. Who would venture into this wilderness unarmed?<br>He zoomed closer still, examined weary faces. Half the adults looked old. Boosterspice was plentiful, if pricey; to look old meant you were poor. Most men&#x2019;s chins were stubbled, but of asymmetric, pointy-on-one-side/close-cropped-on-the-other beards, Nathan saw not a one. Only Wunderland&#x2019;s aristos sported those ridiculous, high-maintenance affectations as symbols of indolence and leisure.<br>This couldn&#x2019;t be the rumored garrison resupply convoy. Nathan waited for the call to stand down. Instead, from his left, a brief chittering.<br>On my signal.<br>Madness! These were civilian refugees. Poor farmers by the look of them and of their vehicles. Why the tanj ambush them? Nathan cleared his throat.<br>&#x201c;Quiet!&#x201d; Logan hissed.<br>For the first time since getting stranded, Nathan wondered if one side was any better than another.<br>Be honest, he chided himself. The second time. The first time was when two guerrillas marched a third, her face bruised, the cloth badge of the Resistance ripped from her blouse, out of camp into the jungle. Only the men, their expressions grim, had returned.<br>Nathan had chosen to believe they had sent her away. These people had pulled him from the wreck, whisked him away before Internal Security arrived. He owed the guerrillas everything, from the shirt on his back to his very life.<br>Now he wondered if he could live with the debt.<br>As the hum of engines swelled, Nathan&#x2019;s mind churned. Join in the slaughter? Never. Stand by, doing nothing, and watch? How was that better?<br>There had to be another way. A warning shot to scare off the civilians? No. The laser beam between plain and cliff top would point back at him. That woman vanished into the woods outside camp . . . Nathan had a pretty good idea how the Resistance treated sympathizers. Or&#x2014;<br>Probably no one was looking up. Nathan raised his rifle and fired. With a squawk a bird stopped its circling. Gravity here was scarcely half that to which Nathan was accustomed, and the bird, cut almost in two, fell in slow motion.<br>Splat went the carcass, just ahead of the caravan.<br>The people on foot turned and ran, zigzagging, back toward the trees. Engines raced. Vehicles jerked into reverse or turned off the road to circle back. Maybe he had saved a few&#x2014;<br>Crash! A tractor and a truck collided, blocking the way into the jungle.<br>&#x201c;Now!&#x201d; shouted Logan.<br>From both canyon rims guerrillas opened fire. Laser beams, silent, scythed down three men before anyone below noticed. Then: screams. Curses. More bodies crumpling. Chaos.<br>It was a massacre, sickening&#x2014;<br>Sudden motion behind the slaughter. Sleek and sharklike, three antigrav gunships burst from the jungle, their charge spookily silent. Laser cannon blazed bloodred. As the gunships neared, their railguns let loose.<br>The guerrillas launched their only two surface-to-air missiles. One hit. Trailing smoke, its engine stuttering, a gunship arced down, down, down. . . . It smashed&#x2014;boom!&#x2014;into a cliff face, and the ground shook. Across the gorge two men more brave than sane (&#x201c;If you see them, assume they see you!&#x201d;) kept firing. The remaining gunships spewed their own missiles.<br>No one could have survived those blasts.<br>&#x201c;Fall back!&#x201d; Logan shouted.<br>At least Nathan, his ears ringing, decided that was the order. He was already slithering backward, away from the precipice and deeper into the jungle, as quickly as he could.<br>He had done what he could for the refugees. The thought offered no comfort.<br>The caravan was doubly bait. The militia had used civilians to entice the Resistance. The guerrillas, just as callous, had attacked the refugees to lure an aristo patrol into reach.<br>Blam! Blam-blam!<br>More missiles. The ground slammed Nathan, flung him high into the air. He came down stunned. Through the underbrush, backlit by explosions, he glimpsed a profile. It loomed over him, well over two meters tall. What with the low gravity, most Wunderlanders were gigantic.<br>One of the guerrillas. Cody something. Was he here to help Nathan or kill him?<br>&#x201c;Come on,&#x201d; Cody growled. Maybe he hadn&#x2019;t seen Nathan warn the refugees. &#x201c;Time to go.&#x201d;<br>As Nathan struggled to his feet, another blast bounced him off a tree trunk. His left arm and some ribs snapped. And something molten had spattered his camo. It ate through the cloth, through his body armor. The bellow of railguns swallowed his scream.<br>Cody sprayed first-aid foam over the hole in Nathan&#x2019;s vest and his side went numb. The Wunderlander helped Nathan to his feet and together they staggered into the jungle.<br>A YELLOW OVAL GLEAMED on the sloping roof. Not a sun, Nathan gradually decided. The glow of a lamp, reflected on . . . what? How long had he been staring at the glow and why were his thoughts so fuzzy?<br>He looked around. He was flat on his back on one narrow cot among many. All the cots were filled, most by people wearing bloody bandages. He remembered the jungle being eerily quiet. Now that dubious honor belonged to this . . . ?<br>First-aid ward, he decided. In a futzy cave. Geological time later, he figured it out: body heat. Snoopersats would zero in on any camp this size in the wild.<br>He didn&#x2019;t remember getting here. Cody had carried Nathan out, then.<br>Had anyone else among the guerrillas made it? Nathan sat up, the better to check the other beds. He noticed his cast before trying to put any weight on that arm.<br>But he had forgotten about the ribs and the burn. He gasped. The one person standing&#x2014;a medic?&#x2014;was tweaking the flow rate on a drip bag. She turned her head. &#x201c;Be with you in a minute, soldier.&#x201d;<br>Drip bag. Cast. Bloody ta...</p><h2>Billy the Kid: A Short and Violent Life</h2><p>Whatever his name or alias at the moment&#x2014;Henry McCarty, Henry Antrim, Kid Antrim, Billy Bonney&#x2014;people always called him the Kid. Not until his final month did anyone call him Billy the Kid. Newspapers pictured him as a king of outlaws; and his highly publicized capture, trial, escape, and end fixed his image in the public mind for all time. He was only twenty-one years old when a bullet from Sheriff Pat Garett&#x2019;s six-shooter killed him on July 14, 1881. Within a year Billy the Kid became the subject of five dime-novel &#x201c;biographies&#x201d; as well as Garett&#x2019;s ghost-written account, and that was just the beginning.&nbsp;Robert M. Utley does what countless books, movies, television shows, musical compositions, and paintings have failed to do: he successfully strips off the veneer of legendry to expose the reality of Billy the Kid. Using previously untapped sources, he presents an engrossing story&#x2014;the most complete and accurate ever&#x2014;of a youthful hoodlum and sometime killer who found his calling in New Mexico&#x2019;s bloody power struggle known as the Lincoln County War. In unmasking the legend Utley also tells us much about our heritage of frontier vigilantism and violence.</p><p>One of the preeminent western historians writing today, Robert M. Utley is the author of <i>High Noon in Lincoln: Violence on the Western Frontier</i>, <i>Cavalier in Buckskin: George Armstrong Custer and the Western Military Frontier</i> and <i>The Lance and the Shield: The Life and Times of Sitting Bull</i>, as well as <i>Frontier Regulars: The United States Army and the Indian, 1848&#x2013;1865</i> (1984) and <i>Frontiersmen in Blue: The United States Army and the Indian, 1866&#x2013;1891</i> (1981) published by the University of Nebraska Press.Most Americans are familiar with the legend of the outlaw William H. Bonney, better known as Billy the Kid. Utley, a noted historian of the Old West, has written a scholarly biography of the Kid, which--as does all good biography--incorporates the history of his times. Using interviews conducted with the Kid's contemporaries, Utley draws a portrait of a youth who, while not the bloodthirsty killer painted by newspapers of the period, was not a Western Robin Hood, either. Utley concludes: "Except in its final months . . . the Kid's career did not measure up to his reputation. Although a superb gunman and arresting personality, he was a quite ordinary outlaw . . . ." While Pat Garrett's The Authentic Life of Billy the Kid (Univ. of Oklahoma Pr., 1954. o.p.; 1986. pap.) is useful for its contemporary portrait, public and academic libraries serving clients with an interest in the period or the region will want this title.<br><i>- Sue Kamm, Los Angeles P.L.</i><br>Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>A Problem from Hell: America and the Age of Genocide</h2><p><p> In her award-winning interrogation of the last century of American history, Samantha Power&#x2014;a former Balkan war correspondent and founding executive director of Harvard's Carr Center for Human Rights Policy&#x2014;asks the haunting question: Why do American leaders who vow "never again" repeatedly fail to stop genocide? Drawing upon exclusive interviews with Washington's top policy makers, access to newly declassified documents, and her own reporting from the modern killing fields, Power provides the answer in <i>"A Problem from Hell,"</i> a groundbreaking work that tells the stories of the courageous Americans who risked their careers and lives in an effort to get the United States to act. </p></p><p>During the three years (1993-1996) Samantha Power spent covering the grisly events in Bosnia and Srebrenica, she became increasingly frustrated with how little the United States was willing to do to counteract the genocide occurring there. After much research, she discovered a pattern: "The United States had never in its history intervened to stop genocide and had in fact rarely even made a point of condemning it as it occurred," she writes in this impressive book. Debunking the notion that U.S. leaders were unaware of the horrors as they were occurring against Armenians, Jews, Cambodians, Iraqi Kurds, Rwandan Tutsis, and Bosnians during the past century, Power discusses how much was known and when, and argues that much human suffering could have been alleviated through a greater effort by the U.S. She does not claim that the U.S. alone could have prevented such horrors, but does make a convincing case that even a modest effort would have had significant impact. Based on declassified information, private papers, and interviews with more than 300 American policymakers, Power makes it clear that a lack of political will was the most significant factor for this failure to intervene. Some courageous U.S. leaders did work to combat and call attention to ethnic cleansing as it occurred, but the vast majority of politicians and diplomats ignored the issue, as did the American public, leading Power to note that "no U.S. president has ever suffered politically for his indifference to its occurrence. It is thus no coincidence that genocide rages on." This powerful book is a call to make such indifference a thing of the past. <i>--Shawn Carkonen</i><p> Samantha Power is a foreign policy columnist at <i>Time</i> magazine.

The ship was laid in 1937, commissioned just seven months before Pearl Harbor, and decommissioned after seven very active years. Washington saw service in the North Atlantic, then in all the major campaigns of the Pacific. Musicant, using primarily the ship's log and interviews with dozens of crewmen, has put together an absorbing chronicle of naval war. This is shipboard history; anything that didn't happen on or to the Washington gets short shrift. Musicant is also the author of a history of armored cruisers.

She&#x2019;s been the bulwark of my existence, the foundation I was built on, and the best mother a woman could have.</p><p><b>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</b></p><p>A tip of the hat to Anastasia Luettecke, who was a perfectionist in supplying me with Octavia&#x2019;s Latin. And thanks to Murv Sellars for being the go-between. As always, I owe a great debt of thanks to Toni L. P. Kelner and Dana Cameron for their valuable comments and the gift of their time. My one and only minion, Debi Murray, assisted me with her encyclopedic knowledge of the Sookie universe. The group of enthusiastic readers known as Charlaine&#x2019;s Charlatans gave me moral (and morale) support, and I hope this book will serve as their reward.</p><p><i>If this was The Lord of the Rings and I had a smart British</i> voice like Cate Blanchett, I could tell you the background of the events of that fall in a really suspenseful way. And you&#x2019;d be straining to hear the rest.</p><p>But what happened in my little corner of northwest Louisiana wasn&#x2019;t an epic story. The vampire war was more of the nature of a small-country takeover, and the Were war was like a border skirmish. Even in the annals of supernatural America&#x2014;I guess they exist somewhere&#x2014;they were minor chapters . . . unless you were actively involved in the takeovers and skirmishes.</p><p>Then they became pretty damn major.</p><p>And everything was due to Katrina, the disaster that just kept on spreading grief, woe, and permanent change in its wake.</p><p>Before Hurricane Katrina, Louisiana had a flourishing vampire community. In fact, the vampire population of New Orleans had burgeoned, making it the place to go if you wanted to see vampires; and lots of Americans did. The undead jazz clubs, featuring musicians no one had seen playing in public in decades, were special draws. Vamp strip clubs, vamp psychics, vamp sex acts; secret and not-so-secret places where you could get bitten and have an orgasm on the spot: all this was available in southern Louisiana.</p><p>In the northern part of the state . . . not so much. I live in the northern part in a small town called Bon Temps. But even in my area, where vamps are relatively thin on the ground, the undead were making economic and social strides.</p><p>All in all, vampire business in the Pelican State was booming. But then came the death of the King of Arkansas while his wife, the Queen of Louisiana, was entertaining him soon after their wedding. Since the corpse vanished and all the witnesses&#x2014; except me&#x2014;were supernaturals, human law took no notice. But the other vampires did, and the queen, Sophie-Anne Leclerq, landed in a very dicey legal position. Then came Katrina, which wiped out the financial base of Sophie-Anne&#x2019;s empire. Still, the queen was floundering back from those disasters, when another one followed hard on their heels. Sophie-Anne and some of her strongest adherents&#x2014;and me, Sookie Stackhouse, telepath and human&#x2014;were caught in a terrible explosion in Rhodes, the destruction of the vampire hotel called the Pyramid of Gizeh. A splinter group of the Fellowship of the Sun claimed responsibility, and while the leaders of that anti-vampire &#x201c;church&#x201d; decried the hate crime, everyone knew that the Fellowship was hardly agonizing over those who were terribly wounded in the blast, much less over the (finally, absolutely) dead vampires or the humans who served them.</p><p>Sophie-Anne lost her legs, several members of her entourage, and her dearest companion. Her life was saved by her half-demon lawyer, Mr. Cataliades. But her recuperation time was going to be lengthy, and she was in a position of terrible vulnerability.</p><p>What part did I play in all this?</p><p>I&#x2019;d helped save lives after the pyramid went down, and I was terrified I was now on the radar of people who might want me to spend my time in their service, using my telepathy for their purposes. Some of those purposes were good, and I wouldn&#x2019;t mind lending a hand in rescue services from time to time, but I wanted to keep my life to myself. I was alive; my boyfriend, Quinn, was alive; and the vampires most important to me had survived, too. As far as the troubles Sophie-Anne faced, the political consequences of the attack and the fact that supernatural groups were circling the weakened state of Louisiana like hyenas around a dying gazelle ... I didn&#x2019;t think about it at all.</p><p>I had other stuff on my mind, personal stuff. I&#x2019;m not used to thinking much further than the end of my fingertips; that&#x2019;s my only excuse. Not only was I not thinking about the vampire situation, there was another supernatural situation I didn&#x2019;t ponder that turned out to be just as crucial to my future.</p><p>Close to Bon Temps, in Shreveport, there&#x2019;s a Were pack whose ranks are swollen by the men and women from Barksdale Air Force Base. During the past year, this Were pack had become sharply divided between two factions. I&#x2019;d learned in American History what Abraham Lincoln, quoting the Bible, had to say about houses divided.</p><p>To assume that these two situations would work themselves out, to fail to foresee that their resolution would involve me, well ... that was where I was almost fatally blind. I&#x2019;m telepathic, not psychic. Vampire minds are big relaxing blanks to me. Weres are difficult to read, though not impossible. That&#x2019;s my only excuse for being unaware of the trouble brewing all around me.</p><p>What was I so busy thinking about? Weddings&#x2014;and my missing boyfriend.</p><p><b>Chapter 1</b></p><p><i>I was making a neat arrangement of liquor bottles on the</i> folding table behind the portable bar when Halleigh Robinson rushed up, her normally sweet face flushed and tear-streaked. Since she was supposed to be getting married within an hour and was still wearing blue jeans and a T-shirt, she got my immediate attention.</p><p>&#x201c;Sookie!&#x201d; she said, rounding the bar to grab my arm. &#x201c;You have to help me.&#x201d;</p><p>I&#x2019;d already helped her by putting on my bartending clothes instead of the pretty dress I&#x2019;d planned on wearing. &#x201c;Sure,&#x201d; I said, imagining Halleigh wanted me to make her a special drink&#x2014; though if I&#x2019;d listened in to her thoughts, I&#x2019;d have known differently already. However, I was trying to be on my best behavior, and I was shielding like crazy. Being telepathic is no picnic, especially at a high-tension event like a double wedding. I&#x2019;d expected to be a guest instead of a bartender. But the caterer&#x2019;s bartender had been in a car wreck on her way over from Shreveport, and Sam, who&#x2019;d been unhired when E(E)E had insisted on using their own bartender, was abruptly hired again.</p><p>I was a little disappointed to be on the working side of the bar, but you had to oblige the bride on her special day. &#x201c;What can I do for you?&#x201d; I asked.</p><p>&#x201c;I need you to be my bridesmaid,&#x201d; she said.</p><p>&#x201c;Ah . . . what?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Tiffany fainted after Mr. Cumberland took the first round of pictures. She&#x2019;s on her way to the hospital.&#x201d;</p><p>It was an hour before the wedding, and the photographer had been trying to get a number of group shots out of the way. The bridesmaids and the groomsmen were already togged out. Halleigh should have been getting into her wedding finery, but instead here she was in jeans and curlers, no makeup, and a tear-streaked face.</p><p>Who could resist that?</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re the right size,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;And Tiffany is probably just about to have her appendix out. So, can you try on the dress?&#x201d;</p><p>I glanced at Sam, my boss.</p><p>Sam smiled at me and nodded. &#x201c;Go on, Sook. We don&#x2019;t officially open for business until after the wedding.&#x201d;</p><p>So I followed Halleigh into Belle Rive, the Bellefleur mansion, recently restored to something like its antebellum glory. The wooden floors gleamed, the harp by the stairs shone with gilt, the silverware displayed on the big sideboard in the dining room glowed with polishing. There were servers in white coats buzzing around everywhere, the E(E)E logo on their tunics done in an elaborate black script. Extreme(ly Elegant) Events had become the premier upscale caterer in the United States. I felt a stab in my heart when I noticed the logo, because my missing guy worked for the supernatural branch of E(E)E. I didn&#x2019;t have long to feel the ache, though, because Halleigh was dragging me up the stairs at a relentless pace.</p><p>The first bedroom at the top was full of youngish women in gold-colored dresses, all fussing around Halleigh&#x2019;s soon-to-be sister-in-law, Portia Bellefleur. Halleigh zoomed past that door to enter the second room on the left. It was equally full of younger women, but these were in midnight blue chiffon. The room was in chaos, with the bridesmaids&#x2019; civilian clothes piled here and there. There was a makeup and hair station over by the west wall, staffed by a stoic woman in a pink smock, curling rod in her hand.</p><p>Halleigh tossed introductions through the air like paper pellets. &#x201c;Gals, this is Sookie Stackhouse. Sookie, this is my sister Fay, my cousin Kelly, my best friend Sarah, my other best friend Dana. And here&#x2019;s the dress. It&#x2019;s an eight.&#x201d;</p><p>I was amazed that Halleigh had had the presence of mind to divest Tiffany of the bridesmaid dress before her departure for the hospital. Brides are ruthless. In a matter of minutes, I was stripped down to the essentials. I was glad I&#x2019;d worn nice underwear, since there wasn&#x2019;t any time for modesty. How embarrassing it would have been to be in granny panties with holes! The dress was lined, so I didn&#x2019;t need a slip, another stroke of luck. There was a spare pair of thigh-highs, which I pulled on, and then the dress went over my head. Sometimes I wear a ten&#x2014;in fact, most of the time&#x2014;so I was holding my breath while Fay zipped it up.</p><p>If I didn&#x2019;t breathe a lot, it would be okay.</p><p>&#x201c;Super!&#x201d; one of the other women (Dana?) said with great happiness. &#x201c;Now the shoes.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, God,&#x201d; I said when I saw them. They were very high heels dyed to match the midnight blue dress, and I slid my feet into them, anticipating pain. Kelly (maybe) buckled the straps, and I stood up. All of us held our breath as I took a step, then another. They were about half a size too small. It was an important half.</p><p>&#x201c;I can get through the wedding,&#x201d; I said, and they all clapped.</p><p>"Over here then,&#x201d; said Pink Smock, and I sat in her chair and had more makeup reapplied over my own and my hair redone while the real bridesmaids and Halleigh&#x2019;s mother assisted Halleigh into her dress. Pink Smock had a lot of hair to work with. I&#x2019;ve only had light trims in the past three years, I guess, and it&#x2019;s way down past my shoulder blades now. My roommate, Amelia, had put some highlights in, and that had turned out real good. I was blonder than ever.</p><p>I examined myself in the full-length mirror, and it seemed impossible I could have been so transformed in twenty minutes. From working barmaid in a white ruffled tux shirt and black trousers to bridesmaid in a midnight blue dress&#x2014;and three inches taller, to boot.</p><p>Hey, I looked<i> great.</i> The dress was a super color for me, the skirt was gently A-line, the short sleeves weren&#x2019;t too tight, and it wasn&#x2019;t low cut enough to look slutty. With my boobs, the slut factor kicks in if I&#x2019;m not careful.</p><p>I was yanked out of self-admiration by the practical Dana, who said, &#x201c;Listen, here&#x2019;s the drill.&#x201d; From that moment on, I listened and nodded. I examined a little diagram. I nodded some more. Dana was one organized gal. If I ever invaded a small country, this was the woman I wanted on my side.</p><p>By the time we made our way carefully down the stairs (long skirts and high heels, not a good combination), I was fully briefed and ready for my first trip down the aisle as a bridesmaid.</p><p>Most girls have done this a couple of times before they reach twenty-six, but Tara Thornton, the only friend I had close enough to ask me, had up and eloped while I was out of town.</p><p>The other wedding party was assembled downstairs when we descended. Portia&#x2019;s group would precede Halleigh&#x2019;s. The two grooms and their groomsmen were already outside if all was going smoothly, because now it was fi...</p></p><h2>THE FLIGHT OF THE WILD GANDER- EXPLORATIONS IN THE MYTHOLOGICAL DIMENSION</h2><p>In these essays, Joseph Campbell explores the origins of myth and their role in everyday life - from Grimm fairy tales to Native American legends. He explains how the symbolic content of myth is linked to universal human experience and how myths and experiences change over time. Included is his acclaimed essay &#34;Mythogenesis,&#34; which examines the rise and fall of a Native American legend. &#34;Campbell has become one of the rarest of intellectuals ... a serious thinker who has been embraced by the popular culture.&#34;</p><p>The origins and symbolisms of mythology over time, as revealed by Joseph Campbell.Joseph Campbell was an American author and teacher best known for his work in the field of comparative mythology. He was born in New York City in 1904, and from early childhood he became interested in mythology. He loved to read books about American Indian cultures and frequently visited the American Museum of Natural History in New York, where he was fascinated by the museum&#x2019;s collection of totem poles. Campbell was educated at Columbia University, where he specialized in medieval literature, and, after earning a master&#x2019;s degree, continued his studies at universities in Paris and Munich. Throughout his life, he traveled extensively and wrote prolifically, authoring many books, including the four-volume series The Masks of God, Myths to Live By, The Inner Reaches of Outer Space, and A Skeleton Key to Finnegans Wake.

Called &#39;the uttermost part of the Earth&#39;, Patagonia is the stretch of land at the southern tip of South America.

From Rio Negro to the southernmost town of Ushuaia, Chatwin depicts all in writing as spare as the Patagonian desert itself, and as vibrant as the purple clouds off Last Hope Sound.BRUCE CHATWIN reinvented British travel writing with his first book, <i>In Patagonia</i>, and followed it with four other books, each unique and extraordinary.

My favorite pastime was chewing on my crib because I seemed to like the taste of varnish so much. I chewed so hard, and with such great determination, that chew marks were left all over the wooden rails of my crib.<br> <br>I was sturdy, adventurous, and unafraid. When I was four years old, and playing in the family-owned Jones brewery, my grandfather promised me jelly beans if I drank some beer. I jumped at the opportunity, tried the beer, and hated it.<br> <br>But I loved the brewery, and everything about it, primarily because it was my haven, my second home. My father, Paul Jones, and his brothers ran the Smithton, Pennsylvania, brewery, and from the time when I was three years old and we moved from Charleroi, Pennsylvania, where I was born, I spent much of my childhood there, playing hide-and-seek among the beer vats and the ice lockers, while my father&#x2019;s employees all held their breath, terrified that I would accidentally lock myself in a freezer and emerge as a pint-size ice sculpture!<br> <br>The Jones Brewing Company employed at least half of Smithton (population only 800), and it was started by my grandfather William B. Jones, who hailed from Wales. He immigrated to Pennsylvania, became a coal miner, worked himself to the bone, and saved enough money to buy a corner building in the little town of Smithton, a Norman Rockwell painting in living color. Then he converted that building into a small hotel with six rooms and called it the Jones Hotel. He was the bartender, and my grandmother Lulu did everything else necessary to make the hotel run smoothly.<br> <br>The official story, the one that I grew up knowing by heart, was that the hotel was so successful my grandfather bought a building on a beautiful site on the Youghiogheny River, which flowed through Smithton, joined the Monongahela River, and then ran right into Pittsburgh, twenty-one miles away. In 1907, in that riverside building, he founded the Jones Brewing Company.<br> <br>The unofficial story, one that I heard years later, was that William B. Jones, my grandfather, actually won the brewery in a poker game! According to that tale, the brewery had originally been based in Sutersville, Pennsylvania, and manufactured Eureka beer. After my grandfather won the brewery in 1907, he renamed it the Jones Brewing Company and moved it to Smithton.<br> <br>Whatever the truth, I&#x2019;m sure of one thing, the origin of the name of Jones brewery&#x2019;s most beloved beer. According to family lore, one of my grandfather&#x2019;s earliest customers was an African-American man who regularly visited the brewery along with his bulldog, Stoney.<br> <br>My grandfather grew to love that dog so much that after the dog died, he declared, &#x201c;From now on, my name is Stoney Jones.&#x201d; And he named the beer he brewed Stoney&#x2019;s beer after the dog he loved so much.<br> <br>Since then, the Jones Brewing Company, Stoney&#x2019;s beer, and Stoney&#x2019;s Light beer have been featured in the movie Striking Distance, starring Bruce Willis, and in the TV shows Northern Exposure and My Name Is Earl.<br> <br>Although I never knew my grandfather well, I inherited his love of animals and, as a child, raised mice, birds, squirrels, and had no fear of snakes or spiders. No fear whatsoever. In fact, my biggest ambition was to become a vet and look after animals of all types and sizes. Then, fate took a hand and I became something quite different.<br> <br>My grandfather died of diabetes aged only fifty-six, after having his leg amputated, rumor had it, because he drank too much beer. Sometime before he died, he tried to reverse his diabetes by instructing that Stoney&#x2019;s beer be manufactured without sugar. Sadly, that didn&#x2019;t help, and he died anyway. Nonetheless, even today, Stoney&#x2019;s beer is still manufactured without sugar or preservatives.<br> <br>After my grandfather&#x2019;s untimely death, my formidable grandmother Lulu inherited the Jones brewery, and my father and his brothers ran it for her.<br> <br>Despite his responsibilities, my father was a relaxed, generous, and happy man, with a heart of gold. From the first, he was the love of my life. When I was in the crib and screamed until it felt as if my lungs would burst, he would immediately rush into my nursery at top speed, lift me high in his strong, muscular arms, then place me on his barrel chest, whereupon I would promptly fall into a deep, contented sleep.<br> <br>In contrast, my mother never came to my rescue when I screamed. She just let me go on screaming and screaming. She was much too busy running our home, or entertaining guests. But while my father was always the life and soul of the party, my mother was not.<br> <br>Her name was Marjorie, and she was born Williams, of English descent. Her father was a telephone lineman, she had two sisters, and when she met my father, she fell in love with him at first sight.<br> <br>That love was to last a lifetime, but from as far back as I can remember, my mother continually appeared to be suffering from a deep and abiding disappointment. As I grew older and got to know my mother better, it became eminently clear to me that when she married my father, of the Jones Brewing Company, she had expected far more out of life and, forever afterward, desperately longed to get out of Smithton and move into the big city.<br> <br>But despite my mother&#x2019;s unfulfilled expectations, she loved my father unconditionally and adored him unreservedly. I never saw her fight with him, and even though he sometimes came home drunk, I never saw her get angry with him. Drunk as he was, she would undress him, get him ready for bed, and take care of him without a word of complaint. Looking back through the years, I realize that because from the time when I was a small child I watched my mother display such love and tolerance toward my father, her example unconsciously formed my own attitude toward men, in general, and to my first and second husbands, in particular.<br> <br>My father was away from home a great deal, traveling from Pittsburgh-area saloon to saloon, selling Stoney&#x2019;s beer. Now and again, to my joy and excitement, he would scoop me up and take me with him on his travels. Together, we would drive through the countryside in his gray Chevy, talking away, drinking in the beauty of the Pennsylvania countryside.<br> <br>Our route always took us over one particular bridge across the Youghiogheny River, through farmland where cattle and horses peacefully grazed. My father would invariably stop the car and just sit there, gazing at the animals. &#x201c;They are so beautiful, Shirley,&#x201d; he would say, &#x201c;so beautiful.&#x201d; Witnessing my father&#x2019;s deep reverence for animals and for nature bequeathed to me an enduring love for animals and nature, as well.<br> <br>Once we arrived at a saloon, he would sell cases of Stoney&#x2019;s beer to the saloon owner, then go up to the bar, put up a sign, BUY STONEY&#x2019;S BEER, and place beers for everyone at the bar, while I played on the pinball machine to my heart&#x2019;s content.<br> <br>I couldn&#x2019;t help noticing that wherever we went, women were all over my father. He was such a handsome man. Years later, I once asked him if he had ever cheated on my mother, and he smiled and said, &#x201c;I just played at it. I patted a few asses now and again, but I didn&#x2019;t do more than that.&#x201d; And I believed him.<br> <br>He was kind and loving, perhaps because he was the youngest son and had grown up very loved by his mother, Lulu, my grandmother.<br> <br>After my grandfather died, my grandmother became the matriarch of the family. My mother and father and I lived with her in a fourteen-room brick house on the corner of Second Street in Smithton. The house had a huge front porch, which ran half the length of the street and looked warm and welcoming.<br> <br>My mother and father and I had seven rooms in the house, my grandmother had the rest, and a door led between my grandmother&#x2019;s kitchen and ours. Every morning, I would wake up and run to have tea and toast with my grandma in her kitchen.<br> <br>She was the boss lady who owned the brewery, handed out paychecks, and gave a big Christmas party every year for her family and employees at Sweeney&#x2019;s Restaurant and Lounge on Route 51 in Belle Vernon. She was a great role model, a tough lady who had to fight to stay on top in a man&#x2019;s world.<br> <br>My world, in contrast, was safe and secure. As an only child, I had my own room, with my own little desk in one corner, a blackboard in another, and all the toys I wanted. I had a tricycle I loved, every paper doll known to man, and countless real dolls.<br> <br>I adored my dolls, one in particular named Carol, who had a huge china head, big blue eyes, and a body bigger than the average baby&#x2019;s. She was so startlingly lifelike that one time I even dressed her in the hat and dress that my mother took me home from the hospital in and painted her nails. Now that same doll belongs to my granddaughter Megan, my youngest son Ryan&#x2019;s child, and she loves Carol as much as I did all those decades ago.<br> <br><br> <br>Smithton was a classic all-American small town, like River City in The Music Man, made up of only four streets, and my childhood there was idyllic. The biggest house in the town belonged to Dr. Post and stood on top of the hill at the end of Fourth Street.<br> <br>All us kids always looked up at Dr. Post&#x2019;s house&#x2014;a country-style home with white shutters, a lot of land, and a big fence around it&#x2014;and dreamed of one day living in such an imposing and impressive mansion ourselves.<br> <br>Meanwhile, as we all waited to grow up, we relished our childhood in Smithton. Our world was small, self-contained, innocent, and ideal. Smithton was so tiny that the town had no policemen, only a sheriff, and there was just one movie theater, the Smithton Movie House, which played movies only on the weekend.<br> <br>Smithton boasted just one grocery store, a drugstore, and a little variety store, which sold toys and clothes and candy. When I was six, overcome by an uncharacteristic surge of greed, I grabbed a stick of bubble gum from the store, slipped it into my pocket, and skipped home with it. When my mother saw me open the bubble-gum packet, she asked where I got the money to buy bubble gum for myself, and I confessed that I had just snatched it from the store. Outraged, she immediately insisted that I return it to the store right away. So I trudged over there, declared to the shocked owner, &#x201c;I took your bubble gum,&#x201d; and threw it right back at him.<br> <br>Afterward, my mother sent me up to my room in disgrace and told me to stay there until she gave me permission to come out. So I stomped upstairs into my bedroom, slammed the door, then tore the linens off the bed, the drapes off the windows, swept everything off the dresser, and dragged it all out into the middle of the room.<br> <br>When my mother eventually came upstairs and yelled through the door that I could come out now, I yelled back defiantly, &#x201c;Why don&#x2019;t you come in and look at my room?&#x201d;<br> <br>She did, drank in all the chaos I had created, and ordered me to put everything back in its place again. Naturally, I couldn&#x2019;t do that on my own, so I got one of my friends to help me instead. I didn&#x2019;t feel guilty about what I had done, either. I was already a little hell-raiser, and proud of it.<br> <br>Another quintessential story from my childhood as Shirley, the precocious little rebel: When I was five years old, my mother took me to the dentist. After examining my teeth, the dentist announced that I had to have a tooth pulled.<br> <br>I shook my head and stamped my feet, but to no avail. An appointment was made for the dreaded extraction of my errant tooth.<br> <br>When the morning of the appointment dawned, my mother and father accompanied me to the dentist, along with my favorite aunt, my mother&#x2019;s sister, Aunt Ina.<br> <br>In the car, I kept yelling that I wasn&#x2019;t going to have my tooth pulled, no way, no how.<br> <br>My mother, to her credit, was kind and patient and kept reassuring me, &#x201c;Now, sweetheart, it&#x2019;s not going to hurt. Your aunt Ina&#x2019;s here, your daddy&#x2019;s here, I&#x2019;m here. Everything is going to be all right.&#x201d;<br> <br>I should have believed her, but being the child that I was, by the time we all climbed to the top of the stairs in the dentist&#x2019;s building and stood outside his office door, I plainly did not. So I pulled away from my family and ran downstairs again.<br> <br>All of them, my mother, my father, and Aunt Ina stood at the top of the stairs, begging me to come back.<br> <br>I just kept shaking my head and stayed put at the bottom of the stairs, and out of reach.<br> <br>Then Aunt Ina hit on a winning formula: &#x201c;Listen, sweetheart, if you come up the stairs again, I&#x2019;ll buy you a pony.&#x201d;<br> <br>Won over by her promise, I looked at my mother first, then at my father, and both of them nodded encouragingly.<br> <br>&#x201c;Come up, sweetheart, I&#x2019;ll hold your hand and nothing&#x2019;s going to hurt you, I promise,&#x201d; Aunt Ina said.<br> <br>Mollified, I ran upstairs, and my mother, my father, and Aunt Ina, all grabbed me and put me in the dentist&#x2019;s chair. Within moments, the dentist had injected me with anesthetic, then yanked out my tooth.<br> <br>&#x201c;But where&#x2019;s my pony? Where&#x2019;s my pony?&#x201d; I cried, when I woke up.<br> <br>I looked questioningly at my mother, my father, and Aunt Ina. None of them met my gaze.<br> <br>The dentist exchanged glances with my father, then shrugged.<br> <br>The writing was on the wall.<br> <br>I stuck my face straight into the dentist&#x2019;s and yelled, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not getting a pony. And you&#x2019;re a big shit!&#x201d;<br> <br>I don&#x2019;t know where or how I learned that particular word, but I was on the right track, really. Because over the next few months, however often I asked my mother, my father, or Aunt Ina where my pony was, however much I begged and cajoled, I always got the same answer: &#x201c;It&#x2019;s coming soon.&#x201d;<br> <br>Not surprisingly, my pony never did materialize, and I was angry with Aunt Ina, with my parents, and with the dentist. They had all lied to me, and I didn&#x2019;t like it at all. Which is probably partly why I became even more of a rebel. The other reason, I guess, was that I was just born that way.<br> <br>I was willful, stubborn, and determined to do exactly what I wanted to do when I wanted to do it. I was unable to follow rules, or to act in the way in which a well-bred young lady was supposed to act. From as far back as I can remember, everyone who knew me agreed that I was already my own person.<br> <br>The dentist incident caused me to loose trust in adults, but I think yet another reason for my tendency to rebel at every turn and to be a tomboy so early on was because I knew that my father had always wanted a son, and because I loved him so much, I wanted to please him.<br> <br>So I yearned to be a boy and to do everything that boys did, only better. I refused to wear dresses and did whatever I could to prove that I was as tough as any boy and could do exactly the same things as boys could, only better.<br> <br>After my father taught me sports and took me to all the Pirates games, I became a great baseball and softball and basketball player and, down the line, became head majorette in high school.<br> <br>My father was delighted by my sporting prowess and made sure that I knew it, praising me at every turn. My mother, however, was not amused that I wasn&#x2019;t evolving into a nice, well-brought-up, little Shirley Temple&#x2013;type young lady...</p><h2>The Providence of Fire: Chronicle of the Unhewn Throne, Book II (Chronicle of the Unhewn Throne, 2)</h2><p><p>Brian Staveley's <i>The Providence of Fire, </i>the second novel in the Chronicle of the Unhewn Throne, a gripping new epic fantasy series.</p><p>The conspiracy to destroy the ruling family of the Annurian Empire is far from over.</p><p>Having learned the identity of her father's assassin, Adare flees the Dawn Palace in search of allies to challenge the coup against her family.

His on-the-ground account follows a single platoon through a 15-month tour of duty in the most dangerous outpost in Afghanistan's Korengal Valley. Through the experiences of these young men at war, he shows what it means to fight, to serve, and to face down mortal danger on a daily basis.</p><p><strong>Evan Thomas and Sebastian Junger: Author One-on-One</strong> <br> In this Amazon exclusive, we brought together authors Sebastian Junger and Evan Thomas and asked them to interview each other. <br> <br> <strong>Evan Thomas</strong> is one of the most respected historians and journalists writing today. He is the author of <em>The War Lovers</em>. <strong>Sebastian Junger</strong> is an internationally acclaimed author and a contributing editor to <i>Vanity Fair</i>, and has been awarded a National Magazine Award and an SAIS Novartis Prize for journalism. He is the author of <em>War</em>. Read on to see Sebastian Junger and Evan Thomas talk about their books.<br> <br> <p></p> <p><b>Evan Thomas</b>: War really is hell in your book. And yet it seems to captivate some of the men who fight it. Why?</p> <p><b>Sebastian Junger</b>: War is hell, as the saying goes--but it isn't only that. It's a lot of other things, too--most of them delivered in forms that are way more pure and intense than what is available back home. The undeniable hellishness of war forces men to bond in ways that aren't necessary--or even possible-- in civilian society. The closest thing to it might be the parent-child bond, but that is not reciprocal. Children are generally not prepared to die for their parents, whereas the men in a platoon of combat infantry for the most part are prepared to do that for each other. For a lot of men, the security of being enclosed by a group like that apparently outweighs the terrors of being in combat. During World War II, wounded soldiers kept going AWOL from the rear-base hospitals in order to rejoin their units on the front line. Clearly, for those men, rejoining their comrades was more important than the risk of death.</p> <p>I'm curious about the reactions of foot soldiers in previous wars--the Civil War, the Spanish-American War. Are there letters from soldiers describing their anguish at being separated from their comrades? Or is this a modern phenomenon? </p> <p><b>Thomas</b>: In the Spanish-American War, Teddy Roosevelt made a cult out of his band of brothers, the Rough Riders, with the twist that he was bringing together gentlemen and cowboys to be true Americans. It was a romantic ideal but largely realized in the short (several week) war they fought--two battles, about a 15 percent casualty rate. The anguish you speak of was felt by the Rough Riders who were left behind--there was no room on the transports for roughly a third of Roosevelt's troopers, and they had to stay behind in Florida. Roosevelt wrote of them weeping over being separated from their comrades and missing out on the fight.</p> <p>Roosevelt's war lust was sated by the Spanish-American War--for a time. He was not a notably bellicose president ("Talk softly but carry a big stick"). But when World War I came, he was almost pathologically driven to get back into the fight. He badgered President Wilson to let him raise a division. (Wilson, not wanting to create a martyr, said no.) Do you think the brotherhood of combat is in some ways addictive? What is it like for the soldiers and marines coming home?</p> <p><b>Junger</b>: It's amazing to see these same themes played out war after war. Politicians seize war for themselves, in some ways, and the public certainly holds them accountable for it--but the men who actually do the fighting are extraordinarily conflicted about it all. Only one man in the platoon I was with chose to leave the army after the deployment--Brendan O'Byrne, a main character in my book and now someone I consider a good friend. A few weeks ago we were hanging out with a family I know, and the talk turned to how rough the fighting was in Afghanistan. The mother, a woman in her thirties, asked Brendan if there was anything he missed about the experience. Brendan looked at her and said, without any irony, "Yes, almost all of it." I think what Brendan meant was that he missed an existence where every detail mattered--whether you tied your shoelaces, whether you cleaned your rifle--and you never had to question the allegiance of your friends. As Brendan said at another point, "There are guys in the platoon who straight-up hate each other-- but they'd all die for each other." Once they've been exposed to that, it's very hard for these guys to go back to a seemingly meaningless and ill-defined civilian life.</p> <p> What happened to the men after they returned from their adventures with Roosevelt? Where did their lives lead them?</p> <p><b>Thomas</b>: The Rough Riders seem to have had endless reunions--but nothing like the PTSD so widely reported today. But perhaps that was because they were only fighting for about a month--a "splendid little war," as diplomat John Hay called it, apparently without irony. In <i>The War Lovers</i>, I was looking at another kind of camaraderie--the bond of men who want to get the country into war, who think that war will somehow restore the nation to spiritual greatness. Roosevelt and his best friend, Senator Henry Cabot Lodge, believed that America at the end of the 19th century had become "overcivilized"--that young men were turning soft and needed to somehow stir "the wolf rising in the heart," as Roosevelt put it. "All the great races have been fighting races," he said. It is significant that Roosevelt and Lodge, who pushed America to go to war with Spain in 1898, had written about war a great deal but never seen it. President William McKinley resisted; he had, as he noted, seen "the dead piled up at Antietam" in the Civil War. But the hawks in America were able to roll the doves, not for the last time.</p> <p>Before <i>The War Lovers</i> I wrote <i>Sea of Thunder</i>, a book about the last naval battle of World War II, Leyte Gulf. I interviewed a number of survivors from the USS Johnston, a destroyer sunk in the battle after an unbelievably brave fight against superior forces. About 220 men went in the water but only about half of them were rescued. Because of a series of mistakes by the navy, they were left in the water for two and half days. The sharks came on the first night. For a long time, the survivors did not talk much about it. But then, after Tom Brokaw wrote <i>The Greatest Generation</i>, they began having reunions and speaking--almost compulsively--bout their experiences. The recollections are often harrowing. Yet even years later, when the veterans compiled their recollections in a book of about eighty oral histories, the veterans did not speak of their own fear, with only one exception, as I recall. Somehow acknowledging fear remained a taboo.</p> <p></p> <p>In <i>War</i> you write about fear in clinical and fascinating ways. Did you have a hard time getting men to talk about fear? </p> <p><b>Junger</b>: Getting the men to talk about fear was very hard because, well, I think they were afraid of it. Their biggest worry seemed to be failing the other men of the platoon in some way, and whenever someone got killed, a common reaction was to search their own actions for blame. They didn't want to believe that a good man could get killed for no reason; someone had to be at fault. During combat, their personal fear effectively got subsumed by the greater anxiety that they would fail to do their job and someone else would get killed. The shame of that would last a lifetime, and they would literally do suicidal things to help platoon mates who were in danger. The classic story of a man throwing himself on a hand grenade--certain death, but an action that will almost certainly save everyone else--is neither a Hollywood clichï¿½ nor something that only happened in wars gone by. It is something that happens with regularity, and I don't think it can be explained by "army training" or any kind of suicidal impulse. I think that kind of courage goes to the heart of what it means to be human and to affiliate with others in a kind of transcendent way. Of course, once you have experienced a bond like that, everything else looks pathetic and uninteresting. That may be one reason combat vets have such a hard time returning to society..</p> <p>My guess is that the survivors of the USS Johnston were more traumatized by the deaths of their comrades than the prospect of their own death. Did any of them speak to that? What were their nightmares about? Has anyone studied the effect of that trauma on their lives--divorce rate, suicide rate, that kind of thing?</p> <p><b>Thomas</b>: They certainly described the deaths of their colleagues--who went mad from drinking seawater, or were killed by sharks, or died from untreated wounds or exposure (the seawater was about 86 degrees at night, cold if you spent all night immersed in it). Some just swam away and drowned. In one or two cases, men begged to be put out of their misery and were. There were complicated emotions over the deaths. There wasn't enough room on the rafts for all the men, so when one died, it made room for another. I am sure there was terrible guilt, but I didn't get into it with the survivors I interviewed. I don't think they were studied as a cohort. I think they were expected to go on with their lives, and I think by and large they did.</p> <p>Nations are changed by war--but somehow, only for a time. We have a way of forgetting the horrors of war, in the need young men (and old men who missed war) have to some experience the greatest challenge to their manhood. This was true in the period I wrote about in <i>The War Lovers</i>, more than three decades after the Civil War: men like Roosevelt and Lodge wanted to somehow experience the glories of war, and not think too hard about the way wars often turn out in unexpected ways. I know in Cuba, where I visited to research <i>The War Lovers</i>, the Cubans don't think of the Americans as their liberators from Spanish rule, but rather as foreign invaders. That's unfair, and in many ways just plain wrong, but not so hard to understand if you put yourself in the shoes of a country occupied by a foreign army. Some things never change.</p> <br><br>Sebastian Junger is the <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of <em>The Perfect Storm</em> and <i>A Death in Belmont</i>.

She must remember her mission and never waste the little deeds that fill her day the precious bits of wool she's been given to weave the majestic tapestry of married love." </p><p> This remarkable book will show you how to start weaving love into the tapestry of your marriage today, as it leads you more deeply into the joys of love.</p>Alice von Hildebrand received a master's degree and doctorate in philosophy from Fordham University in New York.

Shuck the oysters, pouring the liquor into a cup and keeping the oysters on their bottom shells. Set the oysters and liquor aside. A good trick for cooking the oysters is to fill a big cast-iron frying pan about half full with coarse salt, put it in the oven, and preheat the oven to 450ï¿½F (230ï¿½C), then heat the pan for an extra 15 minutes. This will help to accelerate the cooking process. <p></p> 2. Place the potatoes and salted water to cover in a small pot over medium-high heat. Boil for 2 to 3 minutes, or until slightly softened. Drain the potatoes, let cool, and pat dry. Meanwhile, in another frying pan, crisp the bacon over medium-high heat until light brown. Add the potatoes to the pan and cook, stirring occasionally, for about 4 minutes, or until tender. Add the garlic and cook for another minute. Remove from the heat. <p></p> 3. In a bowl, rapidly whisk together the egg yolks, the cream, and whatever oyster liquor you were able to gather. Add the chives, Cheddar, a pinch each of salt and pepper, and the bacon-potato mixture and whisk to mix. Divide evenly among the oysters, spooning it on top. Dust the tops with the bread crumbs, then finish with a piece of butter. <p></p> 4. Pull the cast-iron pan out of the oven and carefully nest the oysters in the hot salt. Return the pan to the oven and cook for 4 to 7 minutes, or until the tops start to turn golden. Serve immediately. <p></p><b>Frï¿½dï¿½ric Morin</b> (right) is the co-owner/chef of Joe Beef, Liverpool House, and McKiernan Luncheonette.

And surprisingly, the protocol employs common and natural supplements, and avoids the countless homeopathic remedies and antibiotics frequently prescribed to children that are often both toxic and expensive.Within a few days of starting the protocol many children will experience a connectedness to their surrounds never previously experienced. Significant improvements in motor, sensory and speech delays are realized within the first few weeks.Attention and learning disabilities rapidly begin to resolve within the first few weeks to months as the child's brain restores neuronal pathways damaged by the physical, emotional and inflammatory traumas commonly experienced in childhood.Through a simple 2-step process of re-balancing intestinal bacteria and omega fatty acids, Dr. Nemechek has discovered how to re-activate the brain&#x2019;s neuronal pruning and repair processes thereby allowing a child's brain to begin repairing past injuries and developing correctly.Re-balancing intestinal bacteria also eliminates the excessive production of propionic acid that is responsible for the disconnected and often strange behaviors that are highly characteristic of autism.With the help of Jean Nemechek's writing and editing style, the complexities of omega fatty acids restoration, intestinal bacteriology, autonomic restoration and cumulative brain injury are translated into processes that are easily understandable to the non-scientist.This book is a complete how-to guide outlining the specific supplements and dosages employed by Dr. Nemechek in the treatment of his patients. Readers will learn Dr. Nemechek's step-by-step method of reversing autism and other developmental disorders. Included are specific chapters dealing with relapses, addressing the use of antibiotics, strategies for prevention as well as future vaccinations.The rapid rate of improvement seen with The Nemechek Protocol has caused it to become one of the fastest growing treatment options for children around the world. Thousands of families around the world are benefitting from this safe, inexpensive and highly effective treatment for the devastating problems commonly affecting children today. The phrase &#x201c;Miracles do Happen&#x201d; has never been as true when witnessing children regain speech within a few weeks to months after utilizing The Nemechek Protocol.</p><p>After his training in Internal Medicine at UCLA, Dr. Nemechek spent 25 years honing his clinical and research skills caring for individuals infected with the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV). Dr. Nemechek along with other HIV specialists of his generation were responsible for the rapid pace of discoveries that transformed HIV infection from a universally fatal infection into a chronically manageable condition. After relocating with his wife Jean to Arizona in 2010, Dr. Nemechek began focusing his considerable experience in nutrition, metabolism, inflammatory disorders and the autonomic nervous system on techniques designed to do the impossible, reverse chronic brain injury. Within a few years Dr. Nemechek was routinely reversing lifelong brain injuries and symptoms in athletes, soldiers and those with other forms of physical, emotional and inflammatory brain injuries. As word spread of his breakthrough in the brain recovery, patients began traveling to his Arizona clinic from all corners of the globe. During the discovery of this revolutionary brain repair technique, Dr. Nemechek developed a similar technique for children that was capable of reversing autism, most developmental issues and other common maladies such as ADD, hyperactivity, depression and anxiety. Jean Nemechek received her law degree from Washburn University and practiced as a child-abuse and city prosecutor during most of her law career. After moving to Arizona, Jean focused her management and writing skills on helping support and develop Dr. Nemechek's work in brain recovery. Jean&#x2019;s substantial communication skills have helped translate the complexities of The Nemechek Protocol into a positive, life-altering program that allows children to return to a more functional, capable lifestyle.</p><h2>God Meant it for Good</h2><p>British pastor R.T.

What is it for? To answer these questions, Stratford Caldecott shines a fresh light on the three arts of language, in a marvelous recasting of the Trivium whereby Grammar, Dialectic, and Rhetoric are explored as Remembering, Thinking, and Communicating. These are the foundational steps every student must take towards conversion of heart and mind, so that a Catholic Faith can be lived out in unabashed pursuit of the True, the Good, and the Beautiful. <i>Beauty in the Word</i> is a unique contribution to bringing these bountiful aspects of the Real back to the center of learning, where they rightfully belong. If your concern is for the true meaning of education for your children, here is the place to begin.</p><p><b>Stratford Caldecott</b> is an editor of the English edition of <i>Magnificat</i>, and editor of <i>Second Spring</i> and <i>Humanum</i>. His books include <i>The Seven Sacraments: Entering the Mysteries of God</i> (Crossroad, 2006), <i>Beauty for Truth's Sake: On the Re-enchantment of Education </i>(Brazos, 2009), and <i>All Things Made New: The Mysteries of the World in Christ</i> (Angelico, 2011). He lives in Oxford."<i>Beauty in the Word</i> is the fruit of a lifetime's thinking about the relation between faith and life. Those responsible for new initiatives in Catholic education have a chance to recreate its inner spirit and not just its outer frame. They will not easily find a programme more inspirational than the one presented here."--<b>Aidan Nichols, OP</b><br><br>"Stratford Caldecott's words about beauty are themselves beautiful, and also wise; learned and also arresting. He offers a rare combination of intelligence and profound vision, yet combines this with accessibility and luminous transparency."--<b>Catherine Pickstock</b>, University of Cambridge<br><br>"C.S. Lewis envisioned modern education as the irrigation of deserts. Caldecott here brings nourishing water to the cry of the modern imagination: 'I thirst'. Drink deeply, from a book brim-full with the living water capable of transforming our educational practices."--<b>Cyrus P. Olsen III</b>, University of Scranton<br><br>"In this insightful book, Stratford Caldecott has presented a way to understand education that includes philosophy, theology, the arts, literature, the studies of beauty and truth and what is good. It is a rare book that understands the unity of knowledge; this is one of those rare books."--<b>James V.

Not true. The intention of this short guide is practical and straightforward: to say what yoga really is and to apply its principles to everyday life. It leads us through the eight-limbed system, a coherent framework that has been handed down and elaborated upon for thousands of years and consists of five "outer limbs," which pertain to our experience of the social world and the operation of our senses, and three "inner limbs," which focus on the mind. Stuart Ray Sarbacker and Kevin Kimple present the eight-limbed system as something that can be turned to again and again to deepen and expand understanding and practice. As an introduction and overview to the essence of yoga, <i>The Eight Limbs of Yoga </i>is unparalleled for clarity, usefulness, and concision.</p></p><p>The intention of this short book is to show the reader how to apply the principles of yoga in everyday life, in both formal and informal ways. Its focus is on pragmatic tools that facilitate a new perspective on the world.

With topics ranging from the dynamic interplay between practice and dispassion to how to cultivate our commitment, Stuart Ray Sarbacker and Kevin Kimple's <i>The Eight Limbs of Yoga</i> provides a clear explanation of yoga's transformative power and the guidance and tools to set ourselves on the path towards yoga's infinite potential.<b>Stuart Ray Sarbacker</b> is an associate professor of Comparative Religion and Indian Philosophy at Oregon State University and specializes in South Asian religion and philosophy. <b>Kevin Kimple</b> is the Director of Ashtanga Yoga Eugene and is an authorized Level Two Ashtanga instructor.</p><h2>Preserving Our Italian Heritage Cookbook</h2><p>Book by Sons of Italy Florida Foundation, Florida Foundation</p><p></p><h2>Where the River Ends: A Novel</h2><p><b><i>A powerfully emotional and beautifully written story of heartbreaking loss and undying love</i></b> <br><br>He was a fishing guide and struggling artist from a south George trailer park.

He and his family live in Jacksonville, Florida.<b>1<br>MAY 30<br></b><br>I climbed the final step into my studio, sniffed the dank fireplace and wondered how long it would take an errant flame to consume everything in here. Minutes I should think. Arms folded, I leaned against the wall and stared at all the eyes staring back at me. Abbie had tried so hard to make me believe. Even taken me halfway around the world. Introduced me to Rembrandt, poked me in the shoulder and said, "You can do that." So I had painted. Faces mostly. My mother had planted the seed that, years later, Abbie watered, nurtured and pruned. In truth, given a good flame and a tardy fire department, I stood to make more money on an insurance payout. Stacked around me in layered rows against the four walls lay more than three hundred dusty works--a decade's worth--all oil on canvas. Faces captured in moments speaking emotions known by hearts but spoken by few mouths. At one time, it had come so easily. So fluidly. I remember moments when I couldn't wait to get in here, when I couldn't hold it back, when I would paint on four canvases at once. Those all-nighters when I discovered Vesuvius in me.<br><br>The last decade of my life was staring back at me. Once hung with promise in studios across Charleston, paintings had slowly, one at a time, returned. Self-proclaimed art critics pontificating in local papers complained that my work "lacked originality," "was absent of heart" and my favorite, "was boring and devoid of artistic skill or understanding."<br><br>There's a reason the critics are called critics.<br><br>On the easel before me stretched a white canvas. Dusty, sun-faded and cracked. It was empty.<br><br>Like me.<br><br>I stepped through the window, along the side of the roof, and climbed the iron stairs to the crow's nest. I smelled the salt and looked out over the water. Somewhere a seagull squawked at me. The air was thick, dense and blanketed the city in quiet. The sky was clear, but it smelled like rain. The moon hung high and full, casting shadows on the water that lapped the concrete bulkhead a hundred feet away. The lights of Fort Sumpter sat glistening in the distance to the southeast. Before me, the Ashley and Cooper rivers ran into one. Most Charlestonians will tell you it is there that the two form the Atlantic Ocean. Sullivan's Island sat just north, along with the beach where we used to swim. I closed my eyes and listened for the echo of our laughter.<br><br>That'd been a while.<br><br>The "Holy City," with its competing steeples piercing the night sky, lay still behind me. Below me stretched my shadow. Cast upon the roof, it tugged at my pants leg, begging me backward and pulling me down. The ironwork that held me had been fashioned some fifty years ago by local legend Philip Simmons. Now in his nineties, his work had become the Charleston rave and was very much in demand. The crow's nest, having ridden out the storm, had come with the house. In the thirteen years we'd lived here, this nine square feet of perch had become the midnight platform from which I viewed the world. My singular and solitary escape.<br><br>My cell phone vibrated in my pocket. I checked the screen and saw the Texas area code. "Hello?"<br><br>"Doss Michaels?"<br><br>"Speaking."<br><br>"This is Anita Becker, assistant to Dr. Paul Virth."<br><br>"Yes?" My breathing was short. So much hung on her next few words.<br><br>She paused. "We wanted to call and . . ."--I knew it before she said it--". . . say that the oversight committee has met and decided on the parameters of the study. At this time, we're only accepting primary cases. Not secondary." The wind shifted and swiveled the squeaking vane. The rooster now pointed south. "Next year, if this study proceeds as we hope, we're planning on adding a study on secondary . . ." Either she faded off, or maybe I did. "We're sending a letter recommending Abbie for a study with Doctors Plist and Mackles out of Sloan-Kettering . . ."<br><br>"Thank you . . . very much." I closed the phone.<br><br>The problem with a Hail Mary pass is that it hangs in the air so long, and most are dropped in the end zone. That's why they invoke God.<br><br>Because it's impossible to begin with.<br><br>The phone rang a second time, but I let it ring. A minute passed and it rang again. I checked the faceplate. It read, "Dr. Ruddy."<br><br>"Hey, Ruddy."<br><br>"Doss." His voice was quiet. Subdued. I could see him, leaning over his desk, head resting in his hands. His chair squeaked. "The scan results are in. If you two could get around the speakerphone, thought maybe we'd talk through them."<br><br>His tone of voice told me enough. "Ruddy, she's sleeping. Finally. Did that most of yesterday. Maybe you could just give them to me." He read between the lines.<br><br>"I'm with you." A pause. "Umm . . . they're uhh . . ." He choked. Ruddy had been our lead doctor since the beginning. "Doss, I'm sorry."<br><br>We listened to each other listening to each other. "How long?"<br><br>"A week. Maybe two. Longer if you can keep her horizontal . . . and still."<br><br>I forced a laugh. "You know better than that."<br><br>A deep breath. "Yep."<br><br>I slid the phone back in my pocket and scratched my two-day stubble. My eyes stared out over the water, but my mind was a couple hundred miles away.<br><br>Empty-handed and lungs half full, I climbed down and back through the window. Running my fingers along the trim tacked to the wall, I crept down another flight. The staircase was narrow, made of twelve-inch-wide pine planks, which at nearly two hundred years old, creaked loudly--tapping out a story of age and the drunken pirates who once stumbled down them.<br><br>The sound lifted her eyelids, but I doubted she'd been asleep. Fighters don't sleep between rounds. A cross breeze slipped through the open windows and filtered across our room, raising goose bumps across her calves.<br><br>Footsteps sounded downstairs, so I crossed the room, closed the bedroom door and returned. I sat next to her, slid the fleece blanket over her legs and leaned back against the headboard. She whispered, "How long have I been asleep?"<br><br>I shrugged.<br><br>"Yesterday?"<br><br>"Almost." While we could manage the pain with medication, we couldn't deter its debilitating effects. She would lie still, motionless for hours, fighting an inner battle in which I played helpless spectator. Then for reasons neither of us could explain, she'd experience moments--sometimes even days--of total lucidity, when the pain would relent and she was as normal as ever. Then with little warning, it would return and she'd begin her own private battle once again. It is there that you learn the difference between tired and fatigued. Sleep cures tired, but it has no effect on fatigued.<br>She smelled the air, catching the last remnants of aftershave that still hung in the air. I lifted the window. She raised an eyebrow. "He was here?"<br><br>I stared out over the water. "Yup."<br><br>"How'd that go?"<br><br>"About like normal."<br><br>"That good, huh? What is it this time?"<br><br>"He's"--I lifted both hands in the air making quotation marks with my fingers--" 'moving you.' "<br><br>She sat up. "Where?"<br><br>More quotation marks. " 'Home.' "<br><br>She shook her head and let out a deep breath that puffed up her cheeks like a blowfish. "For him, it's my mother all over again."<br><br>I shrugged.<br><br>"How'd you leave it?"<br><br>"I didn't. He did."<br><br>"And?"<br><br>"He's sending over a team of people in the morning to . . . 'collect you.' "<br><br>"He sounds like he's taking out the trash." She pointed at the phone. "Give it to me. I don't care if he is four heartbeats from the President."<br><br>"Honey, I'm not letting him take you anywhere." I flicked a piece of paint off the windowsill.<br><br>She listened to the sound of footsteps downstairs. "Shift change?"<br><br>I nodded, watching a barge slowly putter up the Ashley.<br><br>"Don't tell me he talked to them, too."<br><br>"Oh, yeah. Really put everybody at ease. Basically read them the riot act disguised as an 'attaboy.' I just love the way he gives you what he wants you to have under the pretense of your best interest." I shook my head. "Sleight-of-hand manipulation."<br><br>She wrapped her leg around mine, using it as leverage to push her head up, allowing her eyes to meet mine. The once fit thighs now gave way to bony knees, thin veins and sticklike shins. Her left hipbone, the once voluptuous peak of the hourglass, pointed up through her gown, which hung loosely over the skin. After four years, her skin was nearly translucent--a faded sun-drenched canvas. Now it hung across her collarbone like a clothesline.<br><br>The shuffling downstairs faded into the kitchen. She stared at the floor. "They're good people. They do this every day. We've only got to do it once."<br><br>"Yeah . . . and once is enough."<br><br>Our bed was one of those old, four-poster, Southern things that Southern women go gaga over. Dark mahogany, it stood about four feet off the ground, was bookended by steps on either side and Lord help you if you rolled off it at night. There were two advantages: Abbie slept there, and when I laid on my side, my line of sight was above the windowsill, giving me a view of Charleston Harbor.<br>She stared out the window where all the world rolled out as a map, the green and red channel lights blinking back. Red right return. She slid her fingers into mine. "How's she look up there?"<br><br>I loosened the scarf and let it fall down across her shoulders. "Beautiful."<br><br>She rolled toward me, placed her head on my chest and ran her fingers inside my button-down where both my chest hairs grew. She shook her head. "You need to get your head examined."<br><br>"Funny. Your father just told me the same thing." I stared back out across the water, blindly running my finger along the outline of her ear and neck. A shrimp boat was working her way out to sea. "Actually, he's been telling you that for almost fourteen years."<br><br>"You'd think by now, I'd listen." The boom lights of the shrimp boat rolled slowly east to west, seeming to skim the ocean's surface as she reached the larger swells.<br><br>Her eyes lay sunken, the lids dark and dim, as if eye shadow had been tatooed in. "Promise me one thing," she said.<br><br>"I already did that."<br><br>"I'm being serious."<br><br>"Okay, but not if it involves your dad." She pressed thumb to index finger, snatched down and plucked out one of my chest hairs. "Hey"--I rubbed my chest--"it's not like I've got a surplus of those things."<br><br>Her fingers, like her legs, were long. Now that they were skinnier, they seemed even longer. She pointed in my face. "You finished?" She fingered a circle around the opening in my shirt. " 'Cause I see one more."<br><br>That's my Abbie. Thirty pounds lighter and still making jokes. And that right there is what I held to. That thing. That finger in the face--the one that threatened strength, promised humor and said "I love you more than me."<br><br>She scratched my chest and nodded at the picture of her father. "You think you two will ever talk?" I studied the picture. We had taken it last Easter as he christened his new darling, Reel Estate. He stood, broken bottle held by the neck, champagne dripping off the bow, white hair ruffled by the sea breeze. Under other circumstances, I would have liked him, and sometimes I think he would have liked me.<br><br>I glanced at his picture on her dresser. "Oh, I'm sure he'll talk."<br><br>"You two are more alike than you think."<br><br>"Please . . ."<br><br>"I'm serious."<br><br>She was right. "He still rubs me the wrong way."<br><br>"Well, me too, but he's still Daddy."<br><br>We laid in the darkness listening to the footsteps of well-intentioned and unwelcome strangers shuffling below us. "You'd think," I said, staring at the sound coming up through the floor, "they'd come up with a better name than 'hospice.' "<br><br>She rolled her eyes. "How's that?"<br><br>"It just sounds so . . ." I trailed off.<br><br>We sat awhile longer. "Did Ruddy call?"<br><br>I nodded.<br><br>"All three?"<br><br>I nodded again.<br><br>"No better?"<br><br>I shook my head.<br><br>"What about the guy at Harvard?"<br><br>"We talked yesterday. They're still a few months out from starting that trial."<br><br>"Sloan-Kettering?"<br><br>I shook my head.<br><br>"What about the website?" Two years ago, we'd created a website for people with Abbie's condition. It had become a clearinghouse of information. We gleaned a lot from it. Got to know a lot of people who led us to a lot of really knowledgeable people. A great resource.<br><br>"No."<br><br>"Well, that just sucks."<br><br>"You took the words right out of my mouth."<br><br>Silence again, while she studied a fingernail absent of polish. Finally she looked at me. "Oregon?"<br><br>The Oregon Health &amp; Science University, or OHSU, was on the cutting edge of developing some new systemic therapy that targeted cancer at the cellular level. Real front-lines stuff. We'd been in contact with them for several months, hoping for some sort of clinical trial in which we could participate. Yesterday, they had established the parameters for the trial. Because her disease had moved out of her organ of origination, Abbie didn't qualify. I shook my head.<br><br>"Can they make an exception?"<br><br>I shook my head a second time.<br><br>"Did you ask?"<br><br>It had taken so much. And yet, all I could do was sit back and watch. While I held her hand, fed her soup, bathed her or combed her hair, it had no quit. No matter what you threw at it.<br><br>I wanted to take it back. Wanted to kill it. Slice it into a thousand painful pieces, then stamp it into the earth, grind it into nothing and eradicate its scent from the planet. But it didn't get here because it was stupid. It never shows its face and it's hard to kill something you can't see.<br><br>"Yes."<br><br>"And M. D. Anderson in Houston?" I didn't answer. She asked again.<br><br>I managed a whisper. "They called and . . . they're still two, maybe three, weeks from a decision. The uhh"--I snapped my fingers--"oversight committee couldn't meet for some reason. Some of the doctors were on vacation . . ." Looking away, I shook my head.<br><br>She rolled her eyes. "Another holding pattern."<br><br>I nodded. A single piece of yellow legal paper lay folded in thirds on the bedside table. Abbie's handwriting shone through, covering the entire page. Beneath it sat a blank envelope. A silver Parker ballpoint pen rested at ten o'clock and served as a paperweight.</p><h2>Grieving God&#39;s Way: The Path to Lasting Hope and Healing</h2><p><p>The loss of a loved one is devastating, and the grief that follows is often crippling. While modern Western culture has adopted an aren't-you-over-it-yet? attitude toward death and the grief it brings, the grieving process can take years.</p><p>Weeks and months go by with no visible improvement. We might even wonder if God has forsaken us. Then one day it happens: We laugh. We feel connnected, restless, maybe even hopeful. We're no longer consumed by our loss, and our thoughts turn outward. These are the first signs of healing.</p><p>Though the tendency in our fast-paced society is to suppress our grief or ignore it all together, <i>Grieving God's Way</i> inspires a different course of action. In this 90-day devotional Margaret Brownley provides the framework for a methodical grieving process that follows God's plan.</p><p>Grieving God's way requires us to trust that He will lead us through the darkness, heal our pain, take away our weariness, and fill our hearts with hope, peace, and new purpose. From defining what grief is to validating its importance, Brownley gives us the components necessary to find God within our sorrow and grieve with Him.</p><p>Divided into four sections, <i>Grieving God's Way</i> offers insight into healing our grieving body, soul, heart, and spirit. Infused with scriptures and inspirational haiku by Diantha Ain, this book motivates us to shift our grieving from man's way to God's way. . . slow and often invisible but with truly amazing results.</p><p>So how long does it take to grieve? As long as it takes God to heal.</p></p><p>Anyone purchasing this book can order a FREE workbook by contacting me at margaretbrownley1@gmail.com<br><br>Also, I'm offering a six-week curriculum based on the book&nbsp;FREE&nbsp;to churches and other groups.Margaret Brownley never dreamed that one day she would write a book on grief.

The government's success at relieving unemployment and its social programs to eliminate class barriers unlock the secret to Hitler's undeniable popularity which, in light of war crimes, seems so incomprehensible today.</p><p>Documents from German, Soviet and British archives help illuminate the diplomatic atmosphere of the times and the challenge Hitler confronted when weighing foreign policy decisions. Evidence shows that these were often spontaneous reaction to fluctuating political constellations rather than planned long in advance. During the war, oppressive German measures in occupied countries invited criticism from <em>within </em>Germany as the National Socialist dogma, particularly the race theory, began losing influence in official circles and the military.</p><p>An in-depth analysis of Hitler's wartime campaigns, especially Stalingrad and Normandy, reveals that the German resistance not only plotted to topple the regime, but systematically sabotaged combat operations causing the German army catastrophic defeats. The motive, historical records demonstrate, was not so idealistic as popularly believed. The author researched primarily German records, to present readers in the United States and Great Britain with information never before translated into English and otherwise inaccessible to them. Expanded edition with over 100 illustrations and 328 pages.</p></p><p></p><h2>The Beekeeper&#39;s Ball (The Bella Vista Chronicles, 2)</h2><p>#1 New York Times bestselling author Susan Wiggs returns to sun-drenched Bella Vista, where the land's bounty yields a rich harvest...and family secrets that have long been buried&nbsp;<br><br>Isabel Johansen, a celebrated chef who grew up in the enchanting Sonoma town of Archangel, is transforming her childhood home into a destination cooking school&#x2014;a unique place for other dreamers to come and learn the culinary arts. Bella Vista's rambling mission-style hacienda, with its working apple orchards, bountiful gardens and beehives, is the idyllic venue for Isabel's project...and the perfect place for her to forget the past.&nbsp;<br><br>But Isabel's carefully ordered plans begin to go awry when swaggering, war-torn journalist Cormac O'Neill arrives to dig up old history. He's always been better at exposing the lives of others than showing his own closely guarded heart, but the pleasures of small-town life and the searing sensuality of Isabel's kitchen coax him into revealing a few truths of his own.</p><p>Susan Wiggs is the author of many beloved bestsellers, including the popular Lakeshore Chronicles series. She has won many awards for her work, including a RITA from Romance Writers of America. Visit her website at www.SusanWiggs.com.The first rule of beekeeping, and the one Isabel swore she would never break, was to remain calm. As she regarded the massive swarm of honeybees clinging to a Ligustrum branch, she suspected she was about to go back on her word.<br><br>She was new to beekeeping, but that was no excuse. She thought she was ready to capture a swarm. She'd read all the beekeeping books in the Archangel town library. She'd watched a dozen online videos. But none of the books and videos had mentioned that the humming of ten thousand bees was pretty much the creepiest sound she'd ever heard. It reminded her of the flying monkey music in <em>The Wizard of Oz.</em><br><br>"Don't think about flying monkeys," she muttered under her breath. And that, of course, caused her to focus even more on the sound.<br><br>It took every fiber of power and control in her body to keep from fleeing to the nearest irrigation ditch, screaming at the top of her lungs.<br><br>The morning had started out with such promise. She'd leaped out of bed at daybreak to greet yet another perfect Sonoma day. A few subtle threads of coastal mist slipped through the inland valleys and highlands, softening the green and gold hills like a bridal veil. Isabel had hurriedly donned shorts and a t-shirt, then taken Charlie for his morning walk past the apple and walnut trees, inhaling the air scented with lavender and sun-warmed grass. Paradise on earth.<br><br>Lately, she'd been waking up early every day, too excited to sleep. She was working on the biggest project she'd ever dared to undertake&#x2014;transforming her family home into a destination cooking school. The work was nearing completion, and if everything went according to schedule, she would welcome the first guests of the Bella Vista Cooking School at harvest time.<br><br>The big, rambling mission-style hacienda, with its working apple orchard and gardens, was the perfect venue for the project. The place had long been too much for just her and her grandfather, and her dreams had always been too big for her budget. She was passionate about cooking and in love with the idea of creating a beautiful place for other dreamers to come and learn the culinary arts. At long last, she'd found a way to grow into the house that was too large.<br><br>Her head full of plans for the day, she'd gone to check the bees with Charlie, the rangy German shepherd mutt. When she'd reached the hives, located on a slope by a rutted track at the end of the main orchard, she'd heard the flying monkeys and realized what was happening&#x2014;a swarm.<br><br>It was a natural occurrence. Like a dowager making way for her successor, the old queen left the hive in search of new digs, taking along more than half the workers. From her reading, Isabel knew it was rare for a swarm to occur so early in the day, but the morning sun was already intense. Scout bees were out searching for the ideal spot for a new hive while the rest of them clung en masse to the branch and waited. As the beekeeper, Isabel would need to capture the swarm and get them into an empty hive before the scouts returned and led the whole mass of them away, to parts unknown.<br><br>She had quickly sent a text message to Jamie Westfall, a local bee expert. Only last week, he had left a flyer in her mailbox&#x2014;<em>Will trade beekeeping services for honey harvest.</em> She'd never met him, but kept his number in her phone contacts, just in case. Unfortunately, a swarm in this intermediate stage was ephemeral, and if the guy didn't get here quickly, Isabel would be on her own. She'd thrown on her jumpsuit, hat and veil, grabbed a pair of loppers and a cardboard box with a lid, and approached the hanging swarm.<br><br>This should be simple, she thought. Except that the thing hanging on the bush looked like a horrible, reddish, living beard.<br><br>"Okay then," she murmured, her gaze never leaving the dense cluster of honeybees, her heart pounding. Capturing a swarm was supposed to be exciting work. It was the ideal way to fill more hives, and it prevented the bees from nesting in places where they'd be a nuisance, like in Grandfather's prize apple trees.<br><br>Charlie reclined laconically in the high grass at the side of the hill, sunning himself.<br><br>"I've got this," she said. "It's the perfect swarm. Ha ha, get it, Charlie?" She looked over at the skinny dog. "The perfect swarm. I crack myself up."<br><br>Isabel didn't feel strange, talking to a dog. She'd always done it, an only child growing up at Bella Vista, secluded by the surrounding orchards and vineyards and overprotected by doting grandparents. As a child, she had learned to be happy in her own company. As an adult, she guarded herself, because that was what life had taught her.<br><br>She felt herself drowning in the humming sound. It filled her head and then flowed through her like the blood in her veins. She kept reminding herself that there was nothing to fear despite the fearsome appearance and furious sound of the swarm. They were looking for a home, that was all. Anyone in the world could understand that need. And if there was anything Isabel craved, it was to feel at home in the world.<br><br>While she stood there, protected from head to toe by her jumpsuit, hat and veil, the scouts were out seeking a place to create a new hive. If they found a spot and returned to the branch before Isabel bagged the swarm, it would all be over.<br><br>"Here goes, Charlie," she said. "I'm going in. No loud noises, no sudden movements."<br><br>She picked up the cardboard box and set it on the ground under the branch, which was sagging now under the weight of the bees. Yikes, that was a big swarm. The sun beat down on her back, reminding her that time was running out.<br><br>Her hands trembled as she picked up the loppers. "Now," she said, steeling herself. "I'd better not wait any longer." She was tired of missed chances. It was time to seize the moment. Heart thumping, she opened the jaws of the loppers and chopped off the branch just above the swarm. The swarm landed in the waiting box&#x2014;most of it, anyway.<br><br>It took all her control not to flee. The humming intensified, and individual bees broke away from the cluster. She was just inches from breaking the unbreakable rule by freaking out. So what if the swarm disappeared? It was hardly a matter of life or death.<br><br>But it was a matter of pride and will. She wanted to keep bees. Bella Vista had always been a working farm, its orchards and gardens sustaining the Johansen family since the end of World War II. Now Isabel wanted to expand the produce. She wanted her own honey.<br><br>The bees were docile at this stage of swarming. They weren't defensive because they were engorged with honey and had no home to defend.<br><br>"All right, guys," she said through gritted teeth. "Here we go." She bent down and gently adjusted the branch so it would fit in the box. The bees that dropped free of the box crawled back again, joining the cluster. They would stay with the queen. It was the only way to survive.<br><br>Shaking from head to toe, Isabel lifted the box. The thing was heavy. Heavier than she had imagined. And the bees seemed agitated. They were moving faster, or maybe that was just her imagination. She wondered if that meant the scouts were returning. A fiery pinching sensation on her shoulder nearly made her lose control. "Ow," she said, "Ow, ow, ow. You're supposed to be docile. What's wrong with you?" She had probably trapped the poor thing under her jumpsuit. To herself, she added, "Slow and careful. I'm supposed to be good at being slow and careful. Too good, if you ask Tess."<br><br>Tess was by far the more impulsive one. Sometimes she got exasperated by Isabel's deliberation and caution.<br><br>The crucial moment was upon her. The next task was to get the swarm into the waiting hive.<br><br>Just then, Charlie gave a <em>woof,</em> stood up and trotted toward the road. She heard the sound of a motor, its pitch different from the humming of the bees. An orchard worker?<br><br>She turned as a banana yellow Jeep with a roll bar and its top down crested the hill, jolting over the rutted track and spitting gravel out the sides of the tires. A flurry of bees erupted from the box. Several landed ominously on the veil covering her face.<br><br>Slow down, she wanted to yell. You're disturbing them.<br><br>The jeep scrabbled to a halt in a cloud of dust, and a long-bodied stranger jumped out, levering himself with the roll bar. He had long hair and big shoulders, and he was wearing army green cargo pants, a black t-shirt and aviator shades.<br><br>Jamie Westfall? Isabel wondered. She wouldn't mind a little help at the moment.<br><br>"This the Johansen place?" asked the deep-voiced stranger.<br><br>Charlie made a chuffing sound and sat back in the grass.<br><br>"Oh good, you got my text," she said, keeping her eyes on the heavy, moving cluster in the box. "Great timing. You're just in time to give me a hand."<br><br>"What, are you high?" he demanded, peering suspiciously as though trying to see her through the veil. "That's a swarm of frickin' bees."<br><br>"Yes, so if you don't mind&#x2014;"<br><br>"Shit, I got stung." He slapped at the side of his neck. "What the hell&#x2014;? Christ, there's a dozen of the little f<em>&#x2014;Jesus Christ."</em> He swore some more as he swatted violently at a few stragglers. He swore a lot. He used swear words to modify his swear words. The swatting motion agitated them further. Isabel felt another fiery pinch, this one on her ankle, where the fabric of her suit ended in a cuff.<br><br>"Be still. You're making them defensive." Some beekeeper, she thought.<br><br>"Oh, you think? Lady, I'm out of here. I am&#x2014;"<br><br>"I thought you came to help." The humming crescendoed, and the swarm in the box moved faster, undulating like a living storm cloud. "Oh, no..." She set down the box and waved her hand at a flurry of bees. The scouts had returned. She felt another sting&#x2014;her wrist this time&#x2014;and set the box on the ground.<br><br>"Shit, look out!" The strange man grabbed her and threw her to the ground, covering her with his body. Charlie gave a sharp bark of warning.<br><br>Panic knifed through Isabel, and the fear had nothing to do with bees. It felt like a cold blade of steel, and suddenly she was lost, hurled back to the past somewhere, to a dark place she never thought she'd escape. <em>"No,"</em> she said in a harsh whisper. She bucked, arching her back like a bow, bringing up one knee and connecting with...something.<br><br>"Oof, holy shit, what the hell's the matter with you?" The guy rolled to one side, drawing his knees up to his chest and holding his crotch. The shades flew from his face as a groan slipped from him.<br><br>Isabel crab walked away, not taking her eyes off him. He was big, he smelled of sweat and road dust, and his eyes reflected a fury of pain. But he hadn't hurt <em>her.</em> She was as startled as he by her overreaction. Easy, she told herself. Take it easy. Her pulse slowed down by degrees, dulled by mortification. Then she tore her gaze from the stranger in time to see the swarm lift up en masse, a thick, spreading veil of heavy silk. The scouts were leading the entire colony off into the wilderness. The dark cloud of insects grew smaller and smaller, sailing away like an untethered balloon.<br><br>"You're too late. They've gone," she said, rubbing her shoulder. Glowering, she stood up, kicking the cardboard box in defeat. A few dead bees tumbled from the now empty ligustrum branch.<br><br>"You can thank me later," the guy said. He was sitting now, too, regarding her with narrowed eyes.<br><br>"Thank you?" she demanded, incredulous.<br><br>"You're welcome?" he returned.<br><br>"What kind of beekeeper are you?"<br><br>"Um, do I <em>look</em> like a beekeeper? I thought that's what you were, unless that headgear is some new style of birka."<br><br>She peeled off the hat and dropped it on the ground. Her hair was plastered to her head and neck by the sweat of her fruitless hard work. "You're not Jamie Westfall?"<br><br>"I don't know who the hell that is. Like I said, I came looking for the Johansen place." He regarded her with probing eyes. She couldn't help but notice the color, deep green, like leaves in the shade. He was ridiculously good-looking, even pock-marked by bee stings.<br><br>"Oh, my gosh," she said, "you're one of the workmen." The tile guy was on the schedule today to finish the majolica tile in the teaching kitchen.<br><br>"If that's how you treat a worker, remind me not to get on your bad side. But no, let's start over." With a groan of discomfort, he got up. For the first time, she noticed a big, hinged brace of some sort on his left knee. "I'm Cormac O'Neill," he said. "I'd shake hands, but you're scary."<br><br>The name meant nothing to her. O'Neill was not on the list of contractors she had been working with over the past year.<br><br>"And you're here because.?"<br><br>"Because, oh Christ...I'm dying." He slapped at his beefy bare arms, his face and neck.<br><br>"What? Come on, I didn't kick you <em>that</em> hard." She turned just in time to see him hit the ground like a dropped sack of potatoes. "Really?" she asked him. <em>"Really?"</em><br><br>"I got stung."<br><br>"I can see that." In addition to the bites on his face, welts had appeared all over his neck and arms and hands. "I'm sorry. But they're honey bees," she said. "It's not like their stings are lethal."<br><br>"Only to people who are highly allergic," he said, trying to sit up and speaking as though his tongue was suddenly thick. A whistling sound came from his throat.<br><br>She knelt down beside him. "You're allergic? Highly allergic?"<br><br>"Anaphylaxis," he said, yanking at the neckline of his t-shirt.<br><br>"If you're so allergic, why did you come running?"<br><br>"You said I was just in time. You said you needed a hand." His throat was bulging, his eyes glazing over. He looked as if he was just inches from dying.<br><br><em>I shouldn't be surprised,</em> thought Isabel. <em>I've never had much luck with men.</em></p><h2>Shadow Flight (A Shadow Riders Novel)</h2><p><b><b>Chicago's Ferraro crime family will do anything to protect one of their own in this thrilling entry in the Shadow Riders series from #1 <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author Christine Feehan.</b></b><br><br>Nicoletta Gomez was a terrified teenager when Taviano Ferraro and his brother saved her life.

I&#x2019;d wanted to lie down, I recall that clearly. I&#x2019;d <i>needed </i>to be done with it. But I hadn&#x2019;t. I&#x2019;d fought the pain, the fatigue, the fucking white light. I&#x2019;d clawed my way back to the land of the living.</p><p>Because of Vero. She needed me.</p><p><i>What have you done?</i></p><p>I am weightless now. I understand, absently, this is not a good thing. Cars shouldn&#x2019;t be weightless. A luxury SUV was never intended to fly. And I smell something sharp and astringent. Alcohol. More specifically, whiskey. Glenlivet. Always prided myself on drinking the good stuff.</p><p><i>What have you done?</i></p><p>I want to cry out. As long as I&#x2019;m sailing through the air, about to die for the second time, I should at least be able to scream. But no sound comes from my throat.</p><p>Instead, I stare through the plunging windshield, out into the pitch black night, and I notice, of all things, that it&#x2019;s raining.</p><p>Like that night. Before...</p><p><i>What have you done?</i></p><p>It is not so bad to fly. The feeling is pleasant, even exhilarating. The limits of gravity defied, the pressure of earthbound life left far behind. I should lift my arms, spread them wide and embrace the second death looming before me.</p><p>Vero.</p><p>Beautiful little Vero.</p><p>And then...</p><p>Gravity takes its revenge. My car is weightless no more as it reconnects savagely with the earth. A shuddering crash. An echoing boom. My body, once in flight, now tossed like a rag doll against steering wheel, dashboard, gear shift. The sound of glass cracking. My face shattering.</p><p>Pain, burning and sharp. Followed by fatigue, crushing and deep. I want lie down. I <i>need </i>to be done with it.</p><p>Vero, I think.</p><p>And then: Oh my God, what have I done?</p><p>My face is wet. I lick my lips tasting water, salt, blood. Slowly, I lift my head, only for my temple to explode in agony. I wince, tucking my chin reflexively against my chest, then rest my aching forehead against hard plastic. The steering wheel of my car, I realize, is now crushed against my chest, while my leg is twisted at a nearly impossible angle, my knee wedged somewhere under the crumpled dash. I have fallen, I think, and I can&#x2019;t get up.</p><p>I hear a sound. Laughter. Or maybe it&#x2019;s keening. It&#x2019;s a strange sound. High-pitched, continuous and not entirely sane.</p><p>It&#x2019;s coming from me.</p><p>More wet. The rain has found its way inside my vehicle. Or I have found a way outside. I&#x2019;m not sure. Whiskey. The stench of alcohol is so strong it makes me want to vomit. Soaked into my shirt, I realize. Then, my gaze still struggling to take in my surroundings, I spy glass fragments scattered around me; the remains of a bottle.</p><p>I should move. Get out. Call someone. Do something.</p><p>My head hurts so damn much, and instead of velvet black sky, I see bursting white lights exploding across my field of vision.</p><p>Vero.</p><p>One word. It rises to the front of my mind. Grounding me. Guiding me. Urging me forward. Vero, Vero, Vero.</p><p>I move. Laboriously, the keening sound replaced by a soul-wrenching scream as I attempt to extricate myself from the driver&#x2019;s seat. My vehicle appears to have landed on its front end, the dash nearly crushed against me. I&#x2019;m not upright, but tilted forward, as if my Audi, once it broke its nose, couldn&#x2019;t regain its balance. It means I have to work doubly hard to unpin myself from the accordionized space between my seat and the steering wheel and the collapsed dash.</p><p>Airbag. The excess mass wraps around my arms, tangles up my hands, and I curse it. Back to screaming and fighting and ranting gibberish, but the senseless rage spikes my adrenaline until at least the crushing fatigue is gone, and now there is only pain, an endless terrible pain I already understand I can&#x2019;t afford to contemplate, as I finally wiggle my way sideways from between the driver&#x2019;s seat and the dash. I collapse, panting heavily, onto the center console. Legs work. Arms, too.</p><p>Head&#x2019;s on fire.</p><p>Vero.</p><p>Smoke. Do I smell smoke? I suffer an immediate bolt of panic. Smoke, screams, fire. Smoke, screams, fire.</p><p>Vero, Vero, Vero.</p><p><i>Run!</i></p><p>No. I catch myself. No smoke. That was the first time. How many times can a woman die? I&#x2019;m not sure. It&#x2019;s a blur in my head, from the smell of wet earth to the heat of flames. All separate and yet together. I am dying. I am dead. No, I am merely dying. No wait, I am dead. The first time, the second time, the third?</p><p>I can&#x2019;t sort it out.</p><p>Only one thing matters, has ever mattered. Vero. I must save Vero.</p><p>Back seat. I twist myself around. I hit first my left knee, then my right, and scream again. Knees are shot. Fuck it. Don&#x2019;t care. Back seat. I have to get to the back seat.</p><p>I fumble around in the dark, licking rain and mud from my lips as other impressions start to register. The front windshield is shattered, but also the moon roof, hence the inside rain. My once gorgeous, relatively new and luxurious Audi Q5 crossover SUV has been shortened by at least a foot, if not two, the front end sustaining the worst of the impact and the front doors most likely too warped to open. But the back appears to be relatively intact.</p><p>&#x201c;Vero, Vero, Vero.&#x201d;</p><p>I realize for the first time I am wearing gloves. Or, used to be wearing gloves. The glass has shredded them into large bloody flaps which hinder my movements. I wrestle the first one off, then the second, then jam them self-consciously in my pants pocket. Can&#x2019;t toss them on the floor. That would be littering and I treat my car better than that. Used to treat my car better than that?</p><p>My head hurts so damn much. I want to curl up in a ball and sleep and sleep and sleep.</p><p>But I don&#x2019;t. I can&#x2019;t. Vero.</p><p>Forcing myself to move once more, I rummage right, then left, fingers fumbling in the dark. But I find nothing. No one. I search and search, first the back seat, then, more shakily, the floor. But no small body magically appears.</p><p>What if... She could&#x2019;ve been thrown, tossed from the airborne vehicle. The car had tried to fly, and maybe so had Vero.</p><p><i>Mommy, look at me. I&#x2019;m an airplane.</i></p><p>What have I done, what have I done, what have I done?<br><br>I must get out of the vehicle. Nothing else matters. Out there, something in the dark, the rain, the mud. Vero. I must save her.</p><p>I drag myself by the elbows from the front of my crumpled car to the back. Then, a sharp turn for the rear passenger&#x2019;s door. But it won&#x2019;t open. I yank the handle, shove against the door. Cry, beg, and plead, but nothing. It won&#x2019;t give. The damage, the child&#x2019;s safety lock. <i>Shit!</i></p><p>One other exit. The way back, rear cargo hatch. Moving again, painfully slow as the pain in my head turns to nausea in my stomach, and I know I&#x2019;m going to vomit, but I don&#x2019;t care. I have to get out of this car. I have to find Vero.</p><p>The puke, when it comes, is a thin liquid spew that smells of expensive single malt and a long night&#x2019;s regret.</p><p>I drag myself through the heinous puddle and keep going. First lucky break: the collision has jarred the rear hatch open.</p><p>I push it the rest of the way up. Then, when crawling proves too much for my bruised&#x2014;broken?&#x2014;ribs, I drag myself out with my arms and belly flop onto the ground. Mud, soft and oozing, eases my fall. I roll over, panting from the pain, the force of my exertions, the hopelessness of my situation.</p><p><i>Rain, rain go away, please come back some other day.</i></p><p><i>Mommy, look at me, I&#x2019;m an airplane</i>.</p><p>I&#x2019;m tired again. Fatigue, crushing and deep. I could just lie here. Help will come. Someone who saw the accident, heard the crash. Another motorist passing by. Or maybe someone will miss me. Someone who cares.</p><p>An image of a man&#x2019;s face pops into my mind, but is gone before I can catch it.</p><p>&#x201c;Vero,&#x201d; I whisper. To the falling rain, the oozing mud, the starless night.</p><p>The smell of smoke, I think idly. The heat of fire. No, that was the first time. Focus, dammit. Focus!</p><p>I roll back over, and begin my journey.</p><p>The road appears to be high above me. There is mud, grass, scraggly bushes, and sharp rocks between it and me. I hear distant sounds, cars whizzing above me, like exotic birds and I realize, as I belly crawl forward inch by inch, that the vehicles are too far away. They are up; I am down. They will never see me. They will never stop and help me find Vero.</p><p>Another inch, two, three, four. Gasping as I hit a rock. Cursing as I tangle in a bush. My trembling fingers reaching forward, searching, searching, searching. While my head screams in agony and I pause, time after time, to retch pathetic little spits of bile.</p><p>Vero.</p><p>And then: <i>Oh, Nicky</i>, <i>what have you done?</i></p><p>I hear that keening noise again but I don&#x2019;t stop. I don&#x2019;t want to realize that the distressed animal making all those sounds is actually me.</p><p>I don&#x2019;t know how long I wriggle myself up through the slipping, sliding mud. I know by the time I crest the hill, I&#x2019;m covered head to toe in black ooze and far from disturbing me, it amuses me. It&#x2019;s fitting, I think. I look as I ought to look.</p><p>Like a woman who&#x2019;s crawled from the grave.</p><p>Lights. Twin pinpricks, looming closer. I get up on my hands and knees now. Have to, if the passing motorist is to see me. And it&#x2019;s okay, because my ribs don&#x2019;t hurt anymore. My body has gone numb, the screaming in my head having overloaded all circuits and left everything else curiously blank.</p><p>Maybe I&#x2019;m already dead. Maybe this is what the dead look like, as I get one foot beneath me, and slowly but surely, rise to standing.</p><p>A screech of brakes. The oncoming car, fishtailing briefly as the driver overapplies the brakes in the wet conditions. Then, miraculously, it stops, right before my raised hand and pale, rain-streaked face.</p><p>&#x201c;Holy&#x2014;&#x201d; An elderly man, clearly shaken, is briefly illuminated by the interior light as he opens the driver&#x2019;s side door. He steps out uncertainly, rises to standing. &#x201c;Ma&#x2019;am, are you all right?&#x201d;</p><p>I don&#x2019;t say a word.</p><p>&#x201c;Is it an accident? Where&#x2019;s your car? Ma&#x2019;am, you want me to dial nine-one-one?&#x201d;</p><p>I don&#x2019;t say a word.</p><p>I just think: Vero.</p><p>And suddenly, I remember. I remember everything. An enormous explosion of light, terror and rage. A shooting pain not only through my head, but through my heart. And in that instant, I recall exactly who I am. The monster from underneath the bed.</p><p>Across from me, as if sensing my thoughts, the old man recoils, takes a small step back.</p><p>&#x201c;Um...just stay there, ma&#x2019;am. Just...I&#x2019;ll um, I&#x2019;ll phone for help.&#x201d;</p><p>The man disappears back inside the dimly lit interior of his car. I don&#x2019;t say anything. I stand in the rain, swaying on my feet.</p><p>I think, one last time: Vero.</p><p>Then the moment is gone, the memory passed.</p><p>And I am no one at all, just a woman twice returned from the dead.</p></p><h2>Master Book of Candle Burning</h2><p>The Master Book of Candle Burning outlines the practices used and taught by mediums, spiritual advisors, evangelists, and others who use candles and psalms to help in money drawing rituals, love spells, and other such spells.</p><p></p><h2>The Collected Poems of Wallace Stevens: The Corrected Edition (Vintage International)</h2><p><p><i>The Collected Poems</i> of Wallace Stevens is the definitive collection from the man Harold Bloom has called &#x201c;the best and most representative American poet.&#x201d; <br><br>Originally published in 1954 to honor Stevens&#x2019;s seventy-fifth birthday, the book was rushed into print for the occasion and contained scores of errors.

Here is stunning evidence that Sid Jacobson and Ernie Colï¿½n, with more than sixty years of experience in the comic-book industry between them, were right: far, far too few Americans have read, grasped, and demanded action on the Commission's investigation into the events of that tragic day and the lessons America must learn.</p><p>Using every skill and storytelling method Jacobson and Colï¿½n have learned over the decades, they have produced the most accessible version of the 9/11 Report. Jacobson's text frequently follows word for word the original report, faithfully captures its investigative thoroughness, and covers its entire scope, even including the Commission's final report card. Colï¿½n's stunning artwork powerfully conveys the facts, insights, and urgency of the original. Published on the fifth anniversary of the terrorist attacks on the United States, an event that has left no aspect of American foreign or domestic policy untouched, <i>The 9/11 Report </i>puts at every American's fingertips the most defining event of the century.</p></p><p><p><b>Sid Jacobson </b>was the managing editor and editor in chief for Harvey Comics, where he created Richie Rich, and executive editor at Marvel Comics.</p><p>The artist, <b>Ernie </b><b>Colï¿½n</b>, has worked at Harvey, Marvel, and DC Comics. At DC, he oversaw the production of Green Lantern, Wonder Woman, Blackhawk, and the Flash; at Marvel, Spider-Man.</p>Adult/High School&#x2013;At only 15 percent the size of <i>The 9/11 Report: The National Commission on Terrorist Attacks upon the United States</i> (St. Martin's, 2004) and more than four times the price, is this adaptation worth purchasing? The answer is an unequivocal yes. Jacobson and Colï¿½n intend this adaptation to bring to the commission's report readers who would not or could not digest its nearly 800 pages, and they have the blessing, acknowledged in this book's foreword, of the commission's chair and vice-chair to do so. Neither lurid nor simplistic, it presents the essence of the commission's work in a manner that, especially in the opening section, is able to surpass aspects of any text-only publication: the four stories of the doomed flights are given on the same foldout pages so that readers can truly grasp the significance of how simultaneous events can and did overwhelm our national information and defense systems. The analysis that follows in the subsequent 11 chapters cuts cleanly to the kernels of important history, politics, economics, and procedural issues that both created and exacerbated the effects of the day's events. Colï¿½n's full-color artwork provides personality for the named players&#x2013;U.S. presidents and Al-Qaeda operatives alike&#x2013;as well as the airline passengers, office workers, fire fighters, and bureaucrats essential to the report. This graphic novel has the power and accessibility to become a high school text; in the meantime, no library should be without it.<i>&#x2013;Francisca Goldsmith, Berkeley Public Library, CA</i> <br>Copyright ï¿½ Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

In this highly personal and witty book, renowned philosopher Roger Scruton explains how to live as a conservative in spite of the pressures to exist otherwise. Drawing on his own experience as a counter-cultural presence in public life, Scruton argues that while humanity might survive in the absence of the conservative outlook, it certainly won't flourish. <i>How to be a Conservative</i> is not only a blueprint for modern conservatism. It is a heartfelt appeal on behalf of old fashioned decencies and values, which are the bedrock of our weakened, but still enduring civilization.</p></p><p>Professor Roger Scruton is a graduate of Jesus College, Cambridge. He has been Professor of Aesthetics at Birkbeck College, London, and University Professor at Boston University. He is currently visiting professor of philosophy at the University of Oxford and Senior Fellow at the Ethics and Public Policy Center, Washington DC.

Credited with single-handedly rejuvenating the rapidly declining American steel industry to the status of world-class producer, Iverson is one of the most successful and, as he likes to point out, one of the lowest-paid CEOs in the U.S. In his long-awaited book, Ken Iverson shares his ideas, observations, and the lessons he&#39;s learned about what it takes to grow a super-competitive, world-class organization.</p><p><p><b>Ken Iverson</b> was an American businessman. He is credited with transforming Nucor Steel from a nearly bankrupt company in the 1960s into the largest and most successful steelmaker in the United States. Trained as a metallurgist, he became a successful leader and businessman.</p>"Ken Iverson is a leader whose vision shaped an industry and the future, a leader whose character, values, and ethics merge seamlessly with the mission and values of a successful, innovative business." -Frances Hesselbein, President and CEO, The Peter F. Drucker Foundation<br> <br> Ken Iverson taught us that America could compete in a tough global economy. He did it in an industry where being a maverick was the only way. His accounting of Nucor's story should serve as a blue print or us all. -David Glass, President and CEO, WalMart Stores, Inc.<br> <br> No theory; just important, practical ideas proven by Ken Iverson in the furnace at Nucor.-Peter Larson, Chairman and CEO, Brunswick Corporation<br> <br> It is a masterpiece! Plain Talk provides a penetrating analysis of why Nucor has performed so well for so long, full of insights and solid conclusions. The book is easy to follow, very well written, and a 'must' read for every executive...a major contribution to business. -Vijay Govindarajan, Earl C. Dum 1924 Professor of International Business, Amos Tuck School of Business Administration, DartmouthCollege<br> <br> This is a story about Ken Iverson, a man who built a major steel company from ground zero, much of it during a period when the U.S. steel industry was losing 25% of its capacity. But most of all, it's about motivating people to a level of remarkable accomplishment. You will enjoy reading this book as much as the people who work for Nucor enjoy being there.-James F.

White culture is very real. In fact, when white culture comes in contact with other cultures, it almost always wins. So it would be a really good idea for you to learn about your culture."</em> Confused and unsettled by this encounter, Hill began a journey of understanding his own white identity. Today he is an active participant in addressing and confronting racial and systemic injustices. And in this compelling and timely book, he shows you the seven stages to expect on your own path to cultural awakening. It's crucial to understand both personal and social realities in the areas of race, culture, and identity. This book will give you a new perspective on being white and also empower you to be an agent of reconciliation in our increasingly diverse and divided world.</p><p>Daniel Hill is the founding and senior pastor of River City Community Church, a vibrant, multiethnic church in the Humboldt Park neighborhood of Chicago. He is the author of <em>10:10: Life to the Fullest</em>. Prior to starting River City, Daniel worked in the business world before serving five years on the staff of Willow Creek Community Church in the Chicago suburbs. He has a business degree from Purdue University, an MA in theology from Moody Bible Institute, a certificate in church-based community and economic development from Harvard Divinity School, and a DMin from Northern Baptist Theological Seminary. He is married to Elizabeth, who is a professor of psychology, and they are the proud parents of two children."<em>White Awake</em> is a profoundly pastoral book with serious implications for the ecclesial, social, and political life of our nation. At a time when conversations about race seem increasingly cross-pressured by various interests and motivations, readers can trust Daniel Hill to tell them the truth about racism and white supremacy. Hill does not use these fraught issues to manipulate, but rather to help his readers see more clearly. If Christians read and consider this book carefully, it will help them. It helped me. I'm grateful to Daniel for writing <em>White Awake</em>." (Michael Wear, author of Reclaiming Hope)<br><br>"Daniel Hill's personal and deep dive into whiteness, reconciliation, and the dividing lines in our social matrix of race is needed like never before. At a time of ongoing racial weariness and colorblind responses, I'm so grateful for this resource. Allow the transparency and courage of this book to lead you into the needed work of unity, liberation, and justice." (Efrem Smith, author of Killing Us Softly and The Post-Black and Post-White Church)<br><br>"<em>White Awake</em> is at once personal, practical, and provocative. Well conceived, researched, and written, this timely book provides a detailed consideration of cultural identity and its formation from which everyone can benefit&#x2015;particularly those of us who are white and willing to engage the topic not only for our own benefit but, more significantly, for the sake of the gospel, as ambassadors of Christ and ministers of reconciliation in an increasingly diverse society. Indeed, it is long past time for us to reflect deeply and responsibly on race, racialization, and reconciliation. With refreshing honesty and only the best of intentions, Daniel has provided us with a means to do just that." (Mark DeYmaz, founding pastor of Mosaic Church, author of Building a Healthy Multi-Ethnic Church)<br><br>"Rarely have I run across a book written with more humility than what Daniel Hill accomplishes in <em>White Awake</em>. I was surprised from the first chapter all the way through the end, not with Daniel's intellectual grasp of the topic (although it's incredibly strong), but with his ability to walk circumspectly and see himself as the primary student in his story. <em>White Awake</em> offers . . . a practical and clear path for others to navigate the experience, disorientation, and ultimate awakening that comes with deep reflection on white racial identity. This book has rightfully earned a place on my bookshelf and in my list of recommended books&#x2015;I'm confident it will earn a similar spot in yours as well." (Ken Wytsma, founder of The Justice Conference, author of The Myth of Equality and Create vs. Copy)<br><br>"Daniel Hill sought me out as a mentor over two decades ago, and it has been a joy to watch the progress of him and his church. Now, in <em>White Awake</em>, he shares lessons learned on his journey of following Jesus into the ministry of reconciliation. As Christians in this day and age, we need to all think critically and closely examine the teachings of Scripture. In this book, you will find fresh thinking around the critical topic of race, and I would encourage every Christian to read it." (John M. Perkins, author, cofounder of the Christian Community Development Association)<br><br>"In <em>White Awake</em>, Rev. Dr. Daniel Hill divulges his most intimate experiences of whiteness and how white privilege impacts our society. He thoughtfully uncovers cultural identity, social constructions of race, and colorblindness in a manner that is both provoking and enlightening on the pressing social reality for people of color. Hill offers seven stages to a ministry of reconciliation as he invites us to wander away from our comfort zones and challenge us to become informed new beings. <em>White Awake</em> is a crucial book for our time, as the social and political landscape progresses into torrential territories. This book is challenging, provocative, and significant, and I strongly recommend it." (Grace Ji-Sun Kim, associate professor of theology, Earlham School of Religion, author of several books, including Embracing the Other and Mother Daughter Speak)<br><br>"Daniel Hill has been my friend for almost two decades, and with each passing year, I learn more from him and admire him more. His passion, intelligence, and depth are gifts to the community he pastors and to the city of Chicago, and this book is a wise and helpful guide for all of us who want to learn more about both the theology and practice of reconciliation in America today." (Shauna Niequist, New York Times&#x2013;bestselling author of Present Over Perfect)<br><br>"For about two decades, Daniel Hill has been wrestling with what it means to be a white man in America and a white pastor in the city of Chicago. He is fearlessly curious and inquisitive. When things get uncomfortable, he leans in. This book is Daniel's invitation to lean in to the current moment and join the movement for racial justice&#x2015;lest we discover a generation from now that we slept through a revolution." (Shane Claiborne, author and activist)<br><br>"In <em>White Awake</em>, Daniel Hill humbly and insightfully shares his personal journey of understanding race and privilege. He provides a practical and challenging look at the blinders and barriers that hinder racial reconciliation and our ability to advocate for equity and justice for all. I am grateful for this resource that helped me better understand where I am in my own journey and how I can more effectively challenge myself and my church to be active participants in furthering the Jesus mission of reconciliation and restoration." (Dave Ferguson, lead pastor, Community Christian Church, lead visionary, NewThing)<br><br>"Many evangelicals of color have grown weary of ringing the bell and issuing the clarion call for racial justice. While we do not look for white evangelicals to legitimize or affirm our perspective, it's nice on occasion to know that there are 'woke' white evangelicals out there. It's nice to know that these efforts have not been in vain. Daniel Hill has been my friend and ally for many years. In this book, you will have the chance to hear his story and heart&#x2015;and learn from a learner." (Soong-Chan Rah, Milton B.

While watching <i>The Magnificent Seven, </i>Nayeli decides to go north herself and recruit seven men--her own "Siete Magnï¿½ficos"--to repopulate her hometown and protect it from the bandidos who plan on taking it over.&nbsp;<br><br>Filled with unforgettable characters and prose as radiant as the Sinaloan sun, <em>Into the Beautiful North</em> is the story of an irresistible young woman's quest to find herself on both sides of the fence.</p><p>Luis Alberto Urrea is the author of <i>The Devil's Highway</i>, <i>The Hummingbirds Daughter</i>, and <em>Across the Wire</em>.&nbsp;Winner of a Lannan Literary Award,&nbsp;and the Christopher Award, he is also the recipient of an American Book Award, a Western States Book Award, and a&nbsp;Colorado Book Award. In 2001, Luis was inducted into the Latino&nbsp;Literary Hall of Fame.You can almost hear the opening theme to the classic American Western THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN, the movie that inspires the lovely 19-year-old Nayeli to gather together a ragtag group of friends and set out on a mission. Their goal is to cross the Mexican border into the U.S. and recruit seven men, including her father, to help repopulate her village and save them from evil banditos. Narrator Susan Ericksen ably portrays each heartfelt character and delivers Spanish with confidence and ease.

He is the coauthor of <i>The Sea Hunters</i> and <i>The Sea Hunters II</i>.<b>Chapter One</b> <br><br>LIEUTENANT CHRIS HUNT rarely talked about his past, but the men he served with had gathered a few clues from his demeanor. The first was that Hunt had not grown up in some backwoods hillbilly haven and used the army to see the world. He was from Southern California. And, if pressed, Hunt would volunteer he was raised in the <i>Los Angeles area</i>, not wanting to disclose that he grew up in Beverly Hills. The second thing the men noticed was that Hunt was a natural leader-he was neither patronizing nor put on an air of superiority, but neither did he try to hide the fact that he was competent and smart. <br><br> The third thing the men found out today. <br><br> A chill wind was blowing down from the mountains into the Afghanistan valley where the platoon under Hunt's command was breaking camp. Hunt and three other soldiers were wrestling with a tent they were folding for storage. While the men were bringing the ends together longways, Sergeant Tom Agnes decided to ask about the rumor he had heard. Hunt handed him the side of the tent so Agnes could fold it into halves. <br><br> "Sir," Agnes said, "rumor has it you graduated from Yale University-that true?" <br><br> All the men were wearing tinted ski goggles but Agnes was close enough to see Hunt's eyes. A flicker of surprise, followed by resignation, flashed quickly. Then Hunt smiled. <br><br> "Ah," he said quietly, "you've found out my terrible secret." <br><br> Agnes nodded and folded the tent in half. "Not exactly a hotbed for military recruiting." <br><br> "George Bush went there," Hunt said. "He was a navy pilot." <br><br> "I thought he was in the National Guard," Specialist Jesus Herrara, who was taking the tent from Agnes, said. <br><br> "George Bush Senior," Hunt said. "Our president also graduated from Yale, and yes, he was a National Guard jet pilot." <br><br> "Yale," Agnes said. "If you don't mind me asking, how did you end up here?" <br><br> Hunt brushed some snow from his gloves. "I volunteered," he said, "just like you." <br><br> Agnes nodded. <br><br> "Now let's finish breaking down this camp," Hunt said, pointing to the mountain nearby, "and head up there and find that bastard who attacked the United States." <br><br> "Yes, sir," the men said in unison. <br><br> Ten minutes later, with fifty-pound packs on their backs, they started up the mountain.<br> IN A TOWN where beautiful women abound, at age forty-nine Michelle Hunt still caused men to turn their heads. Tall, with hazel hair and bluegreen eyes, she was blessed with a figure that required neither constant dieting nor endless exercise to appear trim. Her lips were full and her teeth straight, but it was her doelike eyes and flawless skin that gave the strongest visual impression. And while she was a beautiful woman, that was as common in Southern California as sunshine and earthquakes. <br><br> What drew people closer to Michelle was something that cannot be created by a surgeon's knife, honed through dress or manicure, or developed through ambition or change. Michelle had that thing that made both men and women like her and want to be around her-she was happy, content and positive. Michelle Hunt was herself. And people flocked to her like bees to a flower in bloom. <br><br> "Sam," she said to the painter who had just finished the walls in her art gallery, "you do such nice work." <br><br> Sam was thirty-eight years old and he blushed. <br><br> "Only my best for you, Ms. Hunt," he said. <br><br> Sam had painted her gallery when it had opened five years before, her Beverly Hills house, her condo in Lake Tahoe and now this remodel. And every time she made him feel appreciated and talented. <br><br> "You want a bottle of water or a Coke or something?" she asked. <br><br> "I'm okay, thanks." <br><br> Just then an assistant called from the front of the gallery that she had a telephone call, and she smiled, waved and began to walk away. <br><br> "That's a lady," Sam said under his breath, "a lady." <br><br> Walking to the front of the gallery, where her desk faced out onto Rodeo Drive, Michelle noticed that one of the artists she represented was coming through the front door. Here her amiability had also paid off in spades-artists are a fickle and temperamental lot, but Michelle's artists adored her and rarely changed galleries. That and the fact that she had started her business fully funded had contributed greatly to her years of success. <br><br> "I knew today was going to be good," she said to the bearded man. "I just didn't know it would be because my favorite artist would be paying me a visit." <br><br> The man smiled. <br><br> "Just let me take this telephone call," she said, "and we'll talk." <br><br> Her aide corralled the artist toward an area with couches and a wet bar off to one side. As Michelle slid into her desk chair and reached for the telephone, the aide took the artist's drink order and a few seconds later began packing ground espresso into the machine to draw him a cappuccino. <br><br> "Michelle Hunt." <br><br> "It's me," a gravelly voice said. <br><br> The voice was one that needed no introduction. He had swept her off her feet when she was a young woman of twenty-one, freshly arrived from Minnesota, seeking a new life of fun and sun in 1980s Southern California. After an on-again, off-again relationship, necessitated both by his inability to be bound to a relationship, as well as his frequent absences for business, she had borne his son at age twenty-four. And though his name never appeared on the birth certificate-nor had Michelle and he actually lived together before or since-the pair had remained close. At least as close as the man allowed anyone ever to come. <br><br> "How are you?" she asked. <br><br> "I've been okay." <br><br> "Where are you?" <br><br> It was the standard question she asked him to break the ice. Over the years the answers had ranged from Osaka to Peru to Paris to Tahiti. <br><br> "Hang on," the man said easily. He stared at a moving map on a forward wall near the cockpit of his jet. "Six hundred and eighty-seven miles from Honolulu on the way to Vancouver, British Columbia." <br><br> "Going skiing?" she asked. The sport was something they had enjoyed together. <br><br> "Building a skyscraper," he answered. <br><br> "You're always up to something." <br><br> "True," he noted. "Michelle, I called because I heard our boy has been sent to Afghanistan," he said quietly. <br><br> Michelle had been unaware-the deployment was still secret and Chris had not been able to disclose his destination when he'd been dispatched. <br><br> "Oh my," she blurted, "that's not good." <br><br> "That's what I thought you'd say." <br><br> "How'd you find out?" Michelle asked. "I'm always amazed by your ability to ferret out information." <br><br> "It's not magic," the man said. "I have so many senators and other politicians in my pocket I've had to buy larger pants." <br><br> "Any word on how it's going?" <br><br> "I guess the mission is proving harder than the president envisioned," he said. "Chris is apparently leading a hunter-killer squad to locate the bad guys. Limited contact so far-but my sources claim it is cold and dirty work. If he doesn't contact you for a while, don't be surprised." <br><br> "I'm afraid for him," Michelle said slowly. <br><br> "Do you want me to put in a fix?" the man asked. "Have him pulled out and sent stateside?" <br><br> "I thought he made you agree never to do that." <br><br> "He did," the man admitted. <br><br> "Then don't." <br><br> "I'll call you when I know more." <br><br> "Are you going to be down this way soon?" Michelle asked. <br><br> "I'll call you if I am," the man said. "Now I'd better go-I'm starting to get static on the satellite line. Must be sunspots." <br><br> "Pray our boy is safe," she said. <br><br> "I might do more than that," the man said as the call ended. <br><br> Michelle replaced the receiver in its cradle and sat back. Her ex-beau was not one to show worry or fear. Still, his concern for his son had been palpable and personal. She could only hope his worry was misplaced, and that Chris would come home soon. <br><br> Rising from the desk, she walked toward the artist. "Tell me you have something good," she said easily. <br><br> "Outside in the van," the artist said, "and I think you'll like it."<br> FOUR HOURS AFTER sunrise, one thousand feet higher up the ridge from the camp where they had spent the night, Hunt's platoon met a determined enemy. The fire came from a series of caves just above and to the east. And it came all at once. Rifle fire, rocket-propelled grenades, mortars, handgun fire rained down. The enemy dynamited the mountain to create rock slides, pelting the ground below, and they had mined the ground where Hunt's troops sought refuge. <br><br> The enemy's goal was to wipe out Hunt's team all at once-and they would come close. <br><br> Hunt had taken refuge behind a series of boulders. Bullets were ricocheting off the rocks to all sides, sending chips flying through the air and striking his men. There was nowhere to hide, no way to advance, and their retreat had been cut off by a rock slide. <br><br> "Radio," Hunt shouted. <br><br> Half his team was twenty yards ahead, another quarter ahead and to the left. Luckily, his radio operator had stayed close to the lieutenant. The man edged toward Hunt on his back to protect the radio. For his effort he received a wound to his kneecap when a bullet grazed his raised knee as the man pushed himself closer. Hunt dragged him the rest of the way. <br><br> "Antencio," Hunt shouted to a man a few feet away, "take care of Lassiter's wound." <br><br> Antencio scurried over and began cutting away the radio operator's pants. He found the opening was not deep and began to wrap a bandage around the knee as Hunt flicked on the radio and adjusted the dial. <br><br> "You're going to be okay, Lassiter," he said to the radio operator. "I'm going to get us some help in here posthaste. Then we'll have you medevaced." <br><br> The fear in the soldiers' faces was obvious. For most of them, as for Hunt, this was their first time in battle. As their leader, he needed to take control and form a plan. <br><br> "Control, Control, Advance Three," Hunt yelled into the microphone, "need positive support, grid three zero one eight. Taking heavy fire." <br><br> "Advance Three," a voice said immediately, "report situation." <br><br> "We're pinned down," Hunt said, "and they have the high ground. Situation critical." <br><br> Hunt glanced up as he was talking. A dozen bearded men in flowing robes were starting down the hill. "Get some fire up there, men," he screamed to the forward half of his team. A second later a volley of shots rang out. <br><br> "Advance Three, we have a Spectre two minutes out and inbound. Four whirlies-two carriers and two gunships-will be off the ground in three. It'll take them another ten minutes to reach your site." <br><br> Hunt could hear the whine of the massive propeller-driven gunship racing up the canyon miles below them. He peeked over the rock to see eight of the enemy still advancing down the hill. Raising himself, he shot off a rocket-propelled grenade. A whoosh then a thump as the charge flew through the air and ignited. He followed up with a volley of automatic weapon fire. <br><br> "Advance Three, acknowledge." <br><br> "Advance Three, affirmative," Hunt yelled into the microphone. <br><br> Where there had been eight there were now just four. They were only twenty yards from his forward team. Hunt swiveled his bayonet and locked it in place. The forward team seemed paralyzed. They were young, unseasoned and about to be overrun. A mortar landed close to the boulders and exploded. The area was showered with powdered rock and dust. From higher up the mountain another group of the enemy started down the hill. Hunt stood up and started firing. He sprinted the twenty yards ahead to his men and met the advancing enemy head-on. <br><br> Three's a charm, and that's how many Hunt shot dead in the gut. The last one he bayoneted, as his clip was empty. Tasking his sidearm from his holster, he finished the man off, then slid to the ground, replaced his clip and rose and started firing again. <br><br> "Back it up, men," he shouted, "behind the boulders." <br><br> Two by two his men retreated to the relative safety of the boulders to the rear, while the men remaining kept fire on an advancing enemy. The enemy was high on distilled poppy, misplaced religious zeal and the narcotic khat leaves they were chewing. The slope was red with the blood of their fallen comrades but still they advanced. <br><br> "Advance Three," the radio squawked. <br><br> Antencio reached for the radio. "This is Advance Three," he said. "Our C.O. is away from the radio, this is Specialist 367." <br><br> "We've located a B-52 at another target," the voice said. "We've diverted her to assist." <br><br> "Affirm-I'll tell the lieutenant." <br><br> But Antencio would never have a chance to relay the message. <br><br> Only Hunt and a grizzled old sergeant were left at the forward site when the AC-130 arrived on station. A second later a wall of lead began pouring from the 25-, 40- and 105-millimeter guns that poked from her sides. <br><br> The sergeant had seen a Spectre live-fire before and he wasted no time. "Let's back it up, sir," he shouted to Hunt, "we have a few seconds of cover." <br><br> "Go, go, go," Hunt said, yanking the sergeant upright and pushing him toward safety. "I'm right behind you." <br><br> The Spectre crabbed sideways from the recoil of her firing guns. A few seconds later the pilot pulled her up and out to turn and make another pass through the narrow canyon. As the gunship ended her turn and lined up for her second run, seven of the enemy still advanced. Hunt covered his sergeant's retreat. <br><br> He killed five of the enemy with a combination of a rocket-propelled grenade and a concentrated field of fire. But two made it close to Hunt's position. One shot him in the shoulder as he turned to retreat. <br><br> The second one slit his throat with a wicked-looking curved knife. <br><br> Starting down in the dive for the fire run, the pilot of the AC-130 saw Hunt being killed and radioed it to the other aircraft. Hunt's troops saw it as well-and the sight removed their fear and replaced it with rage. As the AC-130 lined up for the pass, the troops rose and charged another wave that had just left the cave and was advancing downhill. Pushing forward as a team, they reached their fallen leader and erected a protective circle around his body. They waited for the enemy to advance, but as if by magic, or sensing the fury of the American troops, the enemy began to turn and retreat.<br> TWENTY THOUSAND FEET above them and less than ten minutes from the target, the pilot of the B-52 flicked off the microphone and replaced it in its cradle. <br><br> "Did you all hear that?" he said quietly on the intercom to his crew. <br><br> The plane was silent save for the drone from the eight engines. The pilot didn't need an answer-he knew they'd all heard what he had heard. <br><br> "We're going to turn this mountain into dust," he said. "When the enemy comes for the bodies, I want them to need to collect them with a sponge." <br><br> * * *<br> FOUR MINUTES LATER the helicopters came for Advance Three.</p><h2>A Homework Manual for Biblical Living: Personal and Interpersonal Problems (Homework Manual for Biblical Living, Volume 1)</h2><p>Counselors needing specific assignments to give counselees, or individuals seeking practical helps for their own struggles will welcome Wayne Mack&#39;s homework manuals.

Visit ArmandoLucasCorrea.com.The German Girl Hannah<p></p> Berlin, 1939<p></p> <br>I was almost twelve years old when I decided to kill my parents.<br> <br>I had made up my mind. I&#x2019;d go to bed and wait until they fell asleep. That was always easy to tell because Papa would lock the big, heavy double windows and close the thick greenish-bronze curtains. He&#x2019;d repeat the same things he said every night after supper, which in those days had become little more than a steaming bowl of tasteless soup.<br> <br>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s nothing to be done. It&#x2019;s all over. We have to leave.&#x201d;<br> <br>Then Mama would start shouting, her voice cracking as she blamed him. She&#x2019;d pace the whole apartment&#x2014;her fortress at the heart of a sinking city; the only space she&#x2019;d known for more than four months&#x2014;until she wore herself out. Then she&#x2019;d embrace Papa, and her feeble moans would finally cease.<br> <br>I&#x2019;d wait a couple of hours. They wouldn&#x2019;t put up any resistance. I knew Papa had already given up and was willing to go. Mama would be more difficult, but she took so many sleeping pills, she&#x2019;d be fast asleep, steeped in her jasmine and geranium essences. Although she had gradually increased the dose, she still awakened during the night crying. I would rush to see what had happened, but all I could make out through the half-open door was Mama inconsolable in Papa&#x2019;s arms, like a little girl recovering from a terrible nightmare. Except that, for her, the nightmare was being awake.<br> <br>Nobody heard my cries anymore; nobody bothered about them. Papa told me I was strong. I would survive whatever happened. But not Mama. The pain was gnawing away at her. She was the child in a house where daylight was no longer allowed. For four months, she had been sobbing each night, ever since the city was covered in broken glass and filled with the constant stench of gunpowder, metal, and smoke. That was when they started planning our escape. They decided we&#x2019;d abandon the house where I was born, and forbade me to go to school, where nobody liked me anymore. Then Papa gave me my second camera.<br> <br>&#x201c;So that you can leave a trail out of the labyrinth like Ariadne,&#x201d; he whispered.<br> <br>I dared to think it would be best to be rid of them.<br> <br>I thought about diluting aspirin in Papa&#x2019;s food or stealing Mama&#x2019;s sleeping pills&#x2014;she wouldn&#x2019;t last a week without them. The only problem was, first of all, my doubts. How many aspirin would he have to swallow to give him a lethal ulcer, internal bleeding? How long could Mama really survive without sleep? Anything bloody was out of the question, because I couldn&#x2019;t bear the sight of blood. So the best thing would be for them to die of suffocation. To smother them with a huge feather pillow. Mama made it clear that her dream had always been for death to take her by surprise while she slept. &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t bear farewells,&#x201d; she would say, staring straight at me&#x2014;or, if I wasn&#x2019;t listening, she would grab me by the arm and squeeze it with the little strength she had left.<br> <br>One night I woke up during the night in tears, thinking my crime had already been committed. I could see my parents&#x2019; lifeless bodies but was unable to shed a single tear. I felt free. Now there would be no one to force me to move to a filthy neighborhood, to leave behind my books, my photographs, my cameras, to live with the terror of being poisoned by your own father and mother.<br> <br>I started to tremble. I called out &#x201c;Papa!&#x201d; But no one came to my rescue. &#x201c;Mama!&#x201d; There was no going back. What had I turned into? How did I end up so low? What would I do with their bodies? How long would it take for them to decompose?<br> <br>Everyone would think it was suicide. No one would question it. My parents had been suffering constantly for four months by then. Others would see me as an orphan; I&#x2019;d see myself as a murderer. My crime existed in the dictionary. I looked it up. What a dreadful word. Just saying it gave me the shivers. Parricide. I tried to repeat it and couldn&#x2019;t. I was a murderer.<br> <br>It was so easy to identify my crime, my guilt, my agony. What about my parents, who were planning to get rid of me? What was the name for someone who killed their children? Was that such a terrible crime there wasn&#x2019;t even a word for it in the dictionary? That meant they could get away with it. Whereas I had to bear the weight of death and a nauseating word. You could kill your parents, your brothers and sisters. But not your children.<br> <br>I prowled through the rooms, which to me seemed increasingly small and dark, in a house that would soon no longer be ours. I looked up at the unreachable ceiling, walked down hallways lined with the images of a family that was disappearing little by little. Light from the lamp with the snowy-white shade in Papa&#x2019;s library filtered out into the corridor where I stood disoriented, unable to move. I watched as my pale hands turned golden.<br> <br>I opened my eyes and was in the same bedroom, surrounded by well-worn books and dolls I had never played with, nor ever would. I closed my eyes and sensed it wouldn&#x2019;t be long before we fled without a set destination on a huge ocean liner from a port in this country where we had never belonged.<br> <br>In the end, I didn&#x2019;t kill my parents. I didn&#x2019;t have to. Papa and Mama were the guilty ones. They forced me to throw myself into the abyss alongside them.<br> <br><br> <br>The apartment&#x2019;s smell had become intolerable. I didn&#x2019;t understand how Mama could live between those walls lined with moss-green silk that swallowed what little daylight there was at that time of year. It was the smell of enclosure.<br> <br>We had less time to live. I knew it; I felt it. We wouldn&#x2019;t be spending the summer there in Berlin. Mama had put mothballs in the closets to preserve her world, and the pungent odor filled the apartment. I had no idea what she was trying to protect, since we were going to lose everything regardless.<br> <br>&#x201c;You smell like the old ladies on Grosse Hamburger Strasse,&#x201d; Leo taunted me. Leo was my only friend; the one person who dared look me in the face without wanting to spit on me.<br> <br>Spring in Berlin was cold and rainy, but Papa often left without taking his coat. Whenever he went out in those days, he wouldn&#x2019;t wait for the elevator but took the stairs, which creaked as he trod on them. I wasn&#x2019;t allowed to use the stairs, though. He didn&#x2019;t walk down because he was in a hurry but because he didn&#x2019;t want to bump into anyone else from the building. The five families living on the floors beneath ours were all waiting for us to leave. Those who were once our friends were no longer friendly. Those who used to thank Papa or who tried to ingratiate themselves with Mama and her friends&#x2014;who praised her good taste or asked for advice on how to make a brightly colored handbag match their fashionable shoes&#x2014;now looked down their noses at us and could denounce us at any moment.<br> <br>Mama spent yet another day without going out. Every morning when she got up, she would fasten her ruby earrings and smooth back her beautiful, thick hair&#x2014;which was the envy of her friends whenever she appeared in the tearoom of the Hotel Adlon. Papa called her the Goddess, because she was so fascinated by the cinema, which was her only contact with the outside world. She would never miss the first night of any film starring the real screen goddess, &#x201c;La Divine&#x201d; Greta Garbo, at the Palast.<br> <br>&#x201c;She&#x2019;s more German than anyone,&#x201d; she would insist whenever she mentioned the divine Garbo, who was, in fact, Swedish. But back then motion pictures were silent, and no one cared where the star had been born.<br> <br>We discovered her. We always knew she would be worshipped. We appreciated her before anybody else; that&#x2019;s why Hollywood noticed her. And in her first talkie she said in perfect German: &#x201c;Whisky&#x2014;aber nicht zu knapp!&#x201d;<br> <br>Sometimes when they came back from the cinema, Mama was still in tears. &#x201c;I love sad endings&#x2014;in movies,&#x201d; she explained. &#x201c;Comedies weren&#x2019;t meant for me.&#x201d;<br> <br>She would swoon in Papa&#x2019;s arms, raise a hand to her brow, the other holding up the silk train of a cascading dress, toss back her head, and start talking in French.<br> <br>&#x201c;Armand, Armand . . .&#x201d; she would repeat languidly and with a strong accent, like La Divine herself.<br> <br>And Papa would call her &#x201c;my Camille.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Espï¿½re, mon ami, et sois bien certain d&#x2019;une chose, c&#x2019;est que, quoi qu&#x2019;il arrive, ta Marguerite te restera,&#x201d; she would reply, laughing hysterically. &#x201c;Dumas sounds ghastly in German, doesn&#x2019;t he?&#x201d;<br> <br>But Mama no longer went anywhere.<br> <br>&#x201c;Too many smashed windows&#x201d; had been her excuse ever since the previous November&#x2019;s terrible pogrom, when Papa had lost his job. He had been arrested at his university office and taken to the station on Grolmanstrasse, kept incommunicado for an offense we never understood. He shared a windowless cell with Leo&#x2019;s father, Herr Martin. After they were released, the two would get together daily&#x2014;and that worried Mama even more, as if they were planning an escape she was not prepared for yet. Fear was what prevented her from leaving her fortress. She lived in a state of constant agitation. Before, she used to go to the elegant salon at the Hotel Kaiserhof, just a few blocks away, but eventually it was full of the people who hated us: the ones who thought they were pure, whom Leo called Ogres.<br> <br>In the past, she would boast about Berlin. If she went on a shopping spree to Paris, she always stayed at the Ritz; and if she accompanied Papa to a lecture or concert in Vienna, at the Imperial:<br> <br>&#x201c;But we have the Adlon, our Grand Hotel on the Unter den Linden. La Divine stayed there, and immortalized it on screen.&#x201d;<br> <br>During those days, she would peer out the window, trying to find a reason for what was happening. What had become of her happy years? What had she been sentenced to, and why? She felt she was paying for the offenses of others: her parents, grandparents&#x2014;every one of her ancestors throughout the centuries.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m German, Hannah. I am a Strauss. Alma Strauss. Isn&#x2019;t that enough, Hannah?&#x201d; she said to me in German, and then in Spanish, and in English, and finally in French. As if someone were listening to her; as if to make her message entirely clear in each of the four languages she spoke fluently.<br> <br>I had agreed to meet Leo that day to go take photographs. We would see each other every afternoon at Frau Falkenhorst&#x2019;s cafï¿½ near Hackescher Markt. Whenever she spotted us, the owner would smile and call us &#x201c;bandits.&#x201d; We liked that. If either of us was later than expected, the first to arrive had to order a hot chocolate. Sometimes we&#x2019;d arrange to meet at the cafï¿½ near the Alexanderplatz Station exit, which had shelves filled with sweets wrapped in silver paper. When he needed to see me urgently, Leo would wait for me at the newspaper kiosk near my home, allowing us to avoid running into any of our neighbors, who, despite also being our tenants, always shunned us.<br> <br>In order not to disobey the adults, I bypassed the carpeted stairs, which were increasingly dusty, and took the elevator. It stopped at the third floor.<br> <br>&#x201c;Hello, Frau Hofmeister,&#x201d; I said, smiling at her daughter, Gretel, who used to be my playmate. Gretel was sad, because not long before, she had lost her beautiful white puppy. I felt so sorry for her.<br> <br>We were the same age, but I was much taller. She looked down, and Frau Hofmeister had the nerve to say to her, &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s take the stairs. When are they going to leave? They&#x2019;re putting us all in such a difficult situation . . .&#x201d;<br> <br>As if I wasn&#x2019;t listening, as if it was only my shadow standing inside the elevator. As if I didn&#x2019;t exist. That&#x2019;s what she wanted: for me not to exist.<br> <br>The Ditmars, Hartmanns, Brauers, and Schultzes lived in our building. We rented them their apartments. The building had belonged to Mama&#x2019;s family since before she was born. They were the ones who should leave. They were not from here. We were. We were more German than they were.<br> <br>The elevator door closed, it started to go down, and I could still see Gretel&#x2019;s feet.<br> <br>&#x201c;Dirty people,&#x201d; I heard.<br> <br>Had I heard it right? What have we done for me to have to endure that? What crime had we committed? I was not dirty. I didn&#x2019;t want people to think of me as dirty. I came out of the elevator and hid under the stairs so I wouldn&#x2019;t meet them again. I saw them leave the building. Gretel&#x2019;s head was still bowed. She glanced backward, looking for me, perhaps wanting to apologize, but her mother pushed her on.<br> <br>&#x201c;What are you staring at?&#x201d; she shouted.<br> <br>I ran back up the stairs noisily, in tears. Yes, crying with rage and impotence because I could not tell Frau Hofmeister that she was dirtier than I was. If we bothered her, she could leave the building; it was our building. I wanted to hit the walls, smash the valuable camera my father had given me. I entered our apartment, and Mama could not understand why I was so furious.<br> <br>&#x201c;Hannah! Hannah!&#x201d; she called out to me, but I chose to ignore her.<br> <br>I went into the cold bathroom, slammed the door, and turned on the shower. I was still crying; or rather, I wanted to stop crying but found it impossible. Fully clothed and wearing my shoes, I climbed into the perfectly white bathtub. Mama kept on calling to me and then finally left me in peace. All I could hear was the sound of the scalding water cascading onto me. I let it flow into my eyes until they burned; into my ears, my nose, my mouth.<br> <br>I started to take off my clothes and shoes, which were heavier because of the water and my dirtiness. I soaped myself, smeared on Mama&#x2019;s bath salts that irritated my skin, and rubbed myself with a white towel to get rid of every last trace of impurity. My skin was red, as red as if it was going to peel. I turned the water even hotter, until I couldn&#x2019;t take it anymore. When I came out of the shower, I collapsed on the cold black-and-white tiles.<br> <br>Fortunately, I had run out of tears. I dried myself, scrubbing hard at this skin I didn&#x2019;t want and which, God willing, would start to slough off after all the heat I&#x2019;d subjected it to. I examined every pore in front of the steamed-up mirror: face, hands, feet, ears&#x2014;everything&#x2014;to see if there was any trace of impurity left. I wanted to know who was the dirty one now.<br> <br>I cowered in a corner, trembling, shrinking, feeling like a slab of meat and bone. This was my only hiding place. In the end, I knew that however much I washed, burned my skin, cut my hair, gouged out my eyes, turned deaf, however much I dressed or talked differently, or took on a different name, they would always see me as impure.<br> <br>It might not have been a bad idea to knock at the distinguished Frau Hofmeister&#x2019;s door to ask her to check that I didn&#x2019;t have any tiny stain on my skin, that she didn&#x2019;t have to keep Gretel away from me, that I wasn&#x2019;t a bad influence on her child, who was as blond, perfect, and immaculate as me.<br> <br>I went to my room and dressed all in white and pink, the purest colors I could find in my wardrobe. I went looking for Mama and hugged her, because I knew she understood me; even though she chose to stay at home and so didn&#x2019;t have to face anyone. She had built a fortress in her room, which in turn was protected by the apartment&#x2019;s thick columns, in a building made up of enormous stone blocks and double windows.<br> <br>I had to be quick. Leo must have already been at the station, darting all over the place, trying to stay out of the way of people running to catch their trains.<br> <br>At least I knew that he thought of me as being clean.</p><h2>Curriculum Development for Medical Education: A Six-Step Approach</h2><p><p>Based on a proven six-step model and including examples and questions to guide application of those timeless principles, <i>Curriculum Development for Medical Education</i> is a practical guidebook for all faculty members and administrators responsible for the educational experiences of medical students, residents, fellows, and clinical practitioners.</p><p>Incorporating revisions driven by calls for reform and innovations in medical education that challenge established teaching models, the third edition includes an awareness of new accreditation standards and regulatory guidelines.

Think of a Michael Crichton novel but on steroids and with a zippy joie de vivre. (I like to imagine Rollins sitting behind his keyboard and thinking, "But what if I added <em>this</em> crazy thing..." And then doing it, no matter how over-the-top the action will get.) Director Painter Crowe, operative Gray Pierce, former assassin Seichan, and the other members of Sigma Force (a secret group under DARPA) have tackled many strange things in the past, but the biblical plagues of Exodus is a new challenge for them&#x2014;and one that now threatens the entire world through an unstoppable virus. Contagion theory, Nikola Tesla, living mummification, and more all coalesce into a globe-spanning race to save humanity before an ancient disease wipes out everyone through genetic modification. Those who have read Sigma novels before will enjoy this latest installment in which Rollins put his team through their paces in the desert, the jungle, and the northern icy wastelands of Canada as they track down clues left thousands of years ago on how to stop the oncoming plague. Those who are new to Sigma will catch up easily as they strap themselves in for a twisty, plunging thrill ride. <em>--Adrian Liang, The Amazon Book Review</em><b>About James Rollins</b><br><br>JAMES ROLLINS is a #1 New York Times bestselling author of international thrillers that have been translated into more than forty languages. Known for unveiling unseen worlds, scientific breakthroughs, and historical secrets, Rollins' knack for breakneck pacing and stunning originality has been hailed by critics and embraced by scores of millions of readers around the world.<br><br><b>The Critics Rave</b><br><br>The New York Times says that his "roguish charm comes from his efforts to persuade readers the story is credible [through] real-life sources for his novel's science, history and geography." Rollins' rare blend of action, suspense, and knowledge was also mentioned by the Huffington Post, which stated that "After Crichton passed away in 2008 he clearly passed the baton to James Rollins, who like Crichton, is a renaissance man."<br><br>NPR calls his work "adventurous and enormously engrossing..." and the New York Journal of Books had this to say: "If you're a fan of smart, entertaining adventure fiction, this is your summer beach read writ large....All the science, all the history, and all the locations are masterfully intertwined. The characters are multi-dimensional. And the story is, well, a corker."<br><br><b>The Story Teller's Story</b><br><br>As a boy immersed in the scientific adventures of Doc Savage, the wonders of Jules Verne and H.G. Wells, and pulps such as The Shadow, The Spider, and The Avenger, James Rollins decided he wanted to be a writer. He honed his storytelling skills early, spinning elaborate tales that were often at the heart of pranks played on his brothers and sisters.<br><br>Before he would set heroes and villains on harrowing adventures, Rollins embarked on a career in veterinary medicine, graduating from the University of Missouri and establishing a successful veterinary practice. This hands-on knowledge of medicine and science helps shape the research and scientific speculation that set James Rollins books apart.<br><br><b>Explosive Page-Turning Adventures</b><br><br>The exotic locales of James Rollins novels have emerged as a hybrid between imagination, research, and his extensive travels throughout the United States and Europe, as well as New Zealand, the South Pacific, China, Southeast Asia, Africa, Australia, and South America.

In the predawn light his features were unclear. He was simply a presence of darker blue than the sky behind him. But there was about him a scent of woody smoke and new leaves and the honey of far-off, unseen flowers. The presence pointed at Tendai and said, "You!"</p><p>The boy woke up at once. The first rays of dawn were sliding over the garden wall, and the window was empty. What a strange dream, thought Tendai. He pulled the sheet over his head as he tried to remember it better. The image faded away, leaving a strange sense that something important was about to happen. His ancestors must have felt this way before a big hunt.</p><p>Tendai imagined them lying on the warm earth of their huts, feeling it tremble with destiny. Their shields and spears lay ready by the door. Not like me, he thought. He snuggled into a soft bed in one of the finest mansions in Zimbabwe. Around the house were a large garden and a wall studded with searchlights and alarms. The automatic Doberman growled as it made a last tour of the lawn before retiring to its kennel.</p><p>Any tremble of destiny would have had to struggle through the concrete foundations of the house. It would have had to work through inlaid wooden floors and thick carpets, to creep up the grand staircase to the second floor. Only a whisper could have found its way to his waiting ear.</p><p>Yet find him it did.</p><p>He heard the robot gardeners clipping the grass along a walk. Hoopoes called from jacaranda trees, but a microchip went on with a far better selection of birdsong. It was certainly beautiful, but Tendai felt a pang of regret at not being able to hear the real birds. The mynah &#x2013; a living creature smuggled in by the Mellower &#x2013; stirred in its cage. "Mangwanani," it said. "Have you slept well?"</p><p>Kuda, Tendai's little brother, sat up and answered, "I have done so if you have done so."</p><p>The mynah paid no attention to this polite reply. "Mangawani! Mangawani!" it shrieked, rattling the door of its cage.</p><p>Kuda hopped out of bed and released the bird. It fluttered to a table and snapped up a crust of bread from last night's supper. Tendai could hear the crumbs showering over his books. He pulled the covers more tightly around his ears to keep in the light, happy feeling of excitement.</p><p>A house robor purred as it went from door to door with tea. It entered and placed two steaming cups on the table. The mynah squawked as it was pushed aside. "Good morning," said the robot. "It's September second, 2194. The time is six-fifteen A.M. Breakfast is at seven. Be on time if you know what's good for you."</p><p>"Go away," muttered Kuda as he blew on the hot tea.</p><p>"Anyone who oversleeps is a big fat booboo head," retorted the robot as it glided out.</p><p>"Rita programmed it to say that," Tendai said as he threw back the covers.</p><p>"I know. Well, are you going to ask him?" Kuda swung his short legs off the edge of his chair.</p><p>"I'm not promising anything."</p><p>"You're a wimp."</p><p>Tendai didn't bother to argue. Kuda didn't know how difficult it was to ask Father anything. That duty fell on the eldest brother. Besides, when Kuda got an idea in his head, it took an earthquake to dislodge it. "I had the funniest dream this morning," Tendai began.</p><p>"The mynah just knocked over your tea," Kuda remarked. Tendai grabbed a towel and cleaned up the mess. Then he quickly took a shower and dressed in his Scout uniform. Breakfast was at seven, not a minute earlier or later.</p><p>The two brothers stood outside the dining room door, where they were joined by Rita. She was also in a Scout uniform. A hundred years before, Boy and Girl Scouts had belonged to different organizations, but now they were lumped together. Father approved of them because they taught the virtues most revered by the people of Zimbabwe: loyalty, bravery, courteousness and reverence for Mwari, the supreme god.</p><p>Kuda had no Scout uniform because he was only four. He did his best with a sand-colored shirt and a pair of shorts. "Breakfast!" chimed the door as it swung open. The children trooped in. They lined up in order with Tendai, age thirteen, first and Rita, eleven, second. Tendai was secretly embarrassed that he and Rita were the same height. Kuda was last.</p><p>Mother smiled at them from her chair. She looked cool and elegant in her long white dress. She toyed with a slice of cantaloupe on a blue plate.</p><p>"All present and accounted for," said Father. "Rita, stop slouching." The children stood as tall as they could manage as their father marched from his great chair at the head of the table. He wore a general's uniform with gold braid on his massive shoulders. His chest was covered with medals. Since it was breakfast and he was home and it was a warm day, he left his cap on a hat rack.</p><p>"Shirttail out, Kuda. Five push-ups for you. Rita, pull in your stomach. You are not a watermelon. Tendai-" Father stopped, and Tendai felt sweat prickle on his forehead. He loved his father, but sometimes he wished he wasn't so &#x2013; so military. He suspected Father would like to have Mother at the end of the line, tall and perfectly groomed. But even Father could hardly order her to do push-ups if he detected a loose thread.</p><p>"Tendai passes inspection," said Father, and he stalked back to his chair. Tendai relaxed, not letting it show. Passing inspection was as close as Father ever got to praise. Perhaps he could ask the question after all.</p><p>They were allowed to sit down, but things began to go wrong at once. The maid robot spooned porrideg on the tablecloth. She had to be sent to the kitchen for readjustment. The butler took over the serving. He wouldn't give Rita extra sugar, and she sulked. The holophone trotted up to Father's chair and clamored until he answered it.</p><p>A report began to feed in: pictures of fire engines and ambulances flashed across the screen. Tendai watched idly because he had nothing better to do. The Masks, the only ganag remaining after Father's war on crime, had set off a bomb in a shopping center. Bodies were taken out of the smoking ruins. Statistics rattled across the bottom of the screen. Tendai turned away. It was all remote, of no interest.</p><p>"Accursed Masks!" shouted Father at the holophone. "Get me the police chief!" The phone bobbed and dialed. Father and the police chief made plans while the omelets on everyone's plates got cold.</p><p>Of course no one thought of eating until Father was ready. He was an elder and head of the family.</p><p>"Lizard eggs," muttered Rita, poking at her omelet.</p><p>"Don&#x2019;t start," Tendai said in a low voice.</p><p>"Chickens are descended from reptiles. I read it in a book."</p><p>"Be quiet."</p><p>"Nasty old cold lizard eggs."</p><p>"Is something wrong?" thundered Father from the head of the table.</p><p>"No," said Tendai, Rita and Kuda all together.</p><p>"Everything's delicious," added Rita. "Especially the eggs."</p><p>"Is it too much to ask," shouted Father, "when I'm trying to protect ten million citizens from packs of hyenas that want to tear down our civilization, <i>is it too much to ask for a little peace and quiet at the breakfast table</i>&gt;" He slammed the receiver down. The holophone whimpered and cowered against a wall.</p><p>Everyone ate in silence. Tendai had a mental picture of his father lining up everyone in the city. "Ten push-ups for you, twenty for you," he would growl as he inspected a line of ten million people. Tendai had to clench his jaws to keep from laughing.</p><p>"What's this?" said Father as the butler robot placed a rack of dry toast by his plate.</p><p>"No butter until your blood pressure goes down. Doctor's orders," the butler said.</p><p>"I hate dry toast." But Father piled it with blackberry jam and ate it anyway.</p><p>Tendai listened to the birdsong in the garden. He couldn't ask about the Scout trip now. They were going to spend another long, boring day locked up in the house. All because Father was afraid they would get kidnapped.</p><p>"It's time for the Mellower," said Mother in her gentle voice. Everyone looked up, even Father, although he pretended he was only checking the time. The butler robot cleared away the dishes. They sat expectantly, watching the door.</p><p>"He's late," said Mother.</p><p>"He's always late," said Father.</p><p>Tendai felt a disloyal twinge of pleasure. The Mellower was the one person Father couldn't organize. The Mellower had smudges on his shoes. Buttons dropped off his shirt and were forgotten. His lunches lasted three hours, and he made paper airplanes of the homework he was supposed to supervise. Tendai, Rita and Kuda often covered up for him.</p><p>"I'll send the butler after him," sighed Mother.</p><p>"If he were one of my soldiers, I'd order him to do fifty push-ups," Father said.

With unbridled honesty and humor, Sacks writes about the passions that have driven his life&#x2014;from motorcycles and weight lifting to neurology and poetry. He writes about his love affairs, both romantic and intellectual; his guilt over leaving his family to come to America; his bond with his schizophrenic brother; and the writers and scientists&#x2014;W.

Edelman, Francis Crick&#x2014;who have influenced his work. <i>On the Move</i> is the story of a brilliantly unconventional physician and writer, a man who has illuminated the many ways that the brain makes us human. &nbsp;</p></p><p><p><strong> An Amazon Best Book of May 2015:</strong> Oliver Sacks&#x2019; <em>On the Move</em> is a disarming book. His honesty, energy, and clear restlessness illuminate each page, drawing the reader in to a life of great achievement in spite of some hurdles. The highest of those hurdles may have been his difficulty with romantic love. The origin of that difficulty can be traced to his mother&#x2019;s severe reaction upon learning that he was gay: she called him &#x201c;an abomination.&#x201d; Sacks forgave his mother for that, even if he couldn&#x2019;t shake her words. His solution appears to have been just to move on and keep moving&#x2014;and the entire book is imbued with a sense of movement. This can be seen in his love of motorcycles and weight lifting, in his desire to travel, in his move from England to the United States, and even when he writes of his former addiction to amphetamines. Of course his mind was moving at all times as well, and in this book Sacks continues to write convincingly about the ways our minds make us human. Despite claiming shyness, Sacks amassed an impressive list of friends and acquaintances&#x2014;from the poets Thom Gunn, Richard Selig, and W.H. Auden, to Francis Crick and Stephen Jay Gould, to Robert De Niro and Robin Williams. And there was always the writing. &#x201c;I am a storyteller, for better and for worse,&#x201d; he writes at the end of the book. When I read that line, I realized that I felt like he was sitting in the same room with me. <em>-- Chris Schluep</em></p><p>Oliver Sacks was a physician, writer, and professor of neurology. Born in London in 1933, he moved to New York City in 1965, where he launched his medical career and began writing case studies of his patients. Called the &#x201c;poet laureate of medicine&#x201d; by <i>The New York Times</i>, Sacks is the author of more than a dozen books, including <i>The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat,</i>&nbsp;<i>Musicophilia</i>, and&nbsp;<i>Awakenings</i>, which inspired an Oscar-nominated film and a play by Harold Pinter.&nbsp;He was the recipient of many awards and honorary degrees, and was made a Commander of the British Empire in 2008 for services to medicine.

Exploring prayer as a conscious, dynamic relationship with God, Barry discusses contemplative approaches to nature and Scripture, emotional self-awareness, and ways of transcending ambivalence or outmoded images of God.

Edited by Ron Hansen, this collection shows that just like at the movies, the books of the 1940s and 1950s represent a high point for the Western. In the Pulitzer Prize-winning <i>The Ox-Bow Incident</i>, a postwar meditation on authoritarianism, Walter van Tilburg Clark explores the thin line between civilization and barbarism through the story of a lynch mob that targets three innocent men. Set in Wyoming in 1889, a time when ranchers and cattle companies waged war with each other, Jack Schaefer's <i>Shane</i> is built upon the timeless premise of the arrival of a mysterious stranger, filtered through a boy's perceptions. Alan Le May's <i>The Searchers</i>, the basis for John Ford's cinematic masterpiece starring John Wayne, follows the dogged quest of two men to rescue a young girl taken prisoner by Comanche warriors. And Oakley Hall's <i>Warlock</i>, a novel that anticipates the later books of Cormac McCarthy and Larry McMurtry, casts the battle for control of a southwestern outpost as a bloody saga pitting a marauding gang of cowboys and rustlers against the town's defenders, led by the legendary gunslinger Clay Blaisedell. All four novels were memorably adapted for the screen, and their gripping stories--told with brisk narrative energy, psychological depth, and laconic humor--have contributed unforgettably to the Western's enduring legacy in American culture.</p><p>Ron Hansen, editor, is the author of three story collections and ten novels, including most recently <i>The Kid</i>, as well as <i>The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford</i>, which was made into an Oscar-nominated film. His novel <i>Atticus</i> was a finalist for the National Book Award. He teaches at Santa Clara University.</p><h2>Back Pocket Pasta: Inspired Dinners to Cook on the Fly: A Cookbook</h2><p><b>Here are<i> </i>more than 75 sophisticated, weeknight-friendly pasta dishes that come together in the same amount of time it takes to boil the water.&nbsp; <br></b><br> As much a mindset as it is a cookbook, <i>Back Pocket Pasta</i> shows how a well-stocked kitchen and a few seasonal ingredients can be the driving force behind delicious, simply prepared meals.

His first three novels&#x2015; <em>Horseman</em>, <em>Pass By</em> (1961),* <em>Leaving Cheyenne</em> (1963), and <em>The Last Picture Show</em> (1966)&#x2015; all set in the north Texas town of Thalia after World War II, are collected here for the first time. In this trilogy, McMurtry writes tragically of men and women trying to carve out an existence on the plains, where the forces of modernity challenge small- town American life. From a cattleranch rivalry that confirms McMurtry&#x2019;s &#x201c;full- blooded Western genius&#x201d; (<em>Publishers Weekly</em>) to a love triangle involving a cowboy, his rancher boss and wife, and finally to the hardscrabble citizens of an oil- patch town trying to keep their only movie house alive, McMurtry captures the stark realities of the West like no one else.

She stood at the window of her pink-frilled sitting room in the palace at Boktor watching her son Kheva and Unrak, the son of Barak of Trellheim, at play in a garden drenched with morning sunlight. The boys had reached that age where sometimes it seemed almost possible to see them growing, and their voices wavered uncertainly between boyish soprano and manly baritone. Porenn sighed, smoothing the front of her black gown. The Queen of Drasnia had worn black since the death of her husband. &#x201c;You would be proud of him, my dear Rhodar,&#x201d; she whispered sadly.<br><br> There was a light knock at her door.<br><br> &#x201c;Yes?&#x201d; she replied, not turning.<br><br> &#x201c;There&#x2019;s a Nadrak here to see you, your Majesty,&#x201d; the aged butler at the door reported. &#x201c;He says you know him.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Oh?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;He says his name is Yarblek.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Oh, yes. Prince Kheldar&#x2019;s associate. Show him in, please.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;There&#x2019;s a woman with him, your Majesty,&#x201d; the butler said with a disapproving expression. &#x201c;She uses language your Majesty might prefer not to hear.&#x201d;<br><br> Porenn smiled warmly. &#x201c;That must be Vella,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve heard her swear before. I don&#x2019;t know that she&#x2019;s really all that serious about it. Show them both in, if you would, please.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;At once, your Majesty.&#x201d;<br><br> Yarblek was as shabby as ever. At some point, the shoulder seam of his long black overcoat had given way and had been rudimentarily repaired with a piece of rawhide thong. His beard was coarse and black and scraggly, his hair was unkempt, and he looked as if he didn&#x2019;t smell very good. &#x201c;Your Majesty,&#x201d; he said grandly, attempting a bow which was marred a bit by an unsteady lurch.<br><br> &#x201c;Drunk already, Master Yarblek?&#x201d; Porenn asked him archly.<br><br> &#x201c;No, not really, Porenn,&#x201d; he replied, unabashed. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s just a little carry-over from last night.&#x201d;<br><br> The queen was not offended by the Nadrak&#x2019;s use of her first name. Yarblek&#x2019;s grip on formality had never been very firm.<br><br> The woman who had entered with him was a stunningly beautiful Nadrak with blue-black hair and smoldering eyes. She was dressed in tight-fitting leather trousers and a black leather vest. A silver-hilted dagger protruded from each of her boot tops, and two more were tucked under the wide leather belt about her waist. She bowed with infinite grace. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re looking tired, Porenn,&#x201d; she observed. &#x201c;I think you need more sleep.&#x201d;<br><br> Porenn laughed. &#x201c;Tell that to the people who bring me stacks of parchment every hour or so.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;I made myself a rule years ago,&#x201d; Yarblek said, sprawling uninvited in a chair. &#x201c;Never put anything down in writing. It saves time as well as keeping me out of trouble.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;It seems to me that I&#x2019;ve heard Kheldar say the same thing.&#x201d;<br><br> Yarblek shrugged. &#x201c;Silk&#x2019;s got a good grip on reality.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;I haven&#x2019;t seen you two for quite some time,&#x201d; Porenn noted, also sitting.<br><br> &#x201c;We&#x2019;ve been in Mallorea,&#x201d; Vella told her, wandering around the room and looking appraisingly at the furnishings.<br><br> &#x201c;Isn&#x2019;t that dangerous? I&#x2019;ve heard that there&#x2019;s plague there.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;It&#x2019;s pretty much confined to Mal Zeth,&#x201d; Yarblek replied. &#x201c;Polgara persuaded the Emperor to seal up the city.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Polgara?&#x201d; Porenn exclaimed, coming to her feet. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s she doing in Mallorea?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;She was going in the general direction of a place called Ashaba the last time I saw her. She had Belgarath and the others with her.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;How did they get to Mallorea?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;By boat, I&#x2019;d imagine. It&#x2019;s a long swim.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Yarblek, am I going to have to drag every single scrap of information out of you?&#x201d; Porenn demanded in exasperation.<br><br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;m getting to it, Porenn,&#x201d; he said, sounding a little injured. &#x201c;Do you want the story first or the messages? I&#x2019;ve got lots of messages for you, and Vella&#x2019;s got a couple more that she won&#x2019;t even talk about&#x2014;at least not to me.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Just start at the beginning, Yarblek.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Any way you want it.&#x201d; He scratched at his beard. &#x201c;The way I got the story is that Silk and Belgarath and the others were in Cthol Murgos. They got captured by the Malloreans, and &#x2019;Zakath took them all to Mal Zeth. The young fellow with the big sword&#x2014;Belgarion, isn&#x2019;t it? Anyway, he and &#x2019;Zakath got to be friends&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Garion and &#x2019;Zakath?&#x201d; Porenn asked incredulously. &#x201c;How?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;I wouldn&#x2019;t know. I wasn&#x2019;t there when it happened. To make it short, they were friends, but then the plague broke out in Mal Zeth. I managed to sneak Silk and the others out of the city, and we went north. We separated before we got to Venna. They wanted to go to this Ashaba place, and I had a caravan load of goods I wanted to get to Yar Marak. Made a fairly good profit, actually.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Why were they going to Ashaba?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;They were after some woman named Zandramas&#x2014;the one who abducted Belgarion&#x2019;s son.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;A woman? Zandramas is a woman?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;So they told me. Belgarath gave me a letter for you. It&#x2019;s all in there. I told him that he shouldn&#x2019;t write it down, but he wouldn&#x2019;t listen to me.&#x201d; Yarblek unwound himself from his chair, fished around inside his overcoat, and handed a rumpled and none-too-clean piece of parchment to the queen. Then he strolled to the window and looked out. &#x201c;Isn&#x2019;t that Trellheim&#x2019;s boy down there?&#x201d; he asked. &#x201c;The husky one with the red hair?&#x201d;<br><br> Porenn was reading the parchment. &#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; she said absently, trying to concentrate on the message.<br><br> &#x201c;Is he here? Trellheim, I mean?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Yes. I don&#x2019;t know if he&#x2019;s awake yet, though. He stayed up rather late last night and he was a little tipsy when he went to bed.&#x201d;<br><br> Yarblek laughed. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s Barak, all right. Has he got his wife and daughters with him, too?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;No,&#x201d; Porenn said. &#x201c;They stayed in Val Alorn, making the preparations for his oldest daughter&#x2019;s wedding.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Is she that old already?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Chereks marry young. They seem to think it&#x2019;s the best way to keep a girl out of trouble. Barak and his son came here to get away from all the fuss.&#x201d;<br><br> Yarblek laughed again. &#x201c;I think I&#x2019;ll go wake him up and see if he&#x2019;s got anything to drink.&#x201d; He touched his forefinger to the spot between his eyes with a pained look. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m feeling a little delicate this morning, and Barak&#x2019;s a good man to get well with. I&#x2019;ll stop back when I&#x2019;m feeling better. Besides, you&#x2019;ve got your mail to read. Oh,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;I almost forgot. Here are some others.&#x201d; He started rummaging around inside his shabby coat. &#x201c;One from Polgara.&#x201d; He tossed it negligently on the table. &#x201c;One from Belgarion. One from Silk, and one from the blond girl with the dimples&#x2014;the one they call Velvet. The snake didn&#x2019;t send anything&#x2014;you know how snakes are. Now, if you&#x2019;ll excuse me, I&#x2019;m really not feeling too good.&#x201d; He lurched to the door and went out.<br><br> &#x201c;That is the most exasperating man in the world,&#x201d; Porenn declared.<br><br> &#x201c;He does it on purpose.&#x201d; Vella shrugged. &#x201c;He thinks it&#x2019;s funny.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Yarblek said that you have some messages for me, too,&#x201d; the queen said. &#x201c;I suppose I should read them all at once&#x2014;get all the shocks over with at one time.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve only got one, Porenn,&#x201d; Vella replied, &#x201c;and it isn&#x2019;t in writing. Liselle&#x2014;the one they call Velvet&#x2014;asked me to tell you something when we were alone.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;All right,&#x201d; Porenn said, putting down Belgarath&#x2019;s letter.<br><br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not sure how they found out about this,&#x201d; Vella said, &#x201c;but it seems that the King of Cthol Murgos is not the son of Taur Urgas.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;What are you saying, Vella?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Urgit isn&#x2019;t even related to that frothing lunatic. It seems that a number of years ago, a certain Drasnian businessman paid a visit to the palace in Rak Goska. He and Taur Urgas&#x2019; second wife became friendly.&#x201d; She smiled with one eyebrow slightly raised. &#x201c;Very friendly. I&#x2019;ve always had that suspicion about Murgo women. Anyway, Urgit was the result of that friendship.&#x201d;<br><br> A terrible suspicion began to dawn on Queen Porenn.<br><br> Vella grinned impishly at her. &#x201c;We all knew that Silk had royal connections,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;We just didn&#x2019;t know how many royal families he was connected to.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;No!&#x201d; Porenn gasped.<br><br> Vella laughed. &#x201c;Oh, yes. Liselle confronted Urgit&#x2019;s mother with it, and the lady confessed.&#x201d; The Nadrak girl&#x2019;s face grew serious. &#x201c;The whole point of Liselle&#x2019;s message is that Silk doesn&#x2019;t want that bony fellow, Javelin, to find out about it. Liselle felt that she had to report it to somebody. That&#x2019;s why she told me to pass it on to you. I guess you&#x2019;re supposed to decide whether to tell Javelin or not.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;How very kind of her,&#x201d; Porenn said drily. &#x201c;Now they want me to keep secrets from the chief of my own intelligence service.&#x201d;<br><br> Vella&#x2019;s eyes twinkled. &#x201c;Liselle&#x2019;s in a kind of difficult situation, Porenn,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;I know that I drink too much and I swear a lot. That makes people think that I&#x2019;m stupid, but I&#x2019;m not. Nadrak women know the world, and I have very good eyes. I didn&#x2019;t actually catch them at it, but I&#x2019;d be willing to wager half the money I&#x2019;ll get when Yarblek sells me that Silk and Liselle are keeping company.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Vella!&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;I couldn&#x2019;t prove it, Porenn, but I know what I saw.&#x201d; The Nadrak girl sniffed at her leather vest and made a sour face. &#x201c;If it&#x2019;s not too much trouble, I would really like to take a bath. I&#x2019;ve been in the saddle for weeks. Horses are nice enough animals, I suppose, but I really don&#x2019;t want to smell like one.&#x201d;<br><br> Porenn&#x2019;s mind was working very fast now; to give herself time to think, she rose and approached the wild Nadrak girl. &#x201c;Have you ever worn satin, Vella?&#x201d; she asked. &#x201c;A gown, perhaps?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Satin? Me?&#x201d; Vella laughed coarsely. &#x201c;Nadraks never wear satin.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Then you might be the very first.&#x201d; Queen Porenn reached out her small white hands and lifted Vella&#x2019;s wealth of blue-black hair into a tumbled mass atop her head. &#x201c;I&#x2019;d give my soul for hair like that,&#x201d; she murmured.<br><br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll trade you,&#x201d; Vella offered. &#x201c;Do you know what price I could bring if I were blond?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Hush, Vella,&#x201d; Porenn said absently. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m trying to think.&#x201d; She twined the girl&#x2019;s hair loosely about her hands, startled at how alive it felt. Then she reached out, lifted Vella&#x2019;s chin, and looked into her huge eyes. Something seemed to reach out and touch the Queen of Drasnia, and she suddenly knew the destiny of this half-wild child before her. &#x201c;Oh, my dear,&#x201d; she almost laughed, &#x201c;what an amazing future you have in store for you. You&#x2019;ll touch the sky, Vella, the very sky.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;I really don&#x2019;t know what you&#x2019;re talking about, Porenn.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;You will.&#x201d; Porenn looked at the perfect face before her. &#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; she said, &#x201c;satin, I think. Lavender would be nice.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;I prefer red.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;No, dear,&#x201d; Porenn told her. &#x201c;Red just wouldn&#x2019;t do. It definitely has to be lavender.&#x201d; She reached out and touched the girl&#x2019;s ears. &#x201c;And I think amethyst here and here.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;What are you up to?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;It&#x2019;s a game, child. Drasnians are very good at games. And when I&#x2019;m done, I&#x2019;ll double your price.&#x201d; Porenn was just a bit smug about it. &#x201c;Bathe first, then let&#x2019;s see what we can do with you.&#x201d;<br><br> Vella shrugged. &#x201c;As long as I can keep my daggers.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;We&#x2019;ll work that out.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Can you really do something with a lump like me?&#x201d; Vella asked, almost plaintively.<br><br> &#x201c;Trust me,&#x201d; Porenn said, smiling. &#x201c;Now go bathe, child. I have letters to read and decisions to make.&#x201d;<br><br> After the Queen of Drasnia had read the letters, she summoned her butler and issued a couple of orders. &#x201c;I want to speak with the Earl of Trellheim,&#x201d; she said, &#x201c;before he gets any drunker. I also need to talk with Javelin just as soon as he can get to the palace.&#x201d;<br><br> It was perhaps ten minutes later when Barak appeared in her doorway. He was a bit bleary-eyed, and his vast red beard stuck out in all directions. Yarblek came with him.<br><br> &#x201c;Put away your tankards, gentlemen,&#x201d; Porenn said crisply. &#x201c;There&#x2019;s work to be done. Barak, is the Seabird ready to sail?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;She&#x2019;s always ready,&#x201d; he said in an injured tone.<br><br> &#x201c;Good. Then round up your sailors. You have a number of places to go. I&#x2019;m calling a meeting of the Alorn Council. Get word to Anheg, Fulrach, and Brand&#x2019;s son Kail at Riva. Stop off in Arendia and pick up Mandorallen and Lelldorin.&#x201d; She pursed her lips. &#x201c;Korodullin&#x2019;s not well enough to travel, so bypass Vo Mimbre. He&#x2019;d get out of his deathbed to attend if he knew what was going on. Go to Tol Honeth instead and get Varana. I&#x2019;ll send word to Cho-Hag and Hettar myself. Yarblek, you go to Yar Nadrak and get Drosta. Leave Vella here with me.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;But&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;No buts, Yarblek. Do exactly as I say.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;I thought you said this was a meeting of the Alorn Council, Porenn,&#x201d; Barak objected. &#x201c;Why are we inviting the Arends and the Tolnedrans&#x2014;and the Nadraks?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;We&#x2019;ve got an emergency on our hands, Barak, and it concerns everybody.&#x201d;<br><br> They stood staring stupidly at her.<br><br> She clapped her hands together sharply. &#x201c;Quickly, gentlemen, quickly. We don&#x2019;t have any time to waste.&#x201d;<br> Urgit, High King of Cthol Murgos, sat on his garish throne in the Drojim Palace in Rak Urga. He was dressed in his favorite purple doublet and hose, he had one leg negligently cocked over the arm of the throne, and he was absently tossing his crown back and forth between his hands as he listened to the droning voice of Agachak, the cadaverous-looking Hierarch of Rak Urga. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s going to have to wait, Agachak,&#x201d; he said finally. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m getting married next month.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;This is a command of the Church, Urgit.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Wonderful. Give the Church my regards.&#x201d;<br><br> Agachak looked taken a bit aback. &#x201c;You don&#x2019;t believe in anything now, do you, my King?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Not very much, no. Is this sick world we live in ready for atheism yet?&#x201d;<br><br> For the first time in his life, Urgit saw doubt on the face of the Hierarch. &#x201c;Atheism&#x2019;s a clean place, Agachak,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;a flat, gray, empty place where man makes his own destiny, and let the Gods go hang. I didn&#x2019;t make them; they didn&#x2019;t make me; and we&#x2019;re quits on all of that. I wish them well, though.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;This is unlike you, Urgit,&#x201d; Agachak said.<br><br> &#x201c;No, not really. I&#x2019;m just tired of playing the clown.&#x201d; He stretched out his leg and tossed his crown at his foot like a hoop. He caught it and kicked it back again. &#x201c;You don&#x2019;t really understand, do you, Agachak?&#x201d; he said as he caught the crown out of midair.<br><br> The Hierarch of Rak Urga drew himself up. &#x201c;This is not a request, Urgit. I&#x2019;m not asking you.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Good. Because I&#x2019;m not going.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;I command you to go.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think so.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Do you realize to whom you&#x2019;re talking?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Perfectly, old boy. You&#x2019;re the same tiresome old Grolim who&#x2019;s been boring me to tears ever since I inherited the throne from that fellow who used to chew on the carpets back in Rak Goska. Listen carefully, Agachak. I&#x2019;ll use short words and simple sentences so that I don&#x2019;t confuse you. I am not going to Mallorea. I&#x2019;ve never had any intention of going to Mallorea. There&#x2019;s nothing I want to see in Mallorea. There&#x2019;s nothing I want to do there. I most definitely do not intend to put myself anywhere near Kal Zakath, and he&#x2019;s gone back to Mal Zeth. Not only that, they have demons in Mallorea. Have you ever seen a demon, Agachak?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Once or twice,&#x201d; the Hierarch replied sullenly.<br><br> &#x201c;And you&#x2019;re still going to Mallorea? Agachak, you&#x2019;re as crazy as Taur Urgas was.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;I can make you king of all of Angarak.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t want to be king of all of Angarak. I don&#x2019;t even want to be King of Cthol Murgos. All I want is to be left alone to contemplate the horror that&#x2019;s about to descend on me.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Your marriage, you mean?&#x201d; Agachak&#x2019;s face grew sly. &#x201c;You could evade that by coming to Mallorea with me.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Have I been going too fast for you, Agachak?

She finds things worse than when she left. She despises the men she serves, the oligarchs, and crooks, and thugs of Putin&#x2019;s Russia. What no one knows is that Dominika is working for CIA as Washington&#x2019;s most sensitive penetration of SVR and the Kremlin.<br> <br>Complicating the mortal risks Dominika must take is the fact that she is in love with her CIA handler, Nate Nash, a lust that is as dangerous to both of them as committing espionage in Moscow. Dominika&#x2019;s life is further complicated when Russian President Putin casts ice-blue eyes in her direction. As she expertly dodges exposure, Dominika deals with a murderously psychotic boss, survives an Iranian assassination attempt, and tries to rescue an arrested double agent&#x2014;and thwart Putin&#x2019;s threatening flirtations. These things never end well.<br> <br>&#x201c;Jason Matthews has resurrected the spy novel...to reflect the deadly serious stakes of the new Cold War. On a scale of one to five stars, <i>Palace of Treason</i> is a six&#x201d; (<i>New York Journal of Books</i>). A grand, wildly entertaining ride through the steel-trap mind of a CIA insider, this is a story &#x201c;as suspenseful and cinematic as the best spy movies&#x201d; (<i>The Philadelphia Inquirer</i>).</p><p>Jason Matthews is a retired officer of the CIA&#x2019;s Operations Directorate.

He lives in Southern California.Palace of Treason 1<p></p> <br>Captain Dominika Egorova of the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service, the SVR, pulled the hem of her little black dress down as she weaved through the crowds of pedestrians in the red neon, pranging chaos of Boulevard de Clichy in the Pigalle. Her black heels clicked on the Parisian sidewalk as she held her chin up, keeping the gray head of the rabbit in sight ahead of her&#x2014;solo trailing surveillance on a moving foot target, one of the more difficult skills in offensive streetcraft. Dominika covered him loosely, alternately paralleling on the dividing island in the center of the boulevard and drafting behind the early evening pedestrians to screen her profile.<br> <br>The man stopped to buy a charred kebab skewer&#x2014;typically pork in this Christian quarter&#x2014;from a vendor who fanned the charcoal of a small brazier with a folded piece of cardboard, sending an occasional spark into the passing crowd and enveloping the street corner in clouds of smoke fragrant with coriander and chili. Dominika eased back behind a street pole: it was unlikely that the rabbit was using the snack stop as a way to check his six&#x2014;for the last three days he had shown himself to be oblivious on the street&#x2014;but she wanted to avoid his noticing her too soon. Plenty of other street creatures already had watched her passing through the crowd&#x2014;dancer&#x2019;s legs, regal bust, arc-light-blue eyes&#x2014;cutting her scent, sniffing for strength or frailty.<br> <br>In two practiced glances, Dominika checked the zoo of faces but did not get that tingle on the back of her neck that meant the start of trouble. The rabbit, a Persian, finished tearing the strips of meat with his teeth and tossed the short skewer into the gutter. Apparently this Shia Muslim had no compunctions about eating pork&#x2014;or slathering his face between the legs of hookers, for that matter. He started moving again, Dominika keeping pace.<br> <br>An unshaven and swarthy young man left his friends leaning against the steam-weeping window of a noodle shop, slid in beside Dominika, and put an arm around her shoulder. &#x201c;Je bande pour toi,&#x201d; he said in the crooked French of the Maghreb&#x2014;he had a hard-on for her. Jesus. She had no time for this, and felt the smoldering surge in her stomach running into her arms. No. Become ice. She shook his arm off, pushed his face away, and kept walking. &#x201c;Va voir ailleurs si j&#x2019;y suis&#x201d;&#x2014;go somewhere else, see if I&#x2019;m there&#x2014;she said over her shoulder. The young man stopped short, made an obscene gesture, and spat on the sidewalk.<br> <br>Dominika reacquired the Persian&#x2019;s gray head just as the man entered La Diva, passing through the scrolling lights framing the dance hall&#x2019;s entrance. She drifted toward the door, noted the heavy velvet curtain, and gave him a beat to get inside, this diminutive man who held the nuclear secrets of the Islamic Republic of Iran in his head. He was her prey, a human intelligence target. Dominika ran the edge of her will rasping across the whetstone of her mind. It was to be a hostile recruitment attempt, an ambush, coercive, a cold pitch, and she thought she had an even chance to flip him in the next half hour.<br> <br>Tonight Dominika wore her brown hair down around her shoulders, bangs covering one eye, like an Apache dancer from the 1920s. She wore square-framed tortoiseshell eyeglasses with clear lenses, a Parisian Lois Lane out for the night. But the typing-pool effect was spoiled by the low-cut black sheath dress and Louboutin pumps. She was a former ballerina, her legs shapely and knotted in the calves, though she walked with a nearly imperceptible limp from a right foot shattered by a ballet-academy rival when Dominika was twenty years old.<br> <br><br> <br>Paris. She hadn&#x2019;t breathed the air of the West since she returned to Moscow after being exchanged in a spy swap on a bridge in Estonia months ago. The images of the exchange were fading, the sound of her long-ago steps on the silver-wet bridge increasingly muffled, draped in the fog of that night. Returned home, she had inhaled the Russian air deeply; it was her country, Rodina, the Motherland, but the clean bite of pine forest and loamy black earth was tainted by a hint of liquid corruption, like a dead animal beneath the floorboards. Of course, she had been greeted back home enthusiastically, with florid kudos and good wishes from lumpy officials. She had reported for work at SVR Headquarters&#x2014;referred to as the Center&#x2014;immediately, but seeing her colleagues in the Service once again, the milling herd of the siloviki, the anointed inner circle, had collapsed her spirit. What did you expect? she thought.<br> <br>Things were different with her now. Exquisitely, massively, dangerously different. She had been recruited by a CIA case officer&#x2014;with whom she had fallen in love&#x2014;then vetted, trained, and directed to return to Moscow as a penetration of the Center. She was learning to wait, to listen, to appear to be a wholly quiescent creature of the mephitic atmosphere of her Service. To that end, she had demurred when several idiotic headquarters positions were offered to her&#x2014;she would wait for a job with the kind of access CIA really wanted. She feigned interest in the process and otherwise took the time to attend a short course in operational psychology, and another in counterintelligence: It might be useful in the future to know how mole hunters in her Service would be hunting, how the footsteps in the stairwell would sound when they came for her.<br> <br>She bided her time by looking into their souls, for Dominika was born a synesthete, with a brain wired to see colored auras around people and thereby read passion, treachery, fear, or deception. When she was five years old, Dominika&#x2019;s synesthesia shocked and worried her professor father and musician mother. They made their little girl promise never to reveal this soaring precocity to anyone, even as she grew accustomed to it. At twenty, Dominika was lifted on maroon waves of music at the ballet academy. At twenty-five, she calibrated a man&#x2019;s lust by his scarlet halo. Now just past thirty, being able to divine men&#x2019;s and women&#x2019;s spirits just possibly would save her life.<br> <br>There was something else. Since her recruitment, Dominika had been visited by images of her late mother, a benign chimera that would appear by her side to offer encouragement and support. Russians are spiritual and emotional, so fondly remembering ancestors was not at all creepy or demented. At least Dominika didn&#x2019;t worry about it, and besides, her mother&#x2019;s spirit fortified her as she resumed her double life, a shimmering hand on her shoulder as she stood at the mouth of the dark cave, smelling the beast inside, willing herself to get on with it.<br> <br>On her return to the Center from the West, there had been two clearance sessions with an oily little man from counterespionage and a saturnine female stenographer. He asked about the ubiytsa, the Spetsnaz assassin who had almost killed her in Athens, and then about being in CIA custody: what the CIA men had been like, what the Americans asked her, what she told them; Dominika had stared down the stenographer, who was swaddled in a yellow haze&#x2014;deceit and avarice&#x2014;and replied that she told them nothing. The bear sniffed at her shoes and nodded, apparently satisfied. But the bear was never satisfied, she thought. It never was.<br> <br>Her exploits, and near escapes, and contact with the Americans cast suspicion on her&#x2014;as it was with anyone returning from active service in the West&#x2014;and she knew the liver-eyed lizards of the FSB, the Federal Security Service, were observing her, waiting for a ripple, watching for an email or postcard from abroad, or an inexplicable, cryptic telephone call from a Moscow suburb, or an observed contact with a foreigner. But there were no ripples. Dominika was normal in her patterns; there was nothing for them to see.<br> <br>So they placed a handsome physical trainer to bump her during the &#x201c;mandatory&#x201d; self-defense course run in an old mansion in Domodedovo, on Varshavskaya Ulitsa off the MKAD ring road. The moldy, spavined house with creaky staircases and a green-streaked copper roof was nestled in an unkempt botanical garden hidden behind a wall with a crooked sign reading VILAR INSTITUTE OF OFFICINAL PLANTS. A few bored class participants&#x2014;a florid Customs Service woman and two overage border guards&#x2014;sat and smoked on benches along the walls of the glassed-in winter garden that served as the practice area.<br> <br>Daniil, the trainer, was a tall, blond Great Russian, about thirty-five years old and imperially slim, with sturdy wrists and pianist&#x2019;s hands. His features were delicate: Jawline, cheek, and brow were finely formed, and the impossibly long lashes above the sleepy blue eyes could stir the potted palm fronds in the winter garden from across the room. Dominika knew there was no such thing as a mandatory self-defense class in SVR, and that Daniil most likely was a ringer dispatched to casually ask questions and eventually elicit from an unwary Dominika that she had colluded with a foreign intelligence service, or passed state secrets, or seduced multiple debauched partners in hot upper berths of swaying midnight trains. It didn&#x2019;t matter what transgressions they harvested. The counterintelligence hounds couldn&#x2019;t define treason, but they&#x2019;d know it when they saw it.<br> <br>She certainly was not expecting to be taught anything along the lines of close-quarters fighting techniques. On the first day, with dappled sunlight coming through the grimy glass ceiling of the winter garden, Dominika was intrigued to see a pale-blue aura of artful thought and soul swirling around Daniil&#x2019;s head and from the tips of his fingers. She was additionally surprised when Daniil began instructing her in Sistema Rukopashnogo Boya, the Russian hand-to-hand combat system, medieval, brutal, rooted in tenth-century Cossack tradition with mystical connections to the Orthodox Church. It was normally taught only to Russian military personnel.<br> <br>She had seen the Spetsnaz assassin use the same moves in the blood-splattered Athens hotel room, not recognizing them for what they were, but horrified at their buttery efficiency. Daniil spared her nothing in training, and she found she enjoyed physically working her body again, remembering the long-ago discipline of her cherished dancing career, the career They had taken away from her. Sistema put a premium on flexibility, ballistic speed, and knowledge of vulnerable points on the human body. As Daniil demonstrated joint locks and submission holds, his face close to Dominika&#x2019;s, he saw something in her fifty-fathom eyes he wouldn&#x2019;t want to stir up unnecessarily.<br> <br>After two weeks, Dominika was mastering strikes and throws that would have taken other students months to learn. She had initially covered her mouth and laughed at the bent-leg monkey walk used to close with an opponent in combat, and the swirling shoulder shrug that preceded a devastating hand strike. Now, she was knocking Daniil down on the mat as often as he dumped her. In the dusty afternoon light of the room, Dominika watched Daniil&#x2019;s back muscles flex as he demonstrated a new technique and she idly wondered about him. The way he moved, he could have been a ballet dancer, or a gymnast. How had he gotten into the killing martial arts? Was he Spetsnaz, from a Vympel group? She had noticed, with the eye of a Sparrow&#x2014;a trained seductress of the state&#x2014;that his ring finger was significantly longer than his index finger. The likelihood existed therefore, according to the warty matrons at Sparrow School, of above-average-sized courting tackle.<br> <br>Estimating the size of a man was not the only thing Dominika had learned at State School Four, Sparrow School, the secret sexpionage academy that trained women in the art of seduction. The classrooms and auditoria in the walled, peeling mansion in the pine forest outside the city of Kazan on the banks of the Volga were in her mind still. She could hear the droning clinical lectures on human sexuality and love. She could see the jumpy, roiling films of coitus and perversion. The lists of sexual techniques, numbered in the hundreds, endlessly memorized and practiced&#x2014;No. 88, &#x201c;Butterfly wings&#x201d;; No. 42, &#x201c;String of pearls&#x201d;; No. 32, &#x201c;The carpet tack&#x201d;&#x2014;would come back to her, uninvited thoughts of the numb days and evil nights, and everything sprinkled with rose water to cloak the musk of rampant male and lathered female, and the dirty-nailed hands squeezing her thighs, and the drops of sweat that hung from the fleshy noses that inevitably, unavoidably, would drip onto her face. She had endured it to spite the svini, the pigs, all of them, who thought she would lie on her back and open her legs. And she would now show them how wrong they were.<br> <br>Calm down, she told herself. She was fighting the building stress of being back in Russia&#x2019;s service, in the embrace of the Motherland, the start of an impossibly risky existence. There was additional anguish: She didn&#x2019;t know whether the man she loved was still alive. And if he was still breathing, her love was a secret she would have to guard to her core, because there was the small detail that he was an American case officer of CIA. She waited for the overdue start of Daniil&#x2019;s sly elicitation, plausible after the earned familiarity of fourteen days of physical training. She would have to be exceedingly careful&#x2014;no baiting, no sarcasm&#x2014;but it was also an opening for a well-timed bit of dezinformatsiya, deception, perhaps a sly hint about her admiration for President Putin. Everything she told Daniil would go back to the FSB, and then the Center, and be compiled with all the other pieces of the &#x201c;welcome home&#x201d; investigation, and ultimately determine whether she would retain her status as an operupolnomochenny, an operations officer. But my, those eyelashes.<br> <br><br> <br>Dominika held her head erect, elegant on a long neck, as she pushed through the musky velvet curtain into the La Diva club. The bouncer at the inner door looked with professional approval at her little black dress, then glanced briefly into her tiny black satin clutch, barely large enough to hold a lipstick and wafer-thin smartphone. He pulled the heavy curtain aside and motioned her to enter. No weapons, he thought. Mademoiselle Doudounes, Miss Big Chest, is clean.<br> <br>Captain Egorova was in fact more than able to dispense lethal force. The lipstick tube in her purse was an elektricheskiy pistolet, a single-shot electric gun, a recent update from SVR technical&#x2014;Line T&#x2014;laboratories, a new version of a venerable Cold War weapon. The disposable lipstick gun fired a murderously explosive 9mm Makarov cartridge accurately out to two meters&#x2014;the bullet had a compressed metal dust core that expanded massively on contact. The only sound at discharge was a single loud click.<br> <br>Dominika scanned the black-lit interior of the club, a large semicircular room filled with chipped tables in the center and tired leatherette booths along the walls. A low stage with old-timey footlights stood dark and empty. Her target, Parvis Jamshidi, sat alone in a center booth pensively looking up at the ceiling. Dominika did a second quick scan, quartering the room, focusing on the far corners: No obvious countersurveillance or lounging bodyguard. She weaved between the tables toward Jamshidi&#x2019;s booth, ignoring the snapped fingers of a fat man at a table, signaling her to come over, either to order another petit jaune or to suggest they go together for thirty minutes to the Chat Noir Design Hotel down the block.<br> <br>She was keyed up as the familiar feel of the hunt, of contact with the opposition, rose in her throat, tightened across her chest, and switched o...</p><h2>Dr. Blaylock&#39;s Prescriptions for Natural Health: 70 Remedies for Common Conditions</h2><p><br><b>HEALTH SECRETS THAT CAN SAVE YOUR LIFE</b><br>Do you find your medical conditions don&#x2019;t get better and prescription drugs don&#x2019;t live up to expectations?<br>No matter how you feel right now, <i>Dr. Blaylock&#x2019;s Prescriptions for Natural Health</i> will give you the lifeline you need.

The word chakra originated with the Vedic teachings of ancient India. It comes from the Sanskrit word for "wheel of light," and denotes the energy centers that exist in every man and woman. <i>The Book of Chakras</i> explores the nature of these energy sources, explains where they dwell in each of us, and instructs on how to use them. The author identifies seven energy centers in the human body. The Root Chakra, located in the lower torso, anchors us in life. From that point on the rising ladder of love and healing, we become aware of the Sacral Chakra, the Solar Plexus Chakra, the Heart Chakra, the Throat Chakra, the Brow or Third Eye Chakra, and the Crown Chakra. The last, the Crown Chakra, located in the head, is the most refined and spiritual center in the human energy system. Chakra teachings describe seven bodies that make up every person's aura. They are the Physical, Etheric, Astral, Mental, Divine, Spiritual, and Soul bodies. Chakra teachings say that each of these bodies vibrates in ways that are allied to the colors of the universe. However, only one of these bodies, the Physical, is visible. When we understand these bodies in detail, we become able to correct chakra imbalances and harness our powers for peaceful and productive living. The author advises on ways of restoring balances, healing through the power of thought, and employing colors, sounds, crystals, acupuncture, and other means.

For centuries, Muslims have called attention to the father's forgiveness in this parable in order to question the need for a Mediator between humanity and God. In <em>The Cross the Prodigal,</em> Kenneth E. Bailey--New Testament scholar and long-time missionary to the Middle East--undertakes to answer this question. Drawing on his extensive knowledge of both the New Testament and Middle Eastern culture, Bailey presents an interpretation of this parable from a Middle Eastern perspective and, in doing so, powerfully demonstrates its essentially <em>Christian</em> message. Here Bailey highlights the underlying tensions between law and love, servanthood and sonship, honor and forgiveness that grant this story such timeless spiritual and theological power.</p><p><strong>Kenneth E. Bailey</strong> is an author and lecturer in Middle Eastern New Testament studies. An ordained Presbyterian minister, he also serves as Canon Theologian of the Diocese of Pittsburgh of the Episcopal Church, U.S.A. He holds graduate degrees in Arabic language and literature, and in systematic theology; his Th.D. is in New Testament. He spent forty years living and teaching New Testament in the Middle East. Bailey has written many books in English and in Arabic, including <em>Poet Peasant, Through Peasant Eyes</em> and <em>Jacob the Prodigal.</em>"It is an extremely rare event in New Testament studies when the historical expertise of the scholar is combined with the poetic imagination of the storyteller. Ken Bailey's <em>The Cross the Prodigal</em> unites the professor and the playwright. In the first section of the book the author's unique familiarity with Christian literature of Near Eastern provenance and his intimate knowledge of Near Eastern village life produce a fascinating explanation of the parable of the prodigal son, which emerges not as the sentimental account of the pilgrimage of a sorry sinner, but as the portrayal of God as a Father who pays every price possible in the search of two lost sons, a portrait contrary to all expectations associated with a patriarch. The book's second section is a play in four scenes in which this understanding of the parable is placed on the stage. Thus, exegetical theology is transformed back into its original medium, the telling of a story." (Ulrich Mauser, Otto A. Piper Professor of Biblical Theology Emeritus, Princeton Theological Seminary)<br><br>"This book is for those of us who long to know what Jesus was saying to his audience then, so that we can know what the Bible is saying to us now. Ken Bailey's work is very nourishing, spiritually and theologically. And if you like to be surprised with new insights, you will love <em>The Cross the Prodigal!</em>" (The Rev. Marian McClure, Ph.D., Director, Worldwide Ministries, Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.))<br><br>"In <em>The Cross the Prodigal,</em> Kenneth Bailey uses his rare and intimate familiarity with the peasant culture of the Middle East to illuminate three beloved parables: the lost sheep, the lost coin and the lost son. Bailey rightly believes that Christian communities with close connections to the biblical world have many things to teach us about the cultural background of biblical narrative. This classic work, newly revised, provides fresh perspectives for understanding the love of God the Father, and for seeing how the compassion of the cross is present already in the teaching ministry of Jesus Christ." (Philip Graham Ryken, Senior Minister, Tenth Presbyterian Church)<br><br>"Dr. Kenneth Bailey's unique perspective as one who has spent the better part of his life living in the Middle East unlocks the parables and teachings of our Lord Jesus in remarkably fresh ways. In the unfolding of the prodigal son Bailey demonstrates there is no forgiveness without great cost on the part of the forgiver. This revised edition is a wonderful update and expansion of an already excellent book. I am delighted to commend it." (The Right Reverend John W. Howe, D.D., Bishop, The Episcopal Church Diocese of Central Florida)<br><br>"<em>The Cross the Prodigal</em> is a little book that changed the minds of Gospel scholars throughout the world. In its original edition (1973) Bailey not only established himself as a leading New Testament interpreter, but he launched an approach to the Gospels that was utterly unique. Over sixty years of life in the Middle East (from Egypt to Iraq) bequeathed to him a discerning knowledge of peasant life; fluency in Arabic; the ability to work in Syriac, Coptic and Aramaic; and an intimate acquaintance with Rabbinic literature. These skills he now applies to the three parables of Luke 15 in order to unlock cultural insights that have eluded scholars for centuries. This approach deserves a name--Middle Eastern New Testament Studies--and today Bailey's legacy belongs with scholars such as Joachim Jeremias: leading parable interpreters whose work has been a watershed for the rest of us."

A deep reflection on the essential nature of both music and writing, <i>Absolutely on Music </i>is an unprecedented glimpse into the minds of two maestros.</p><p>Haruki Murakami was born in Kyoto in 1949 and now lives near Tokyo. His work has been translated into more than fifty languages, and the most recent of his many international honors is the Hans Christian Andersen Literature Award, whose previous recipients include J. K. Rowling, Isabel Allende, and Salman Rushdie.<br> www.harukimurakami.com<br> &nbsp;<br> Seiji Ozawa served as music director of the Boston Symphony Orchestra for twenty-nine years, and was music director of the Toronto Symphony Orchestra, the San Francisco Symphony, the Chicago Symphony Orchestra&#x2019;s Ravinia Festival, and Wiener Staatsoper. With Kazuyoshi Akiyama, he formed the Saito Kinen Orchestra and is the director of the Seiji Ozawa Matsumoto Festival. Ozawa has been deeply involved in musical education through his work with the Tanglewood Music Center Orchestra, the Ozawa International Chamber Music Academy Okushiga, the Seiji Ozawa International Academy Switzerland, and as founder of the Seiji Ozawa Music Academy Opera Project, organizations which provide opportunities to outstanding students in Asia and Europe. Among his many honors, Ozawa has been awarded France&#x2019;s Officier de la Lï¿½gion d&#x2019;Honneur, the Japanese Order of Culture, a Kennedy Center Honor, and a Grammy for Best Opera Recording.Introduction <br> My Afternoons with Seiji Ozawa<br> &nbsp;<br> Until we started the interviews in this book, I had never had a serious conversation with Seiji Ozawa about music. True, I lived in Boston from 1993 to 1995, while he was still music director of the Boston Symphony Orchestra, and I would often go to concerts he conducted, but I was just another anonymous fan in the audience. Not long after that, my wife and I happened to become friends with his daughter, Seira, and we would see and talk to her father now and then. But our acquaintance was casual and had nothing to do with either his work or mine. <br> &nbsp;<br> Perhaps one reason we never talked seriously about music until recently is that the maestro&#x2019;s work kept him so fully involved. As a result, whenever we got together to have a drink, we&#x2019;d talk about anything other than music. At most, we might have shared a few fragmentary remarks on some musical topics that never led anywhere. Ozawa is the type of person who focuses all his energy on his work, so that when he steps away from it, he needs to take a breather. Knowing this, I avoided bringing up musical topics when I was in his company.<br> &nbsp;<br> In December of 2009, however, Ozawa was found to have esophageal cancer, and after major surgery the following month, he had to restrict his musical activities, largely replacing them with a challenging program of recuperation and rehabilitation. Perhaps because of this regime, we gradually began to talk more about music whenever we met. As weakened as he was, he took on a new vitality whenever the topic turned to music. Even when talking with a musical layman such as myself, any sort of conversation about music seemed to provide the refreshment he needed. And the very fact that I was <i>not</i> in his field probably set him at ease.<br> &nbsp;<br> I have been a fervent jazz fan for close to half a century, but I have also been listening to classical music with no less enjoyment, collecting classical records since I was in high school, and going to concerts as often as time would permit. Especially when I was living in Europe&#x2014; from 1986 to 1989&#x2014;I was immersed in classical music. Listening to jazz and the classics has always been both an effective stimulus and a source of peace to my heart and mind. If someone told me that I could listen to only one or the other but not to both, my life would be immeasurably diminished. As Duke Ellington once said, &#x201c;There are simply two kinds of music, good music and the other kind.&#x201d; In that sense, jazz and classical music are fundamentally the same. The pure joy one experiences listening to &#x201c;good&#x201d; music transcends questions of genre. <br> &nbsp;<br> During one of Seiji Ozawa&#x2019;s visits to my home, we were listening to music and talking about one thing or another when he told me a tremendously interesting story about Glenn Gould and Leonard Bernstein&#x2019;s 1962 performance in New York of Brahms&#x2019;s First Piano Concerto. &#x201c;What a shame it would be to let such a fascinating story just evaporate,&#x201d; I thought. &#x201c;Somebody ought to record it and put it on paper.&#x201d; And, brazen as it may seem, the only &#x201c;somebody&#x201d; that happened to cross my mind at the moment was <i>me</i>. <br> &nbsp;<br> When I suggested this to Seiji Ozawa, he liked the idea immediately. &#x201c;Why not?&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve got plenty of time to spare these days. Let&#x2019;s do it.&#x201d; To have Seiji Ozawa ill with cancer was a heart-wrenching development for the music world, for me personally, and of course for him; but that it gave rise to this time for the two of us to sit and have good, long talks about music may be one of those rare silver linings that are not in fact to be found in every cloud.<br> &nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;<br> As much as I have loved music over the years, I never received a formal musical education, have virtually no technical knowledge of the field, and am a complete layman where most things musical are concerned. During our conversations, some of my comments may have been amateurish or even insulting, but Ozawa is not the sort of person to let such things bother him. He gave each remark serious thought and responded to each question, for which I was tremendously grateful. <br> &nbsp;<br> I handled the tape recorder, transcribed our conversations myself, and presented the manuscript to him for corrections. <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Come to think of it, I&#x2019;ve never really talked about music like this before, in such a focused, organized way.&#x201d; This was the very first thing Ozawa said to me after reading the finished manuscript. &#x201c;But wow, my language is so rough! Do you think readers are going to understand what I&#x2019;m saying?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> It&#x2019;s true, the maestro does speak his own special brand of Ozawa-ese, which is not always easy to convert to standard written Japanese. He gesticulates grandly, and many of his thoughts emerge in the form of songs. Still, whatever &#x201c;roughness&#x201d; there may be in the way he expresses himself, the feeling he seeks to convey comes through with startling immediacy, overarching the &#x201c;wall of words.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Despite being an amateur (or perhaps because of it), whenever I listen to music, I do so without preconceptions, simply opening my ears to the more wonderful passages and physically taking them in. When those wonderful passages are there, I feel joy, and when some parts are not so wonderful, I listen with a touch of regret. Beyond that, I might pause to think about what makes a certain passage wonderful or not so wonderful, but other musical elements are not that important to me. Basically, I believe that music exists to make people happy. In order to do so, those who make music use a wide range of techniques and methods which, in all their complexity, fascinate me in the simplest possible way.<br> &nbsp;<br> I tried my best to preserve this attitude when listening to what Maestro Ozawa had to say. In other words, I tried my best to remain an honest and curious amateur listener on the assumption that most of the people reading this book would be amateur music fans like me.<br> &nbsp;<br> *******<br> &nbsp;<br> At the risk of sounding somewhat presumptuous, I confess that in the course of our many conversations, I began to suspect that Seiji Ozawa and I might have several things in common. Questions of talent or productivity or fame aside, what I mean here is that I can feel a sense of identity in the way we live our lives.<br> &nbsp;<br> First of all, both of us seem to take the same simple joy in our work. Whatever differences there might be between making music and writing fiction, both of us are happiest when absorbed in our work. And the very fact that we are able to become so totally engrossed in it gives us the deepest satisfaction. What we end up producing as a result of that work may well be important, but aside from that, our ability to work with utter concentration and to devote ourselves to it so completely that we forget the passage of time is its own irreplaceable reward.<br> &nbsp;<br> Secondly, we both maintain the same &#x201c;hungry heart&#x201d; we possessed in our youth, that persistent feeling that &#x201c;this is not good enough,&#x201d; that we must dig deeper, forge farther ahead. This is the major motif of our work and our lives. Observing Ozawa in action, I could feel the depth and intensity of the desire he brought to his work. He was convinced of his own rightness and proud of what he was doing, but not in the least satisfied with it. I could see he knew he should be able to make the music even better, even deeper, and he was determined to make it happen even as he struggled with the constraints of time and his own physical strength.<br> &nbsp;<br> The third of our shared traits is stubbornness. We&#x2019;re patient, tough, and, finally, just plain stubborn. Once we&#x2019;ve decided to do something in a certain way, it doesn&#x2019;t matter what anybody else says, that&#x2019;s how we&#x2019;re going to do it. And even if, as a result, we find ourselves in dire straits, possibly even hated, we will take responsibility for our actions without making excuses. Ozawa is an utterly unpretentious person who is constantly cracking jokes, but he is also extremely sensitive to his surroundings, and his priorities are clear. Once he has made his mind up, he doesn&#x2019;t waver. Or at least that is how he appears to me.<br> &nbsp;<br> I have met many different people in the course of my life, some of whom I have come to know pretty well, but where these three traits are concerned, I had never encountered anyone before Seiji Ozawa with whom I found it so easy and natural to identify. In that sense, he is a precious person to me. It sets my mind at ease to know that there is someone like him in the world.<br> &nbsp;<br> Of course, we are also different in many ways. For example, I lack his easy sociability. I do have my own sort of curiosity about other people, but in my case it rarely comes to the surface. As a conductor of orchestras, Ozawa is quite naturally in touch with a large number of people on a daily basis and has to act as the guiding member of a team. But no matter how talented he might be, people would not follow him if he were constantly moody and difficult. Interpersonal relations take on a great significance. A conductor needs like-minded musical colleagues, and he is often called upon to perform social and even entrepreneurial tasks. He has to give much thought to his audiences. And as a musician, he has to devote a good deal of energy to the guidance of the next generation.<br> &nbsp;<br> By contrast, as a novelist I am free to spend my life hardly seeing or talking to anyone for days at a time, and never appearing in the media. I rarely have to do anything that involves teamwork, and while it&#x2019;s best to have some colleagues, I don&#x2019;t especially need any. I just have to stay in the house and write&#x2014;alone. The thought of guiding the next generation has never crossed my mind, I&#x2019;m sorry to say (not that anyone has ever asked me to do such a thing). I&#x2019;m sure there are significant differences in mentality that come from such differences in our professional functions, not to mention innate personality differences. But I suspect that on the most basic level, deep down in the bedrock, our similarities outnumber our differences.<br> &nbsp;<br> Creative people have to be fundamentally egoistic. This may sound pompous, but it happens to be the truth. People who live their lives watching what goes on around them, trying not to make waves, and looking for the easy compromise are not going to be able to do creative work, whatever their field. To build something where there was nothing requires deep individual concentration, and in most cases that kind of concentration occurs in a place unrelated to cooperation with others, a place we might even call <i>dï¿½monisch</i>.<br> &nbsp;<br> Still, letting one&#x2019;s ego run wild on the assumption that one is an &#x201c;artist&#x201d; will disrupt any kind of social life, which in turn interrupts the &#x201c;individual concentration&#x201d; so indispensable for creativity. Baring the ego in the late nineteenth century was one thing, but now, in the twenty-first century, it is a far more difficult matter. Creative professionals constantly have to find those realistic points of compromise between themselves and their environment<br> &nbsp;<br> What I am trying to say here is that while Ozawa and I of course have found very different ways to establish those points of compromise, we are likely headed in pretty much the same direction. And while we may set very different priorities, the way we set them may be quite similar. Which is why I was able to listen to his stories with something more than mere sympathy.</p><h2>Ethical Leadership and Decision Making in Education: Applying Theoretical Perspectives to Complex Dilemmas</h2><p><p></p> <p>The fourth edition of the best-selling text, <i>Ethical Leadership and Decision Making in Education</i>, continues to address the increasing interest in ethics and assists educational leaders with the complex dilemmas in today&#x2019;s challenging and diverse society.

Said Salisbury, &#x201c;We are fish.&#x201d;4<br>When the queen called him to form a new government for the third time in 1895, Lord Salisbury pursued his old policy of &#x201c;splendid isolation.&#x201d; But in the years since he and Disraeli had traveled to the Congress of Berlin in 1878, to create with Bismarck a new balance of power in Europe, their world had vanished.<br>In the Sino-Japanese war of 1894&#x2013;95, Japan defeated China, seized Taiwan, and occupied the Liaotung Peninsula. Britain&#x2019;s preeminent position in China was now history.<br>In the summer of 1895, London received a virtual ultimatum from secretary of state Richard Olney, demanding that Great Britain accept U.S. arbitration in a border dispute between British Guiana and Venezuela. Lord Salisbury shredded Olney&#x2019;s note like an impatient tenured professor cutting up a freshman term paper. But President Cleveland demanded that Britain accept arbitration&#x2014;or face the prospect of war with the United States.<br>The British were stunned by American enthusiasm for a war over a patch of South American jungle, and incredulous. America deployed two battleships to Britain&#x2019;s forty-four.5 Yet Salisbury took the threat seriously: &#x201c;A war with America . . . in the not distant future has become something more than a possibility.&#x201d;6<br>London was jolted anew in January 1896 when the Kaiser sent a telegram of congratulations to Boer leader Paul Kruger on his capture of the Jameson raiders, who had invaded the Transvaal in a land grab concocted by Cecil Rhodes, with the connivance of Colonial Secretary Joseph Chamberlain.<br>These two challenges, from a jingoistic America that was now the first economic power on earth, and from his bellicose nephew in Berlin, Wilhelm II, revealed to the future Edward VII that &#x201c;his country was without a friend in the world&#x201d; and &#x201c;steps to end British isolation were required. . . .&#x201d;7<br>On December 18, 1897, a Russian fleet steamed into the Chinese harbor of Port Arthur, &#x201c;obliging British warships to vacate the area.&#x201d;8 British jingoes &#x201c;became apoplectic.&#x201d;9 Lord Salisbury stood down: &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think we carry enough guns to fight them and the French together.&#x201d;10<br>In 1898, a crisis erupted in northeast Africa. Captain Jean-Baptiste Marchand, who had set off from Gabon in 1897 on a safari across the Sahara with six officers and 120 Senegalese, appeared at Fashoda in the southern Sudan, where he laid claim to the headwaters of the Nile. Sir Herbert Kitchener cruised upriver to instruct Marchand he was on imperial land. Faced with superior firepower, Marchand withdrew. Fashoda brought Britain and France to the brink of war. Paris backed down, but bitterness ran deep. Caught up in the Anglophobia was eight-year-old Charles de Gaulle.11<br>In 1900, the Russian challenge reappeared. After American, British, French, German, and Japanese troops had marched to the rescue of the diplomatic legation in Peking, besieged for fifty-five days by Chinese rebels called &#x201c;Boxers,&#x201d; Russia exploited the chaos to send a 200,000-man army into Manchuria and the Czar shifted a squadron of his Baltic fleet to Port Arthur. The British position in China was now threatened by Russia and Japan.<br>But what awakened Lord Salisbury to the depth of British isolation was the Boer War. When it broke out in 1899, Europeans and Americans cheered British defeats. While Joe Chamberlain might &#x201c;speak of the British enjoying a &#x2018;splendid isolation, surrounded and supported by our kinsfolk,&#x2019; the Boer War brought home the reality that, fully extended in their imperial role, the British needed to avoid conflict with the other great powers.&#x201d;12<br>Only among America&#x2019;s Anglophile elite could Victoria&#x2019;s nation or Salisbury&#x2019;s government find support. When Bourke Cockran,&nbsp;a Tammany Hall Democrat, wrote President McKinley, urging&nbsp;<br>him to mediate and keep America&#x2019;s distance from Great Britain&#x2019;s &#x201c;wanton acts of aggression,&#x201d; the letter went to Secretary of State John Hay.13<br>Hay bridled at this Celtic insolence. &#x201c;Mr. Cockran&#x2019;s logic is especially Irish,&#x201d; he wrote to a friend. &#x201c;As long as I stay here no action shall be taken contrary to my conviction that the one indispensable feature of our foreign policy should be a friendly understanding with England.&#x201d; Hay refused even to answer &#x201c;Bourke Cockran&#x2019;s fool letter to the president.&#x201d;14<br>Hay spoke of an alliance with Britain as an &#x201c;unattainable dream&#x201d; and hoped for a smashing imperial victory in South Africa. &#x201c;I hope if it comes to blows that England will make quick work of Uncle Paul [Kruger].&#x201d;15<br>Entente Cordiale<br>So it was that as the nineteenth century came to an end Britain set out to court old rivals. The British first reached out to the Americans. Alone among Europe&#x2019;s great powers, Britain sided with the United States in its 1898 war with Spain. London then settled the Alaska boundary dispute in America&#x2019;s favor, renegotiated the fifty-year-old Clayton-Bulwer Treaty, and ceded to America the exclusive rights to build, operate, and fortify a canal across Panama. Then Britain withdrew her fleet from the Caribbean.<br>Writes British historian Correlli Barnett: &#x201c;The passage of the British battlefleet from the Atlantic to the Pacific would now be by courtesy of the United States,&#x201d; and, with America&#x2019;s defeat of Spain, &#x201c;The Philippines, Cuba and Puerto Rico, now American colonies, were gradually closed to British merchants by protective tariffs, for the benefit of their American rivals.&#x201d;16<br>Other historians, however, hail the British initiative to terminate a century of U.S.-British enmity as &#x201c;The Great Rapprochement,&#x201d; and Berlin-born Yale historian Hajo Holborn regards the establishment of close Anglo-American relations as probably &#x201c;by far the greatest achievement of British diplomacy in terms of world history.&#x201d;17<br>With America appeased, Britain turned to Asia.<br>With a Russian army in Manchuria menacing Korea and the Czar&#x2019;s warships at Port Arthur and Vladivostok, Japan needed an ally to balance off Russia&#x2019;s ally, France. Germany would not do, as Kaiser Wilhelm disliked Orientals and was endlessly warning about the &#x201c;Yellow Peril.&#x201d; As for the Americans, their Open Door policy had proven to be bluster and bluff when Russia moved into Manchuria. That left the British, whom the Japanese admired as an island people and warrior race that had created the world&#x2019;s greatest empire.<br>On January 30, 1902, an Anglo-Japanese treaty was signed. Each nation agreed to remain neutral should the other become embroiled in an Asian war with a single power. However, should either become involved in war with two powers, each would come to the aid of the other. Confident its treaty with Britain would checkmate Russia&#x2019;s ally France, Japan in 1904 launched a surprise attack on the Russian naval squadron at Port Arthur. An enraged Czar sent his Baltic fleet to exact retribution. After a voyage of six months from the Baltic to the North Sea, down the Atlantic and around the Cape of Good Hope to the Indian Ocean, the great Russian fleet was ambushed and annihilated by Admiral Heihachiro Togo in Tshushima Strait between Korea and Japan. Only one small Russian cruiser and two destroyers made it to Vladivostok. Japan lost two torpedo boats. It was a victory for Japan to rival the sinking of the Spanish Armada and the worst defeat ever inflicted on a Western power by an Asian people.<br>Britain had chosen well. In 1905, the Anglo-Japanese treaty was elevated into a full alliance. Britain now turned to patching up quarrels with her European rivals. Her natural allies were Germany and the Habsburg Empire, neither of whom had designs on the British Empire. Imperial Russia, Britain&#x2019;s great nineteenth-century rival, was pressing down on China, India, Afghanistan, the Turkish Straits, and the Middle East. France was Britain&#x2019;s ancient enemy and imperial rival in Africa and Egypt. The nightmare of the British was a second Tilsit, where Napoleon and Czar Alexander I, meeting on a barge in the Neiman in 1807, had divided a prostrate Europe and Middle East&nbsp;between them. Germany was the sole European bulwark against&nbsp;a French-Russian dominance of Europe and drive for hegemony&nbsp;in Africa, the Middle East, and Asia&#x2014;at the expense of the British&nbsp;Empire.<br>With Lord Salisbury&#x2019;s blessing, Joe Chamberlain began to court Berlin. &#x201c;England, Germany and America should collaborate: by so doing they could check Russian expansionism, calm turbulent France and guarantee world peace,&#x201d; Chamberlain told future German chancellor Bernhard von Bulow.18 The Kaiser put him off. Neither he nor his advisers believed Britain could reconcile with her old nemesis France, or Russia, and must eventually come to Berlin hat-in-hand. Joe warned the Germans: Spurn Britain, and we go elsewhere.<br>The Kaiser let the opportunity slip and, in April 1904, learned to his astonishment that Britain and France had negotiated an entente cordiale, a cordial understanding. France yielded all claims in Egypt, and Britain agreed to support France&#x2019;s preeminence in Morocco. Centuries of hostility came to an end. The quarrel over Suez was over. Fashoda was history.<br>The entente quickly proved its worth. After the Kaiser was persuaded to make a provocative visit to Tangier in 1905, Britain backed France at the Algeciras conference called to resolve the crisis. Germany won economic concessions in Morocco, but Berlin had solidified the Anglo-French entente. More ominous, the Tangier crisis had propelled secret talks already under way between French and British staff officers over how a British army might be ferried across the Channel to France in the event of a war with Germany.<br>Unknown to the Cabinet and Parliament, a tiny cabal had made a decision fateful for Britain, the empire, and the world. Under the guidance of Edward Grey, the foreign secretary from 1905 to 1916, British and French officers plotted Britain&#x2019;s entry into a Franco-German war from the first shot. And these secret war plans were being formulated by Liberals voted into power in public revulsion against the Boer War on a platform of &#x201c;Peace, Retrenchment, and Reform.&#x201d; Writes historian Robert Massie,<br>[O]n January 16 [1906], without the approval of either the Prime Minister or Cabinet, secret talks between British and French staff officers began. They focussed on plans to send 100,000 British soldiers to the Continent within two weeks of an outbreak of hostilities. On January 26, when Campbell-Bannerman returned to London and was informed, he approved.19<br>As Churchill wrote decades later, only Lord Rosebery read&nbsp;the real meaning of the Anglo-French entente. &#x201c;Only one voice&#x2014;Rosebery&#x2019;s&#x2014;was raised in discord: in public &#x2018;Far more likely to lead to War than Peace&#x2019;; in private &#x2018;Straight to War.&#x2019; &#x201d;20 While praising Rosebery&#x2019;s foresight, Churchill never repudiated his own support of the entente or secret understandings: &#x201c;It must not be thought that I regret the decisions which were in fact taken.&#x201d;21<br>In August 1907, Britain entered into an Anglo-Russian convention, ending their eighty-year conflict. Czar Nicholas II accepted Britain&#x2019;s dominance in southern Persia. Britain accepted Russia&#x2019;s dominance in the north. Both agreed to stay out of central Persia, Afghanistan, and Tibet. The Great Game was over and the lineups completed for the great European war. In the Triple Alliance were Germany, Austria-Hungary, and Italy. Opposite was the Franco-Russian alliance backed by Great Britain, which was allied to Japan. Only America among the great powers remained free of entangling alliances.<br>&#x201c;You Have a New World&#x201d;<br>Britain had appeased America, allied with Japan, and entered an entente with France and Russia, yet its German problem remained. It had arisen in the aftermath of the Franco-Prussian war. After the French defeat at Sedan and the abdication of Napoleon III, a united Germany stretching from France to Russia and from the Baltic to the Alps had emerged as the first power in Europe. Disraeli recognized the earthshaking importance of the unification of the German states under a Prussian king.<br>The war represents the German revolution, a greater political event than the French revolution of the last century. . . . There is not a diplomatic tradition, which has not been swept away. You have a new world. . . . The balance of power has been entirely destroyed.22<br>Bismarck had engineered the wars on Denmark, Austria, and France, but he now believed his nation had nothing to gain from war. She had &#x201c;hay enough for her fork.&#x201d;23 Germany should not behave &#x201c;like a nouveau riche who has just come into money and then offended everyone by pointing to the coins in his pocket.&#x201d;24 He crafted a series of treaties to maintain a European balance of power favorable to Germany&#x2014;by keeping the Austro-Hungarian Empire allied, Russia friendly, Britain neutral, and France isolated. Bismarck opposed the building of a fleet that might alarm the British. As for an overseas empire, let Britain, France, and Russia quarrel over colonies. When a colonial adventurer pressed upon him Germany&#x2019;s need to enter the scramble for Africa, Bismarck replied, &#x201c;Your map of Africa is very nice. But there is France, and here is Russia, and we are in the&nbsp;middle, and that is my map of Africa.&#x201d;25<br>As the clamor for colonies grew, however, the Iron Chancellor would succumb and Germany would join the scramble. By 1914, Berlin boasted the world&#x2019;s third largest overseas empire, encompassing German East Africa (Tanganyika), South-West Africa (Namibia), Kamerun (Cameroon), and Togoland. On the China coast, the Kaiser held Shantung Peninsula. In the western Pacific, the House of Hohenzollern held German New Guinea, German Samoa, the Bismarck Archipelago, the Marshall, Mariana, and Caroline islands, and the Northern Solomons, of which Bougainville was the largest. However, writes Holborn,<br>Not for a moment were Bismarck&#x2019;s colonial projects intended to constitute a revision of the fundamentals of his continental policy. Least of all were they designs to undermine British naval or colonial supremacy overseas. Bismarck was frank when he told British statesmen that Germany, by the acquisition of colonies, was giving Britain new hostages, since she could not hope to defend them in an emergency.26<br>By 1890, Bismarck had been dismissed by the new young Kaiser, who began to make a series of blunders, the first of which was to let Bismarck&#x2019;s treaty with Russia lapse. This left Russia nowhere to turn but France. By 1894, St. Petersburg had become the ally of a Paris still seething over the loss of Alsace-Lorraine. France had broken free of the isolation imposed upon her by Bismarck. The Kaiser&#x2019;s folly in letting the Reinsurance Treaty with Russia lapse can hardly be overstated.<br>While Germany was a &#x201c;satiated power, so far as Europe itself was concerned, and stood to gain little from a major war on the European continent,&#x201d; France and Russia were expansionist.27 ...</p><h2>Healing</h2><p>This revised and expanded edition of MacNutt's bestselling book <i>Healing</i>, which has sold over 400,000 copies in its lifetime, provides a context within which to understand healing.

In the first ever memoir by a top-level operative to be authorized by the CIA, Antonio J. Mendez reveals the cunning tricks and insights that helped save hundreds from deadly situations.</p><p>Adept at creating new identities for anyone, anywhere, Mendez was involved in operations all over the world, from &#x201c;Wild West&#x201d; adventures in East Asia to Cold War intrigue in Moscow. In 1980, he orchestrated the escape of six Americans from a hostage situation in revolutionary Tehran, Iran. This extraordinary operation inspired the movie <em>Argo</em>, directed by and starring Ben Affleck.</p><p><em>The Master of Disguise</em> gives us a privileged look at what really happens at the highest levels of international espionage: in the field, undercover, and behind closed doors.</p></p><p>The problem with memoirs by ex-secret agents is that they usually make their careers sound about as exciting as that of $6-an-hour bowling alley security guard, unless you're of the opinion that filing papers and making phone calls is the epitome of thrills. Antonio Mendez, however, has produced a tome that makes the life of a CIA agent sound every bit the slam-bang world of intrigue and skulking in the shadows that movies like <i>Mission: Impossible</i> make it out to be.<p> Honored by the CIA on its 50th anniversary as being one of the agency's 50 "Trailblazers," the now-retired Mendez spins a fast-paced tale of intriguing characters partaking in skullduggery in exotic locales, made all the more appealing because Mendez himself is the featured star of the proceedings. In an almost offhand manner, he writes about seeing and doing things that would wilt the flower of courage in almost any reader. "Was I proud to be enlisting," he rhetorically ponders at one point, "on our side in the Cold War? You bet." Originally drafted by the CIA as a "technical artist" to provide cover for agents behind enemy lines, Mendez worked his way up the ladder and progressed to a full-fledged agent in the field, sneaking diplomats past enemy guards and spiriting informants into the night, eluding capture and torture at every turn--and using his artist's eye for detail to paint vivid word pictures of his predicaments. Mendez possesses a remarkably keen sense of the mechanics of a good cloak-and-dagger story, and fortunately pours it on in abundance here in his quite hefty--and surprisingly lively--autobiography. <i>--Tjames Madison</i></p><p>Tony Mendez is a retired CIA officer who worked undercover for 25 years, participating in some of the most important operations of the Cold War. He earned the CIA's Intelligence Medal of Merit and was chosen as one of 50 officers to be awarded the Trailblazer Medallion.</p> <p>He is an award-winning painter and the author of <em>The Master of Disguise</em> and <em>Spy Dust</em>, which he co-wrote with his wife Jonna Mendez, also a retired intelligence officer. His most recent book is <em>Argo</em>, which tells the story of the operation he ran to rescue six Americans hiding in the Canadian Embassy in Tehran during the hostage crisis. The operation inspired the Warner Brothers feature film of the same name.

But the possibilities of the indoor garden to transform our homes and our lives remain largely unrealized.&nbsp;<br> <br> In this groundbreaking book, Jerome Osentowski, one of North America&#x2019;s most accomplished permaculture designers, presents a wholly new approach to a very old horticultural subject. In <em>The Forest Garden Greenhouse</em>, he shows how bringing the forest garden indoors is not only possible, but doable on unlikely terrain and in cold climates, using near-net-zero technology. Different from other books on greenhouse design and management, this book advocates for an indoor agriculture using permaculture design concepts&#x2015;integration, multi-functions, perennials, and polycultures&#x2015;that take season extension into new and important territory.<br> <br> Osentowski, director and founder of Central Rocky Mountain Permaculture Institute (CRMPI), farms at 7,200 feet on a steep, rocky hillside in Colorado, incorporating deep, holistic permaculture design with practical common sense. It is at this site, high on a mountaintop, where Osentowski (along with architect and design partner Michael Thompson) has been designing and building revolutionary greenhouses that utilize passive and active solar technology via what they call the &#x201c;climate battery&#x201d;&#x2015;a subterranean air-circulation system that takes the hot, moist, ambient air from the greenhouse during the day, stores it in the soil, and discharges it at night&#x2015;that can offer tropical and Mediterranean climates at similarly high altitudes and in cold climates (and everywhere else). Osentowski&#x2019;s greenhouse designs, which can range from the backyard homesteader to commercial greenhouses, are completely ecological and use a simple design that traps hot and cold air and regulates it for best possible use. The book is part case study of the amazing greenhouses at CRMPI and part how-to primer for anyone interested in a more integrated model for growing food and medicine in a greenhouse. With detailed design drawings, photos, and profiles of successful greenhouse projects on all scales, this inspirational manual will considerably change the conversation about greenhouse design.</p></p><p><p>A forager and permaculturist with roots in rural Nebraska, Jerome Osentowski lives in a passive solar home he built at 7200 feet above Colorado&#x2019;s Roaring Fork Valley. Director and founder of Central Rocky Mountain Permaculture Institute and a permaculture designer for thirty years, he has built five greenhouses for himself and scores of others for private clients and public schools in the Rockies and beyond. He makes his living from an intensively cultivated one acre of indoor and outdoor forest garden and plant nursery, which he uses as a backdrop for intensive permaculture and greenhouse design courses. Among his accomplishments is hosting the longest-running Permaculture Design Course in the world, now at twenty-nine years running. Jerome and Michael have also been instrumental in identifying, conserving, and propagating heritage fruit trees that have survived and borne crops for over a century in the harsh environment of the Roaring Fork Valley. Jerome&#x2019;s explorations of sustainable systems and his travels for development projects have taken him to Baja, Nicaragua, Patagonia, Finland, Australia, and the Caribbean.</p><p><strong><em>Publishers Weekly</em>-</strong></p> <p>"Osentowski shows how building and maintaining a Mediterranean or tropical greenhouse full of figs, lemons, papayas, and bananas can be both affordable and practical. Drawing on his 30 years of experimentation and teaching in the harsh, dry mountain environment of his Central Rocky Mountain Permaculture Institute, he offers lush descriptions of his five greenhouses and in-depth, layered advice on designing and constructing a balmy winter retreat. His method uses a 'climate battery&#x2019;&nbsp;consisting of tubes buried underground to collect and hold warm air from the greenhouse, which then recirculate it when the temperature cools, backed up in the coldest days with a pellet or wood stove that can simultaneously heat an attached sauna. Osentowski admits that he prefers a hands-on method of teaching, and his written tours through greenhouses are sometimes hard to follow. Novices may be intimidated by the lack of step-by-step, formulaic instruction. But more experienced gardeners, builders, and tinkerers, and even intrepid beginners willing to carefully observe, compute, and ponder, will find this readable guide jam-packed with enough information and inspiration to help them attempt their own indoor paradises.&#x201d;</p><br><br><p>&#x201c;A grand master of American permaculture, Jerome Osentowski has pioneered school gardens, high-altitude/high-nutrient cropping, bio-islands for organic golf course management, and heritage fruit trees for the mountain West. Of them all, the forest garden greenhouse is the most impressive. A marvel of integration between humans, the built environment, and the natural world, the greenhouse, in a world of climate calamity, will prove indispensable for both home comfort and food production.&nbsp;<em>The Forest Garden Greenhouse</em>&nbsp;surpasses all others on the subject for technical innovation and practical design.&#x201d;<strong>--Peter Bane, author of&nbsp;<em>The Permaculture Handbook: Garden Farming for Town and Country</em>, board member, Permaculture Institute of North America, and former publisher and editor,&nbsp;<em>Permaculture Activist&nbsp;</em>magazine</strong></p><br><br><p>&#x201c;In&nbsp;1997 I had the privilege of visiting Jerome Osentowski&#x2019;s forest garden in Basalt, Colorado. There is no doubt that Jerome learns from nature with enthusiasm and is one of the few with the capacity to translate his observations into a garden that feeds people&#x2015;and dreams.&nbsp;<em>The Forest Garden Greenhouse</em>&nbsp;not only makes you wonder how you could achieve forest gardens at home and in your community, but it also makes you take action without delay! There is a sense of urgency that we transform our resource use; with wisdom gained from experience, Jerome shows us how we can do just that.&#x201d;<strong>--Gunter Pauli, author of&nbsp;<em>The Blue Economy</em></strong></p><br><br><p>&#x201c;This revolutionary book captures what Jerome Osentowski has learned in decades of building and tending his high-altitude food forest and extensive permaculture site. Jerome&#x2019;s climate battery is a brilliant idea deserving a broad audience. It brings greenhouse technology into the twenty-first century using simple, appropriate materials. <em>The Forest Garden Greenhouse</em>&nbsp;clearly and elegantly describes the greenhouse, the garden, and the evolution of Jerome&#x2019;s deep wisdom and creativity. This is much more than a greenhouse book; it&#x2019;s a manifesto and guidebook showing how permaculture can help us live regenerative lives.&#x201d;<strong>--Toby Hemenway, author of&nbsp;<em>The Permaculture City&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Gaia&#x2019;s Garden</em></strong></p><br><br><p>&#x201c;Jerome Osentowski is a master of simple, elegantly frugal, eminently practical indoor gardens that can grow lots of almost anything almost anywhere by not treating soil like dirt.

What is an apprentice? It is a young person who is learning a skill from a master teacher. Our students will serve as apprentices to the great writers and great stories of history.<p> Students are often expected to write with no clear model before them.Modern composition scolds traditional writing instruction as rote and unimaginative.It takes imitation to task for a lack of freedom and personal expression.And yet, effective communication from writer to reader always requires some sort of form and structure.Many of historys greatest writers learned by imitation.In other words, writing takes the same kind of determined study as ballet or diving.Creativity uses conventional form as a stage or a springboard from which to launch grand jetes and somersaults. Too often students are expected to tackle complex writing assignments without learning the necessary intermediate steps.The assumption is that because most everyone can speak English well enough to be understood, and form letters with a pencil, that everyone should be able to write well. Yet how many of us would expect a child to sit at a piano, without piano lessons, and play a concerto?Writing is never automatic. </p><p> The Writing &amp; Rhetoric series method employs fluent reading, careful listening, models for imitation, and progressive steps.It assumes that students learn best by reading excellent, whole-story examples of literature and by growing their skills through imitation. Each exercise is intended to impart a skill (or tool) that can be employed in all kinds of writing and speaking.The exercises are arranged from simple to more complex. Whats more, the exercises are cumulative, meaning that later exercises incorporate the skills acquired in preceding exercises.This series is a step-by-step apprenticeship in the art of writing and rhetoric. </p><p>Fable, the first book in the Writing &amp; Rhetoric series, teaches students the practice of close reading and comprehension, summarizing a story aloud and in writing, and amplification of a story through description and dialogue.Students learn how to identify different kinds of stories;determine the beginning, middle, and end of stories;recognize point of view; and see analogous situations, among other essential tools. The Writing &amp; Rhetoric series recovers a proven method of teaching writing, using fables to teach beginning writers the craft of writing well.This is the first in a series of twelve books that will train students over six years, starting in grades three or four and up. Narrative, the second book of twelve in the Writing &amp; Rhetoric series, uses parable, myth, and other tales to continue the recovery of the proven method of teaching writing, using various forms of narrative to teach beginning writers the craft of writing well.This is the second in a series of twelve books that will train students over six years, starting in grades three or four and up. </p><p>Classical Academic Press </p><p> Educators will find all curricula by Classical Academic Press to be created with four important attributes.

When trying to understand the polarizing contradictions that exist in the Dakotas between "hospitality and insularity, change and inertia, stability and instability.... between hope and despair, between open hearts and closed minds," Norris draws a map. "We are at the point of transition between east and west in the United States," she explains, "geographically and psychically isolated from either coast, and unlike either the Midwest or the desert west."<p> Like Terry Tempest Williams (<i>Refuge</i>), Norris understands how the boundary between inner and outer scenery begins to blur when one is fully present in the landscape of their lives. As a result, she offers the geography lesson we all longed for in school. This is a poetic, noble, and often funny (see her discussion on the foreign concept of tofu) tribute to Dakota, including its Native Americans, Benedictine monks, ministers and churchgoers, wind-weathered farmers, and all its plain folks who live such complicated and simple lives. <i>--Gail Hudson</i></p>Kathleen Norris is the author of two books of poetry, Falling Off (1971) and The Middle of the World (1981) and has received awards from the Guggenheim and Bush foundations.

Unlike most studies, which assume that the "rise of the West" is the story of the coming of the modern world, this history, drawing upon new scholarship on Asia, Africa, and the New World, constructs a story in which those parts of the world play major roles. <br><br>Robert B. Marks defines the modern world as one marked by industry, the nation state, interstate warfare, a large and growing gap between the wealthiest and poorest parts of the world, and an escape from "the biological old regime." He explains its origins by emphasizing contingencies (such as the conquest of the New World); the broad comparability of the most advanced regions in China, India, and Europe; the reasons why England was able to escape from common ecological constraints facing all of those regions by the 18th century; and a conjuncture of human and natural forces that solidified a gap between the industrialized and non-industrialized parts of the world.<br><br>Now in a new edition that brings the saga of the modern world to the present, the book considers how and why the United States emerged as a world power in the twentieth century and became the sole superpower by the twenty-first century. Once again arguing that the rise of the United States to global hegemon was contingent, not inevitable, Marks also points to the resurgence of Asia and the vastly changed relationship of humans to the environment that may, in the long run, overshadow any political and economic milestones of the past hundred years.<br><br></p><p><b>Robert B. Marks</b> is Richard and Billie Deihl Professor of History at Whittier College.Marks is eminently well-qualified to bring Asia to the front of the story about the origins of the modern world. . . . Inspired mostly through the work of Andrï¿½ Gunder Frank and Ken Pomeranz, Marks writes a world history survey that is very useful for locating the place of China and India in the construction of the modern world.<br> (Adrian Carton <i>Education About Asia</i>)<br><br>The Origins of the Modern World aims at the undergraduate student . . . but any teacher who has struggled with the question, 'When did American Civilization begin?' will see other applications. Inexpensive enough to consider as a supplemental reading requirement in a traditional Atlantic History class or even for an American History survey, this well designed textbook will orient students toward broader awareness, both historically and within their own world. (Joe Petrulionis <i>U.S. Intellectual History</i>)<br><br>This is a splendid book that . . . brings together the very latest scholarship to provide a highly readable and erudite account of world history over the last half a millennium. . . . I thus thoroughly recommend this book. (James Beattie, University of Waikato <i>New Zealand Journal of Asian Studies</i>)<br><br>By far the best of the current world history books on the market.

In this highly original book, Jon D. Levenson explores how this notion of child sacrifice constitutes an overlooked bond between the two religions.<br>Levenson argues that although the <i>practice</i> of child sacrifice was eradicated during the late seventh and sixth centuries B.C.E, the <i>idea</i> of sacrificing the first-born son (or the late-born son whose preferential treatment promotes him to that exalted rank) remained potent in religious literature. Analyzing texts from the ancient Near East, the Hebrew Bible, the New Testament, and rabbinic literature, Levenson shows how tales of the son handed over to death by his loving father in the Hebrew Bible influenced the Church's identification of Jesus as sacrificial victim. According to Levenson, the transformation of the idea of child sacrifice was central to the accounts given by the people Israel and the early Church of their respective origins, and it also underlay the theologies of chosenness embraced, in their differing ways, by the two religions. Furthermore, the longstanding claim of the Church that it supersedes the Jews, says Levenson, both continues and transforms elements of the old narrative pattern in which a late-born son dislodges his first-born brothers. Levenson's book, which offers novel interpretations of several areas crucial to biblical studies, will be essential reading for scholars in the field.</p><p>The near-sacrifice and miraculous restoration of a beloved son is a central but largely overlooked theme in both Judaism and Christianity, celebrated in biblical texts on Isaac, Ishmael, Jacob Joseph, and Jesus.

Poet, professor, and scholar Susan Snively has carefully chosen 35 poems of interest to children and their families. Each poem is beautifully illustrated by Christine Davenier and thoroughly explained by an expert. The gentle introduction, which is divided into sections by season of the year, includes commentary, definitions of important words, and a foreword.</p></p><p><p><b>Susan Snively, PhD</b>, is the author of four books of poetry: <i>From This Distance</i> (Alice James, 1981), <i>Voices in the House</i> (Alabama Poetry Series, 1988), <i>The Undertow</i> (University of Central Florida, 1998), and <i>Skeptic Traveler</i> (David Robert Books, 2005). She has taught at Smith College, Mount Holyoke College, and Amherst College and has received fellowships from the NEA and the Massachusetts Artists Foundation. For 27 years, she directed the Writing Center at Amherst College and is the Associate Dean of Students.

A guide at the Emily Dickinson Museum, Snively wrote and narrated the films "Seeing New Englandly," and "My Business is to Sing," produced by Ernest Urvater, in the series "Angles of a Landscape." She regularly leads discussions on various aspects of Dickinson for the museum's monthly poetry group. Her first novel, The Heart Has Many Doors, about Dickinson's love affair with Judge Otis Phillips Lord, was published in February 2015, by White River Press. She lives in Amherst with her husband, Peter Czap.</p><p><b>Christine Davenier</b> worked as a teacher for three years before illustrating her first book in France in 1988. Since 1999, Christine has also been illustrating books in the United States. Her energetic style and exuberant characters have helped her books garner Parents' Choice and Booksense Top Ten awards. In 2002, <i>The First Thing My Mama Told Me</i> (North-South) was chosen as a <i>New York Times</i> Best Illustrated Book. More recently, books in the <i>Very Fairy Princess</i> series (Little, Brown), written by Julie Andrews and Emma Walton Hamilton, have spent several weeks on the New York Times and Publishers Weekly children's bestseller lists. Christine has also illustrated bestsellers by Judith Viorst, Jack Prelutsky, Kimberly Willis Holt, Madeline L'Engle, Peter Yarrow, and Amanda Peet, as well as the Iris and Walter series Miss Lina's Ballerinas series.</p>Gr 3 Up&#x2014;This winning collection pairs 35 poems from Emily Dickinson's canon, arranged by season, with Davenier's rich, expressive artwork. The book opens with a biographical introduction to Dickinson by Snively, who is a guide at the Emily Dickinson Museum. Snively emphasizes Dickinson's fascination with science and the natural world, presenting her as a poet with a life "both quiet and busy"&#x2014;a refreshing characterization. Pen and watercolor illustrations accompany each poem, vividly highlighting its subject while cleverly evoking less tangible imagery. For instance, a child dressed as a juggler leaps gracefully in the air amid spotted colors of gold and purple ("Blazing in gold and quenching in purple," reads the first line of the corresponding untitled poem). The child dances within a circular orb that emulates the sun, helping readers to see the riotous sunset that is alluded to in the rest of the poem. Definitions unobtrusively appear underneath each poem in small italics, as warranted. A helpful index, bibliography, and brief poetry analysis section, "What Emily Was Thinking," are included. Although the title of the poetry analysis is slightly misleading, since no one knows what the poet was thinking when she wrote certain lines, it is a useful guide for independent readers. While there are previously published volumes of Dickinson's work available (Frances Schoonmaker Bolin's Poetry for Young People: Emily Dickinson), this is a far superior selection. VERDICT A beautiful introduction to Dickinson for upper elementary poets.&#x2014;Rachel Zuffa, Racine Public Library, WI</p><h2>The Ultimate Guide to Chakras: The Beginner&#39;s Guide to Balancing, Healing, and Unblocking Your Chakras for Health and Positive Energy (Volume 5) (The Ultimate Guide to..., 5)</h2><p><b>With <i>The Ultimate Guide to Chakras</i>, tune in to your chakras, the power centers connecting your physical body and the world of energy.</b><br><br> Your chakras are the power centers that translate between the seen world of the physical body and the unseen world of energy.

She shows that the clash between nascent Islam and stubburn Byzantium was the central contest that allowed "Europe" to develop, and she thereby places the rise of the West in its true Mediterranean context. Her inquiry centers on the notion of "Christendom." Instead of taking medieval beliefs for granted or separating theology from politics, she treats the faith as a material force. In a path-breaking account of the arguments over Christian doctrine, she shows how the northern sphere of the Roman world divided into two distinct and self-conscious imperial units, as the Arabs swept through the southern regions.</p><br><p> One of the most interesting strands of the author's argument concerns religious art and iconoclasm. Her book shows how the impact of Islam's Judaic ban on graven images precipitated both the iconoclast crisis in Constantinople and the West's unique commitment to pictorial narrative, as justified by Pope Gregory the Great.</p></p><p>Judith Herrin was educated at the Universities of Cambridge and Birmingham. She currently works in the Classics Department of King&#39;s College, London."The main argument of Judith Herrin's <i>The Formation of Christendom</i> is that what she calls the 'initial particularity' of Europe is to be sought in the period between the fourth and the ninth centuries. . . . Herrins's scholarship is unerring, her scope is wide and her style fluent. . . . The treatment of the so-called iconoclastic controversy, the dispute over the veneration of images in Christian worship which convulsed the Byzantine world in the eighth century, is sparkling. . . .

(<i>The Economist</i>)<br><br>"It is [the] binding together of distant past and immediate present which makes Judith Herrin's scholarship so exciting: she can convince the reader that the roots of Western distinctiveness really do lead all the way to forgotten episcopal meetings in small towns in Asia Minor in the fourth century."<b>---Michael Ignatieff, <i>The Observer</i></b><br><br>"This is a serious and powerful book....a grand synthesis on a scale few people would dare now to attempt, ranging across diverse societies with considerable assurance."<b>---Christopher J.

Although he based his work on a long tradition of biographical writing, Vasari infused these literary portraits with a decidedly modern form of critical judgment. The result is a work that remains to this day the cornerstone of art historical scholarship. <br>Spanning the period from the thirteenth century to Vasari&#x2019;s own time, the Lives opens a window on the greatest personalities of the period, including Giotto, Brunelleschi, Mantegna, Leonardo, Raphael, Michelangelo, and Titian. This Modern Library edition, abridged from the original text with notes drawn from earlier commentaries, as well as current research, reminds us why The Lives of the Most Excellent Painters, Sculptors, and Architects is indispensable to any student interested in Renaissance art.</p><p>Philip Jacks, a leading scholar of the Italian Renaissance, is Associate Professor of Fine Arts and Art History at George Washington University and the author of several books. He also edited Vasari&#x2019;s Florence: Artists and Literati at the Medicean Court.Preface to the Lives<br><br> I have no manner of doubt that it is with almost all writers a common and deeply-fixed opinion that sculpture and painting together were first discovered, by the light of nature, by the people of Egypt, and that there are certain others who attribute to the Chaldï¿½ans the first rough sketches in marble and the first reliefs in statuary, even as they also give to the Greeks the invention of the brush and of coloring. But I will surely say that of both one and the other of these arts the design, which is their foundation, nay rather, the very soul that conceives and nourishes within itself all the parts of man&#x2019;s intellect, was already most perfect before the creation of all other things, when the Almighty God, having made the great body of the world and having adorned the heavens with their exceeding bright lights, descended lower with His intellect into the clearness of the air and the solidity of the earth, and, shaping man, discovered, together with the lovely creation of all things, the first form of sculpture; from which man afterwards, step by step (and this may not be denied), as from a true pattern, there were taken statues, sculptures, and the science of pose and of outline; and for the first pictures (whatsoever they were), softness, harmony, and the concord in discord that comes from light and shade. Thus, then, the first model whence there issued the first image of man was a lump of clay, and not without reason, seeing that the Divine Architect of time and of nature, being Himself most perfect, wished to show in the imperfection of the material the way to add and to take away; in the same manner wherein the good sculptors and painters are wont to work, who, adding and taking away in their models, bring their imperfect sketches to that final perfection which they desire. He gave to man that most vivid color of flesh, whence afterwards there were drawn for painting, from the mines of the earth, the colors themselves for the counterfeiting of all those things that are required for pictures. It is true, indeed, that it cannot be affirmed for certain what was made by the men before the Flood in these arts in imitation of so beautiful a work, although it is reasonable to believe that they too carved and painted in every manner; seeing that Belus, son of the proud Nimrod, about 200 years after the Flood, caused to be made that statue wherefrom there was afterwards born idolatry, and his son&#x2019;s wife, the very famous Semiramis, Queen of Babylon, in the building of that city, placed among its adornments not only diverse varied kinds of animals, portrayed and colored from nature, but also the image of herself and of Ninus, her husband, and, moreover, statues in bronze of her husband&#x2019;s father, of her husband&#x2019;s mother, and of the mother of the lat- ter, as Diodorus relates, calling them by the Greek names (that did not yet exist) Jove, Juno, and Ops. From these statues, perchance, the Chaldï¿½ans learned to make the images of their gods, seeing that 150 years later Rachel, in flying from Mesopotamia together with Jacob her husband, stole the idols of Laban her father, as is clearly related in Genesis. Nor, indeed, were the Chaldï¿½ans alone in making sculptures and pictures, but the Egyptians made them also, exercising themselves in these arts with that so great zeal which is shown in the marvelous tomb of the most ancient King Osimandyas, copiously described by Diodorus, and proved by the stern commandment made by Moses in the Exodus from Egypt, namely, that under pain of death there should be made to God no image whatsoever. He, on descending from the mountain, having found the golden calf wrought and adored solemnly by his people, and being greatly perturbed to see Divine honors paid to the image of a beast, not only broke it and reduced it to powder, but for punishment of so great a sin caused many thousands of the wicked sons of Israel to be slain by the Levites. But because not the making of statues but their adoration was a deadly sin, we read in Exodus that the art of design and of statuary, not only in marble but in every kind of metal, was bestowed by the mouth of God on Bezaleel, of the tribe of Judah, and on Aholiab, of the tribe of Dan, who were those that made the two cherubim of gold, the candlesticks, the veil, the borders of the priestly vestments, and so many other most beautiful castings for the Tabernacle, for no other reason than to bring the people to contemplate and to adore them.<br><br> From the things seen before the Flood, then, the pride of men found the way to make the statues of those for whom they wished that they should remain famous and immortal in the world. And the Greeks, who think differently about this origin, say that the Ethiopians invented the first statues, as Diodorus tells; that the Egyptians took them from the Ethiopians, and, from them, the Greeks; for by Homer&#x2019;s time sculpture and painting are seen to have been perfected, as it is proved, in discoursing of the shield of Achilles, by that divine poet, who shows it to us carved and painted, rather than described, with every form of art. Lactantius Firmianus, by way of fable, attributes it to Prometheus, who, in the manner of Almighty God, shaped man&#x2019;s image out of mud; and from him, he declares, the art of statuary came. But according to what Pliny writes, this came to Egypt from Gyges the Lydian, who, being by the fire and gazing at his own shadow, suddenly, with some charcoal in his hand, drew his own outline on the wall. And from that age, for a time, outlines only were wont to be used, with no body of color, as the same Pliny confirms; which method was rediscovered with more labor by Philocles the Egyptian, and likewise by Cleanthes and Ardices of Corinth and by Telephanes of Sicyon.<br><br> Cleophantes of Corinth was the first among the Greeks who used colors, and Apollodorus the first who discovered the brush. There followed Polygnotus of Thasos, Zeuxis, and Timagoras of Chalcis, with Pythias and Aglaophon, all most celebrated; and after these the most famous Apelles, so much esteemed and honored by Alexander the Great for his talent, and the most ingenious investigator of slander and false favor, as Lucian shows us; even as almost all the excellent painters and sculptors were endowed by Heaven, in nearly every case, not only with the adornment of poetry, as may be read of Pacuvius, but with philosophy besides, as may be seen in Metrodorus, who, being as well versed in philosophy as in painting, was sent by the Athenians to Paulus Emilius to adorn his triumph, and remained with him to read philosophy to his sons.<br><br> The art of sculpture, then, was greatly exercised in Greece, and there appeared many excellent craftsmen, and, among others, Pheidias, an Athenian, with Praxiteles and Polycletus, all very great masters, while Lysippus and Pyrgoteles were excellent in sunk reliefs, and Pygmalion in reliefs in ivory, of whom there is a fable that by his prayers he obtained breath and spirit for the figure of a virgin that he made. Painting, likewise, was honored and rewarded by the ancient Greeks and Romans, seeing that to those who made it appear marvelous they showed favor by bestowing on them citizenship and the highest dignities. So greatly did this art flourish in Rome that Fabius gave renown to his house by writing his name under the things so beautifully painted by him in the temple of Salus, and calling himself Fabius Pictor. It was forbidden by public decree that slaves should exercise this art throughout the cities, and so much honor did the nations pay without ceasing to the art and to the craftsmen that the rarest works were sent among the triumphal spoils, as marvelous things, to Rome, and the finest craftsmen were freed from slavery and recompensed with honors and rewards by the commonwealths.<br><br> The Romans themselves bore so great reverence for these arts that besides the respect that Marcellus, in sacking the city of Syracuse, commanded to be paid to a craftsman famous in them, in planning the assault of the aforesaid city they took care not to set fire to that quarter wherein there was a most beautiful painted panel, which was afterwards carried to Rome in the triumph, with much pomp. Thither, having, so to speak, despoiled the world, in course of time they assembled the craftsmen themselves as well as their finest works, wherewith afterwards Rome became so beautiful, for the reason that she gained so great adornment from the statues from abroad more than from her own native ones; it being known that in Rhodes, the city of an island in no way large, there were more than 30,000 statues counted, either in bronze or in marble, nor did the Athenians have less, while those at Olympia and at Delphi were many more and those in Corinth numberless, and all were most beautiful and of the greatest value. Is it not known that Nicomedes, King of Lycia, in his eagerness for a Venus that was by the hand of Praxiteles, spent on it almost all the wealth of his people? Did not Attalus the same, who, in order to possess the picture of Bacchus painted by Aristides, did not scruple to spend on it more than 6,000 sesterces? Which picture was placed by Lucius Mummius in the temple of Ceres with the greatest pomp, in order to adorn Rome.<br><br> But for all that the nobility of these arts was so highly valued, it is none the less not yet known for certain who gave them their first beginning. For, as has been already said above, it appears most ancient among the Chaldï¿½ans, some give it to the Ethiopians, and the Greeks attribute it to themselves; and it may be thought, not without reason, that it is perchance even more ancient among the Etruscans, as our Leon Batista Alberti testifies, whereof we have clear enough proof in the marvelous tomb of Porsena at Chiusi, where, no long time since, there were discovered underground, between the walls of the Labyrinth, some terra-cotta tiles with figures on them in half-relief, so excellent and in so beautiful a manner that it can be easily recognized that the art was not begun precisely at that time, nay rather, by reason of the perfection of these works, that it was much nearer its height than its beginning. To this, moreover, witness is likewise borne by our seeing every day many pieces of those red and black vases of Arezzo, made, as may be judged from the manner, about those times, with the most delicate carvings and small figures and scenes in low-relief, and many small round masks wrought with great subtlety by masters of that age, men most experienced, as is shown by the effect, and most excellent in that art. It may be seen, moreover, by reason of the statues found at Viterbo at the beginning of the pontificate of Alexander VI, that sculpture was in great esteem and in no small perfection among the Etruscans; and although it is not known precisely at what time they were made, it may be reasonably conjectured, both from the manner of the figures and from the style of the tombs and of the buildings, no less than from the inscriptions in those Etruscan letters, that they are most ancient and were made at a time when the affairs of this country were in a good and prosperous state. But what clearer proof of this can be sought? seeing that in our own day&#x2014;that is, in the year 1554&#x2014;there has been found a bronze figure of the Chimï¿½ra of Bellerophon, in making the ditches, fortifications, and walls of Arezzo, from which figure it is recognized that the perfection of that art existed in ancient times among the Etruscans, as may be seen from the Etruscan manner and still more from the letters carved on a paw, about which&#x2014;since they are but few and there is no one now who understands the Etruscan tongue&#x2014;it is conjectured that they may represent the name of the master as well as that of the figure itself, and perchance also the date, according to the use of those times. This figure, by reason of its beauty and antiquity, has been placed in our day by the Lord Duke Cosimo in the hall of the new rooms in his Palace, wherein there have been painted by me the acts of Pope Leo X. And besides this there were found in the same place many small figures in bronze after the same manner, which are in the hands of the said Lord Duke.<br><br> But since the dates of the works of the Greeks, the Ethiopians, and the Chaldï¿½ans are as doubtful as our own, and perhaps more, and by reason of the greater need of founding our judgment about these works on conjectures, which, however, are not so feeble that they are in every way wide of the mark, I believe that I strayed not at all from the truth (and I think that everyone who will consent to consider this question discreetly will judge as I did), when I said above that the origin of these arts was nature herself, and the example or model, the most beautiful fabric of the world, and the master, that divine light infused by special grace into us, which has not only made us superior to the other animals, but, if it be not sin to say it, like to God. And if in our own times it has been seen (as I trust to be able to demonstrate a little later by many examples) that simple children roughly reared in the woods, with their only model in the beautiful pictures and sculptures of nature, and by the vivacity of their wit, have begun by themselves to make designs, how much more may we, nay, must we confidently believe that these primitive men, who, in proportion as they were less distant from their origin and divine creation, were thereby the more perfect and of better intelligence, that they, by themselves, having for guide nature, for master purest intellect, and for exam- ple the so lovely model of the world, gave birth to these most noble arts, and from a small beginning, little by little bettering them, brought them at last to perfection? I do not, indeed, wish to deny that there was one among them who was the first to begin, seeing that I know very well that it must needs be that at some time and from some one man there came the beginning; nor, also, will I deny that it may have been possible that one helped another and taught and opened the way to design, to color, and relief, because I know that our art is all imitation, of nature for the most part, and then, because a man cannot by himself rise so high, of those works that are executed by those whom he judges to be better masters than himself. But I say surely that the wishing to affirm dogmatically who this man or these men were is a thing very perilous to judge, and perchance little necessary to know, provided that we see the true root and origin wherefrom art was born. For since, of the works that are the life and the glory of the craftsmen, the first and step by step the second and the third were lost by reason of time, that consumes all things, and since, for lack of writers at that time, they could not, at least in that way, become known to posterity, their craftsmen as well came to be forgotten. But when once the writers began to make record of things that were before their day, they could not speak of those whereof they had not been able to have information, in a manner that there came to be first with them those of whom the memory had been the last to be lost. Even as the first of the poets, by common consent, is said to be Homer, not because there were none before him, for there were, although not so excellent, which is seen clearly from his own works, but because of these early poets, whatever manner of men they were, all knowledge had been lost quite 2,000 years before. However, leaving behind us this part, as too uncertain by reason of its antiquity, let us come to the clearer matters of their perfection, ruin, and restoration, or rather resurrection, whereof we will be able to discourse on much better grounds.<br><br> I say, then, it being true indeed, that they began late in Rome, if the first figure was, as is said, the image of Ceres made of met...</p><h2>Lorna Doone (Wordsworth Classics)</h2><p>With an Introduction by Dr Pamela Knights, Department of English Studies, Durham University <p> This is the only critical edition of this perennially popular story. Sally Shuttleworth's introduction finds, beneath the idyllic evocation of rural bliss and a tale of love and high adventure, a startling sub-text which rigidly defends Victorian values, and portrays a `manly' hero constantly having to prove his masculinity to himself.</p></p><p>With an Introduction and Notes by Dr Pamela Knights, Department of English Studies, Durham UniversityHistorical romance by R.D. Blackmore, published in 1869. Set in the wilds of Exmoor (northern Devonshire, Eng.) during the late 17th century, the novel concerns the adventurous life of the yeoman John Ridd and his love for Lorna Doone, a beautiful maiden.

Edited by Sharon Louden, the book brought together forty essays by working artists, each sharing their own story of how to sustain a creative practice that contributes to the ongoing dialogue in contemporary art. The book struck a nerve&#x2014;how do artists really <i>make it</i> in the world today? Louden took the book on a sixty-two-stop book tour, selling thousands of copies, and building a movement along the way.<br><br> Now, Louden returns with a sequel: forty more essays from artists who have successfully expanded their practice beyond the studio and become change agents in their communities. There is a misconception that artists are invisible and hidden, but the essays here demonstrate the truth&#x2014;artists make a measurable and innovative economic impact in the non-profit sector, in education, and in corporate environments. <i>The Artist as Culture Producer </i>illustrates how today&#x2019;s contemporary artists add to creative economies through out-of-the-box thinking while also generously contributing to the well-being of others.<br><br> By turns humorous, heartbreaking, and instructive, the testimonies of these forty diverse working artists will inspire and encourage every reader&#x2014;from the art student to the established artist. With a foreword by <i>Hyperallergic</i> cofounder and editor-in-chief Hrag Vartanian, <i>The Artist as Culture Producer</i> is set to make an indelible mark on the art world&#x2014;redefining how we see and support contemporary artists.<br><br> Louden&#x2019;s worldwide book tour begins in March 2017.

Louden has picked&nbsp;artists from the obvious U.S. cities that have a density of museums and galleries, but she&#x2019;s also careful to show us those who have made their life in places like Detroit, Baltimore, San Francisco, and Oregon. Artists need not always be at the center of the art universe to forge&nbsp;a sustainable creative practice. While the measures of what it means to be a successful artist might differ radically for each of the artists included in Louden&#x2019;s book, they are all decentralizing the image of success&#x2014;away from the mainstream picture of going to the most reputable MFA programs, being represented by a mega-gallery, living in an art hub like New York or Los Angeles or London, and living on sales of works to major collections and museums. The book posits that networking and strategizing for success don&#x2019;t always carry&nbsp;the same longterm power that sincere relationships do, and the collective narrative that emerges is one of how these artists&#x2019;&nbsp;plans diverged in the face of feeling the need to respond to their peers and surrounding community.&#x201d; (<i>Glasstire</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;<i>The Artist as Culture Producer</i> contains forty wonderfully plainspoken stories of artistic life.

These intimate essays have a disarming frankness, disclosing the lives of artists from the inside out rather than the outside in. they reveal how social action derives from self-reflection, and such artists turn personal hardships and financial difficulties into new practical models.&#x201d; (Adam D. Weinberg, Alice Pratt Brown Director, Whitney Museum of American Art)<br><br>&#x201c;This fascinating set of essays reminds us that artists are not mysterious figures cloistered in studios but vital cultural contributors working right alongside the rest of us to bring beauty, truth, joy and economic value to a society that needs all of these things more than ever.&#x201d; (Ben White, Chief Economic Correspondent at Politico)<br><br>&#x201c;This book not only demystifies the illusion of what it means to be an artist but also positions the artist as a catalyst for productive change in our contemporary society.

Since the first edition was published in 1986, additional sources of data have become available through the increasing use of computerized records for health-related purposes. Also, a better understanding of the uses and limitations of certain epidemiologic concepts has been gained. Modifications of traditional study designs, including nested case-control studies and case-cohort studies, are now more frequently employed. Biological markers of exposure, disease susceptibility, and disease itself are used in many studies and methods of statistical analysis have been further developed. All of these developments have been considered in writing the Second Edition.<br>The authors cover the full scope of observational studies, describing in detail cohort studies, case-control studies, cross-sectional studies, and epidemic investigation. The use of statistical procedures is described in easy-to-understand terms. Sample size estimation, sampling, measurement, and measurement error are fully discussed. Each chapter in the second edition has been updated and several chapters have been expanded. Chapter 3, which summarizes sources of data on disease occurrence, includes several additional sources of data. Chapter 5, which describes modifications of traditional study designs, now contains nested case-control and case-cohort studies. Chapter 15, on other types of measurement, has been expanded to include sections on measurement in epidemiologic studies of the elderly and on biological markers since these have become major areas of epidemiologic research in recent years. Much of the material in Chapters 6, 7, and 9 on the analysis of data from epidemiologic studies is also new to this edition.<br>Perhaps the greatest challenge for the authors in writing this Second Edition was to make some of the modern, frequently used methods of statistical analysis understandable to readers with a limited mathematical or statistical background. Although this book is intended for readers who have had introductory courses in epidemiology and biostatistics, even readers who do not fully comprehend the theory behind some of the techniques should understand the rationale for their use and be able to interpret results when they appear on a computer printout or in the literature. The Second Edition of this widely used text will serve as a practical resource for students and practitioners of epidemiology, public health and biostatistics.<br></p><p>J. L. Kelsey is at Columbia University School of Public Health.<br>From reviews of the first edition: "A much-needed, descriptive, informative, comprehensive, and up-to-date guide to the many theoretical facts as well as the important practical applications of observational epidemiology.

Now, Selig continues the "Teachings&nbsp; of Mastery" with the widely anticipated second volume in his new series: <i>The Book of Truth.</i><b><br></b></p><p>In his breakthrough works of channeled literature, author and medium <b>Paul Selig </b>has recorded an extraordinary program for personal and planetary evolution. Selig was born in New York City and received his master's degree from Yale. He had a spiritual experience in 1987 that left him clairvoyant. As a way to gain a context for what he was beginning to experience, he studied a form of energy healing, working at Marianne Williamson's Manhattan Center for Living and in his own private practice. In the process, he began to "hear" for his clients, and much of Selig's work now is as a clairaudient, clairvoyant, channel, and empath. Selig has led channeled energy groups for many years. Recently featured on ABC's Nightline, he is the subject of the short documentary film Paul &amp; the Word, and is also featured on the A&amp;E/Biography channel series The UneXplained. He often appears on Coast to Coast AM with George Noory. Paul's recent and upcoming workshops include The Kripalu Center in Stockbridge, Massachusetts, The Omega Institute in Rhinebeck, New York, and the Esalen Institute in Big Sur, California. Also a noted playwright and educator, Paul serves on the faculty of NYU and directs the MFA in creative writing program at Goddard College.

Underline the word <i>as</i>. When you operate <i>as </i>truth, you are not in alliance with fear. <br> &nbsp;<br> Understand this, friends. The action of fear, as we have said many times, is to claim more fear, and a world made of fear is a world made of lies. As you align to truth as who and what you are, the being that you are imprints itself in the highest frequency that it may align to, and the acclimation to the imprinting is a resolute self as truth. And as truth, the one that you are steps forward to liberate a world.<br> &nbsp;<br> Now, if you can understand this principle, the remainder of this text will fall into place for you with rapidity. What is in truth cannot be in agreement to a lie. What is in truth will not be in agreement and could never be in agreement to a lie.<br> &nbsp;<br> So the system that you are in, this imprinting&#x2014;and by &#x201c;imprinting&#x201d; we mean encoding the field you have as what you truly are as an aspect of the Creator in form in agreement to be as truth&#x2014;all things you witness must cohere to this vibration.<br> &nbsp;<br> What actually happens to each man and woman who makes this agreement is that they are appropriated by the True Self. And as the True Self, they actually witness a new world that they claim into being through their perception in truth. When what is in truth witnesses what we would call a lie, the action of fear that would seek to invest itself in all you do, cannot be. And by &#x201c;cannot be&#x201d; we mean you have lifted above it to a level where there is no coresonance. <br> &nbsp;<br> We&#x2019;ve discussed this prior and we will continue to do it here. There is nothing that you can see, nothing in your landscape, nothing in the world before you that you are not in agreement to. Now this is not a convenient truth. &#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t create the war. I didn&#x2019;t cause the famine.&#x201d; You are all so busy looking at your lives and the out-picturing of the small self that you cannot see where you are contributing to the action of the whole. And we will tell you this: If you are in witness to it, you are in collective agreement to it. All mankind is in witness to a world and all mankind imprints its consciousness upon what it sees. As mankind witnesses anything, he claims form, he has names for things, and the names he has given things are standing before you as you witness them.<br> &nbsp;<br> Now when we speak of coresonance, we very simply mean that the requirement of being as a resonant self is that you call things to you that you are agreeing to. Everything you see before you, high and low and in between, can only be present in your world through conscious agreement, or perhaps, as Paul says, unconscious, because we are not intending.<br> &nbsp;<br> Now we will explain this. When you see something on the other side of the ocean, you are investing it with your consciousness. You know what it is, what to call it. You can make up a name if you wish. But the thing on the other side of the ocean is in accord with you simply by nature of the fact that you perceive it. The perceiver and the object, whatever the object is, or thing is, and wherever it may be, is always in coresonance with the one that perceives it. <br> &nbsp;<br> As a collective group witnesses anything, decides what it is or means, the collective group invests that very thing with the properties it assumes it should have. And as you have done this in many ways, you are acclimating your own vibration to the object in the way that you&#x2019;ve decided it is. When you witness something as the small self, what you witness is invested with the historical data that you perceive with. &#x201c;My mother told me this was that. I saw this or that in a book, so it must be this or that.&#x201d; And the replication of history in all you see before you is what is going to be attended<br> to in this text. <br> &nbsp;<br> Until human beings realize that they are creators and not living in historical data that must be remade every day as it has been, they will not realize that what can be claimed in new ways will be of greater benefit. <br> &nbsp;<br> Now as you are operating as truth, what you witness must move into accord with that agreement. The one who says, &#x201c;I know who I am in truth,&#x201d; is aligning as truth, and how he witnesses, how she perceives, will be in truth. However, we will say you will not be as truth as long as you continue to act as appropriations of history, emblemizing everything you see as you have been taught that they are, even if what you were taught is incorrect. <br> &nbsp;<br> As we teach you in this text, we will work with a dismantling of structures that were created by man in order to lift man to the potential that she may hold as the creator of a new world. Now hear these words: Because you perceive something, because you witness it before you, you are in agreement to its being. When something is in agreement with you, it is in coresonance with you, or accord, a-c-c-o-r-d or a c-h-o-r-d as on a piano. The instrument you are plays the note that corresponds in vibration to what she sees. And in coresonance you are in relation to the landscape you exist in. <br> <b>&nbsp;</b><br> If you will understand this concept, that you are not distinct from the landscape you inhabit but are actually the perceiver and cocreator with all you see, you will understand the magnitude of this teaching. How all of you decide to be in relation to a world has claimed the world you have. But as you&#x2019;ve been operating in fear, in a belief in your separation not only from your fellows but from the world you exist in, as you have been independent beings seeking to get your needs met as a small self who does not know her Source, you have agreed to a world in fear. <br> &nbsp;<br> Now understand this, friends. As the one who knows herself as truth, one becomes a light that illumines the darkness. And if you wish to say the light as truth and darkness as the lie, you would be accurate. <br> &nbsp;<br> Imagine, if you would, that you walk into a room that was invested in yesterday&#x2019;s history. You don&#x2019;t deny the truth of yesterday. It happened as it was. Things were created in form to meet yesterday&#x2019;s needs. But as the one in truth, your very being and ability to witness actually transforms the material realm. <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;How can this be so?&#x201d; Paul asks. We will answer. By nature of your being. As a coresonant being you cannot be in agreement with a lie. And as you can&#x2019;t be in agreement with a lie, the lie itself, the thing created in fear, must be recognized for what it is and known in a higher way.<br> &nbsp;<br> When something is known in a higher way&#x2014;underline the word <i>known</i>&#x2014;that very thing is lifted to its true nature. If you can imagine that the shell of a pea, the structure that holds the peas in a pod, is disassembled, what is inside the pod may be seen for what it is. And there was nothing that was created in fear, not anything that you can imagine, that wasn&#x2019;t created in an identity born in lower nature. <br> &nbsp;<br> The construct of war is not holy. It&#x2019;s a man-made idea. And as you perceive holiness, which we would call truth, in <i>anything</i>, that thing that was made in fear will be lifted and made new.<br> &nbsp;<br> Now Paul is asking, &#x201c;But is this real? Do we look at a war and create peace?&#x201d; That is not what you are doing. You are witnessing the world before you with new eyes in alignment with the frequency of truth. And by your being, the consciousness you hold cannot agree to what is in fear. And the one who sees the truth in anything calls the light to it. And it is the light that lifts it to its true nature.<br> &nbsp;<br> Stop thinking that your hands do the work here, that it is an act of will that will transform this plane from war to peace. The only thing that will transform this plane from war to peace is a level of consciousness that cannot adhere to war.<br> &nbsp;<br> There is no way that mankind, through effort and force of will, will change its small nature and investments in fear. The small self or personality structure does not fix itself. It is the Divine Self, as and through you, appropriating its world to its true nature that calls the Kingdom into manifestation. And the Kingdom again, the awareness of the Creator in all things, already exists but is only perceived by one who knows who she truly is.<br> &nbsp;<br> Now the masquerade you are all engaging in here, the belief that you are small, that you will not be met on this journey by us, by the light that you truly are and is in all things, the belief that you have that alchemy and transformation are not true, actually limit you to a level of coherence in manifestation that operates in consort with fear. And we will explain why.<br> &nbsp;<br> Imagine for a moment that you were taught that there was another continent, another world on the other side of the ocean, but you cannot imagine it because the plane you see before you has edges. You walk in any direction and there is only the sea. You cannot imagine that there is another way of being beyond the ocean that stretches out forever.<br> &nbsp;<br> Now if you could understand that the belief that there could be nothing else there would keep you tethered to the land mass you are on and not aligning to what could be beyond it, you would never discover a new world. Well, the new world we teach is the Kingdom, and the Kingdom of heaven is here as you claim it. And as all of you claim it, &#x201c;I am here, I am here, I am here,&#x201d; the True Self that I am in the claim &#x201c;I am here,&#x201d; who manifests the Kingdom, knows itself in a new world and that new world is born in consciousness. <br> &nbsp;<br> Now here we go, friends. If you would like to say this with us, you may, but our intention here is that each of you who read this text will be imprinting yourselves in the alignment to truth as your days go on. What you must understand, that truth is a vibration, and aligning as it&#x2014;which means you are as and with it, informed and being as it&#x2014;is the work that we do with each of you. Here are the words we will speak on your behalf:<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;The ones we see before us, in awareness or unawareness of what they truly are, the Divine Beings that they truly are, are stepping forward to be claimed in resonance with truth. And as they agree to this, they are called forth to align to the higher nature of all things made manifest. As they lift their world, their world is healed. As their world is healed, the celebration echoes throughout the atmosphere to all nature, to all things, into infinity. We know who you are in truth. We know what you are in truth. We know how you serve in truth.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> Now the nature of your beings, habituated natures we should say, is what has been. You know yourself through yesterday&#x2019;s clothing, what you saw on the television, where you went to market. You know yourself through your creations, those things that you have made in form. So what we will do next is actually an exercise in re-creation. <br> &nbsp;<br> Imagine that everything you see before you, everything in the room you stand in that was named by someone else&#x2014;that lamp, that chair, the rug beneath my feet&#x2014;imagine everything you see had no name, and with no name it simply is. <br> &nbsp;<br> Now imagine that thing that has no name holds no history. The usage of these things has not been described to you because you need nothing from the landscape except to be.<br> &nbsp;<br> Now as you agree to this, you are actually deconstructing the history of the world that you see before you in your room. You are not denying what is there. You are simply leaving behind the names that have been claimed for them, for those things you see, so that you may claim yourself outside of history. By claiming oneself outside of history, one is actually claiming the True Self because the True Self exists outside of time.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Now if it exists outside of time,&#x201d; Paul asks, &#x201c;how can we be this? We exist in time.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> You exist in an agreement to know your reality in a sequence you call time. But the true nature of your being, while it informs your present self in linear time, also exists beyond it. So what is true is always true regardless of the time you stand in. It is always true on this day that you are reading this page in the text. A million years from now it will still be true that at this moment in time you are hearing these words, seeing these words on the page, and knowing what you think of them.<br> &nbsp;<br> But the true nature of your being, the Infinite Self as we claim it, knows itself beyond structure. And aligning to that energy, the manifested self as you in form now is the Creator serving in perfect ways as you in the life that you are living.<br> &nbsp;<br> So back to the room. Everything was claimed by you with a name, then with no name. Now imagine, if you would, that everything in the room is in vibration. Everything is moving, and as it moves the shapes it&#x2019;s held may become transformed. The wood on the table may be claimed as a tree. The bricks on the wall may be made back to earth. Everything that is in form now was once another form. Do you comprehend this? And because it was once another form, it can be claimed anew and transformed again. Underline this, please. <i>Everything that has been created can be re-created. </i>Everything that&#x2019;s been created can be re-created in its true nature.<br> &nbsp;<br> Now know this to be so. Everything you see before you that is of God cannot be outside of God. And what you put outside of God claims you outside of the light you truly are. As we have said many times, God is all things, so there is nothing that can be outside of God but your belief in separation. Your own separation, the separation from you and your fellows, supports the agreement in separation that you perceive yourself as holding. So when you know who you are&#x2014;&#x201c;I am a Divine Being&#x201d;&#x2014;you claim a world in agreement to that. And when you know what you are&#x2014;underline the word <i>what</i>&#x2014;the manifested self, the Divine Self in form, the world that you see before you may also be known in congruence.<br> &nbsp;<br> If you&#x2019;ve excluded God from the physical realm and placed it upon a cloud somewhere unreachable, you have affirmed separation. But when God is the tree, and the rug beneath your feet, and the man you see across the way, and in all those people over there that don&#x2019;t do what you want, you will begin to understand truth.<br> &nbsp;<br> And that will be the name of this chapter: &#x201c;Understanding Truth.&#x201d; And we will say this for Paul, who has been questioning. We are including last night&#x2019;s lecture as this chapter begins.<br> &nbsp;<br> Now as we continue this teaching, we have several mandates for the dictation. We would prefer to operate in lengthier sessions than you have agreed to thus far. The teachings will come quickly and the regimentation of daily teachings, as they can occur, will support the man in the chair in being a clear receiver for the ongoing message.<br> &nbsp;<br> We will also be pleased to complete this text so that we may be moving forward to th...</p><h2>No Greater Love: Experiencing the Heart of Jesus through the Gospel of John</h2><p>God came in the flesh to show us what love looks like.

This chapter presents a rich and varied selection of literature, including poems and stories. You will also read brief discussions of grammar and writing and explanations of common sayings and phrases.<br><br> By the end of fourth grade, students should be able to engage in the mental process of turning letters into sounds automatically. This year, they will focus more on meaning as they read, extending their vocabulary and understanding of the texts. Asking questions is a good way to draw your children into a story. Here are a few that work well:<br><br> &#x201c;What do you think is going to happen next?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;How might the story have turned out differently if . . . ?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;What did you hear/read that makes you believe that . . . ?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;What does the author mean by the statement . . . ?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;How is this story similar to . . . ?&#x201d;<br><br> You might also ask your child to retell the story. You can even encourage your child to change events or characters: this is a rich tradition of storytelling and explains why there are so many versions of traditional stories.<br><br> You may also encourage your child to write and illustrate her own stories. Some children may be interested in beginning to keep a journal or writing letters to friends or relatives&#x2014;these are both fine ways for children to cultivate their writing skills. Another way to build vocabulary and foster language skills is by playing word games such as Scrabble, Boggle, or hangman and doing crossword puzzles. You can download many of these popular word games on tablet devices and computers.<br><br> Experts say our children already know more about grammar than we can ever teach them. But standard written language does have special characteristics that children need to learn. The treatment of grammar and language conventions in this book is an overview. It needs to be supplemented and rounded out by giving your child opportunities to read and write and to discuss reading and writing in connection with grammar and spelling.<br><br> At school, children should be working on vocabulary and spelling in the fourth grade. They should enjoy a rich diet of fiction, poetry, drama, biography, and nonfiction. They should be involved in the writing process, inventing topics, discovering ideas in early drafts, and revising toward &#x201c;publication&#x201d; of polished final drafts&#x2014;all with encouragement and guidance along the way. They should practice writing in many modes, including stories, poetry, journal entries, formal reports, dialogues, and descriptions.<br><br> For some children, the section on sayings and phrases may not be needed; they will have picked up these sayings by hearing them in everyday speech. But this section will be useful for children from homes where American English is not spoken.<br><br> For additional resources to use in conjunction with this section, visit the Core Knowledge Foundation&#x2019;s website at www.coreknowledge.org.<br><br> Literature<br><br> Introduction<br><br> This selection of poetry, stories, and myths can, in most cases, be read independently by fourth graders. We hope you&#x2019;ll take this as a starting point in your search for more literature for your child to read and enjoy.<br><br> We have included both poetry and prose. The best way to help children appreciate the spirit of poetry is to read it aloud to them and encourage them to speak it aloud so that they can experience the music in the words. Until children take pleasure in the sound of poetry, there is little reason to analyze it technically.<br><br> Most of the stories in this book are either excerpts from longer works or abridged versions of those works. If a child enjoys a particular story, he should be encouraged to read a longer version. Several of the novels excerpted here are available in child-friendly versions as part of the Core Knowledge Foundation&#x2019;s Core Classics series, available for purchase through the foundation&#x2019;s website, www.coreknowledge.org.<br><br> This book continues the effort, begun in previous books, to allow you to coordinate readings about literature and other subjects, including history, visual arts, music, and science. These stories and poems also give you the opportunity to discuss the value of virtues, such as friendship, courage, and honesty, with your child.<br><br> Poetry<br><br> Monday&#x2019;s Child Is Fair of Face<br><br> (author unknown)<br><br> Monday&#x2019;s child is fair of face,<br><br> Tuesday&#x2019;s child is full of grace,<br><br> Wednesday&#x2019;s child is full of woe,<br><br> Thursday&#x2019;s child has far to go,<br><br> Friday&#x2019;s child is loving and giving,<br><br> Saturday&#x2019;s child works hard for a living,<br><br> But the child that is born on the Sabbath day<br><br> Is fair and wise and good and gay.<br><br> Humanity<br><br> by Elma Stuckey<br><br> If I am blind and need someone<br><br> To keep me safe from harm,<br><br> It matters not the race to me<br><br> Of the one who takes my arm.<br><br> If I am saved from drowning<br><br> As I grasp and grope,<br><br> I will not stop to see the face<br><br> Of the one who throws the rope.<br><br> Or if out on some battlefield<br><br> I&#x2019;m falling faint and weak,<br><br> The one who gently lifts me up<br><br> May any language speak.<br><br> We sip the water clear and cool,<br><br> No matter the hand that gives it.<br><br> A life that&#x2019;s lived worthwhile and fine,<br><br> What matters the one who lives it?<br><br> Fog<br><br> by Carl Sandburg<br><br> The fog comes<br><br> on little cat feet.<br><br> It sits looking<br><br> over harbor and city<br><br> on silent haunches<br><br> and then moves on.<br><br> Clouds<br><br> by Christina G.

Ranging freely across the centuries and the Canada&#x2013;U.S. border, King debunks fabricated stories of Indian savagery and White heroism, takes an oblique look at Indians (and cowboys) in film and popular culture, wrestles with the history of Native American resistance and his own experiences as a Native rights activist, and articulates a profound, revolutionary understanding of the cumulative effects of ever-shifting laws and treaties on Native peoples and lands.</p><p>Suffused with wit, anger, perception, and wisdom, <i>The Inconvenient Indian</i> is at once an engaging chronicle and a devastating subversion of history, insightfully distilling what it means to be &#x201c;Indian&#x201d; in North America. It is a critical and personal meditation that sees Native American history not as a straight line but rather as a circle in which the same absurd, tragic dynamics are played out over and over again. At the heart of the dysfunctional relationship between Indians and Whites, King writes, is land: &#x201c;The issue has always been land.&#x201d; With that insight, the history inflicted on the indigenous peoples of North America&#x2014;broken treaties, forced removals, genocidal violence, and racist stereotypes&#x2014;sharpens into focus. Both timeless and timely, <i>The Inconvenient Indian</i> ultimately rejects the pessimism and cynicism with which Natives and Whites regard one another to chart a new and just way forward for Indians and non-Indians alike.<br></p></p><p><p>Thomas King is one of Canada&#x2019;s premier Native public intellectuals. He was the first Aboriginal person to deliver the prestigious Massey Lectures, and he is the best-selling, award-winning author of six novels, two collections of short stories, and two nonfiction books.&nbsp;<i>The Inconvenient Indian</i>&nbsp;won the BC National Award for Canadian Non-Fiction and the RBC Taylor Prize. He is a recipient of the Order of Canada and lives in Guelph, Ontario.</p>About fifteen years back, a bunch of us got together to form a drum group. John Samosi, one of our lead singers, suggested we call ourselves &#x201c;The Pesky Redskins.&#x201d; Since we couldn&#x2019;t sing all that well, John argued, we needed a name that would make people smile and encourage them to overlook our musical deficiencies.<br><br>We eventually settled on the Waa-Chi-Waasa Singers, which was a more stately name. Sandy Benson came up with it, and as I remember, waa-chi-waasa is Ojibway for &#x201c;far away.&#x201d; Appropriate enough, since most of the boys who sit around the drum here in Guelph, Ontario, come from somewhere other than here. John&#x2019;s from Saskatoon. Sandy calls Rama home. Harold Rice was raised on the coast of British Columbia. Mike Duke&#x2019;s home community is near London, Ontario. James Gordon is originally from Toronto. I hail from California&#x2019;s central valley, while my son Benjamin was born in Lethbridge, Alberta, and was dragged around North America with his older brother and younger sister. I don&#x2019;t know<br>where he considers home to be.<br><br>Anishinaabe, Mï¿½tis, Coastal Salish, Cree, Cherokee. We have nothing much in common. We&#x2019;re all Aboriginal and we have the drum. That&#x2019;s about it.<br><br>I had forgotten about &#x201c;Pesky Redskins&#x201d; but it must have been kicking around in my brain because, when I went looking for a title for this book, something with a bit of irony to it, there it was.<br><br><i>Pesky Redskins: A Curious History of Indians in North America.</i><br><br>Problem was, no one else liked the title. Several people I trust told me that Pesky Redskins sounded too flip and, in the end, I had to agree. Native people haven&#x2019;t been so much pesky as we&#x2019;ve been . . . inconvenient.<br><br>So I changed the title to <i>The Inconvenient Indian: A Curious History of Native People in North America</i>, at which point my partner, Helen Hoy, who teaches English at the University of Guelph, weighed in, cautioning that &#x201c;history&#x201d; might be too grand a word for what I was attempting. Benjamin, who is finishing a Ph.D. in History at Stanford, agreed with his mother and pointed out that if I was going to call the book a history, I would be obliged to pay attention to the demands of scholarship and work within an organized and clearly delineated chronology.<br><br>Now, it&#x2019;s not that I think such things as chronologies are a bad idea, but I&#x2019;m somewhat attached to the Ezra Pound School of History. While not subscribing to his political beliefs, I do agree with Pound that &#x201c;We do NOT know the past in chronological sequence. It may be convenient to lay it out anesthetized on the table with dates pasted on here and there, but what we know we know by ripples and spirals eddying out from us and from our own time.&#x201d;<br><br>There&#x2019;s nothing like a good quotation to help a body escape an onerous task. So I tweaked the title one more time, swapped the word &#x201c;history&#x201d; for &#x201c;account,&#x201d; and settled on <i>The Inconvenient Indian: A Curious Account of Native People in North America</i>. Mind you, there<br>is a great deal in <i>The Inconvenient Indian</i> that <i>is</i> history. I&#x2019;m just not the historian you had in mind. While it might not show immediately, I have a great deal of respect for the discipline of history. I studied history as part of my doctoral work in English and American Studies at the University of Utah. I even worked at the American West Center on that campus when Floyd O&#x2019;Neil and S. Lyman Tyler ran the show, and, over the years, I&#x2019;ve met and talked with other historians such as Brian Dippie, Richard White, Patricia Limerick, Jean O&#x2019;Brien, Vine Deloria, Jr., Francis Paul Prucha, David Edmunds, Olive Dickason, Jace Weaver, Donald Smith, Alvin Josephy, Ken Coates, and Arrel Morgan Gibson, and we&#x2019;ve had some very stimulating conversations about . . . history. And in consideration of those conversations and the respect that I have for history, I&#x2019;ve salted my narrative with those things we call facts, even though we should know by now that facts will not save us.<br>Truth be known, I prefer fiction. I dislike the way facts try to thrust themselves upon me. I&#x2019;d rather make up my own world. Fictions are less unruly than histories. The beginnings are more engaging, the characters more co-operative, the endings more in line with expectations of morality and justice. This is not to imply that fiction is exciting and that history is boring. Historical narratives can be as enchanting as a Stephen Leacock satire or as terrifying as a Stephen King thriller.<br><br>Still, for me at least, writing a novel is buttering warm toast, while writing a history is herding porcupines with your elbows.<br><br>As a result, although The Inconvenient Indian is fraught with history, the underlying narrative is a series of conversations and arguments that I&#x2019;ve been having with myself and others for most of my adult life, and if there is any methodology in my approach to the subject, it draws more on storytelling techniques than historiography. A good historian would have tried to keep biases under control. A good historian would have tried to keep personal anecdotes<br>in check. A good historian would have provided footnotes.<br><br>I have not.<br><br>And, while I&#x2019;m making excuses, I suppose I should also apologize if my views cause anyone undue distress. But I hope we can agree that any discussion of Indians in North America is likely to conjure up a certain amount of rage. And sorrow. Along with moments of irony and humour.<br><br>When I was a kid, Indians were Indians. Sometimes Indians were Mohawks or Cherokees or Crees or Blackfoot or Tlingits or Seminoles. But mostly they were Indians. Columbus gets blamed for the term, but he wasn&#x2019;t being malicious. He was looking for India and thought he had found it. He was mistaken, of course, and as time went on, various folks and institutions tried to make the matter right. Indians became Amerindians and Aboriginals and Indigenous People and American Indians. Lately, Indians have become First Nations in Canada and Native Americans in the United States, but the fact of the matter is that there has never<br>been a good collective noun because there never was a collective to begin with.<br><br>I&#x2019;m not going to try to argue for a single word. I don&#x2019;t see that one term is much better or worse than another. &#x201c;First Nations&#x201d; is the current term of choice in Canada, while &#x201c;Native Americans&#x201d; is the fashionable preference in the United States. I&#x2019;m fond of both of these terms, but, for all its faults and problems&#x2014;especially in Canada&#x2014;&#x201c;Indian,&#x201d; as a general designation, remains for me, at least, the North American default.<br><br>Since I&#x2019;m on the subject of terminology and names, I should mention the Mï¿½tis. The Mï¿½tis are one of Canada&#x2019;s three official Aboriginal groups, Indians (First Nations) and the Inuit being the other two. The Mï¿½tis are mixed-bloods, Indian and English, Indian and French, for the most part. They don&#x2019;t have Status under the Indian Act, but they do have designated settlements and homelands in Ontario, Manitoba, Saskatchewan, and Alberta. Many of these communities maintain a separate culture from their White and First Nations neighbours, as well as a separate language&#x2014;Michif&#x2014;which features components of French and Aboriginal languages.<br><br>Terminology is always a rascal. I&#x2019;ve tried to use &#x201c;reservations&#x201d; for Native communities in the United States and &#x201c;reserves&#x201d; for Native communities in Canada, and &#x201c;tribes&#x201d; for Native groups in the United States and &#x201c;bands&#x201d; for Native groups in Canada. But in a number of instances, when I&#x2019;m talking about both sides of the border, I might use &#x201c;reservation&#x201d; or &#x201c;reserve&#x201d; and &#x201c;band&#x201d; or &#x201c;tribe&#x201d; or &#x201c;Nation,&#x201d; depending on rhythm and syntax. I actually prefer &#x201c;Nation&#x201d; or a specific band or tribal name, and I try to use this whenever possible.<br><br>And Whites. Well, I struggled with this one. A Japanese friend of mine likes to call Anglos &#x201c;crazy Caucasoids,&#x201d; while another friend told me that if I was going to use the term &#x201c;Indians&#x201d; I should call everyone else &#x201c;cowboys.&#x201d; Both of these possibilities are fun, but there are limits to satire. Besides, &#x201c;Whites&#x201d; is a perfectly serviceable term. Native people have been using it for years, sometimes as a description and sometimes as something else. Let&#x2019;s agree that within the confines of this book the term is neutral and refers to a general group of people as diverse and indefinable as &#x201c;Indians.&#x201d;<br><br>There is an error in the text of the book that I have not corrected. &#x201c;The Bureau of Indian Affairs&#x201d; is the correct designation for the U.S. agency that is charged with looking after matters pertaining to Indians in that country, but for Canada, I have continued to use the &#x201c;Department of Indian Affairs&#x201d; even though the ministry is now called &#x201c;Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development Canada.&#x201d; I simply like the older name and find it less disingenuous.<br><br>In the end, I&#x2019;m not so much concerned with designing a strict vocabulary as I am with crafting a coherent and readable narrative.<br><br>One of the difficulties with trying to contain any account of Indians in North America in a volume as modest as this is that it can&#x2019;t be done. Perhaps I should have called the book <i>The&nbsp; Inconvenient Indian: An Incomplete Account of Indians in North America</i>. For whatever<br>I&#x2019;ve included in this book, I&#x2019;ve left a great deal more out. I don&#x2019;t talk about European explorers and their early relationships with&nbsp; Native people. I haven&#x2019;t written much about the Mï¿½tis in Canada and, with the exception of the Nunavut Land Claims Agreement, I don&#x2019;t deal with the Inuit at all. I touch on early settlement and conflicts, but only in passing. I spend a great deal of time on Native people and film, because film, in all its forms, has been the only<br>place where most North Americans have seen Indians. I talk about some of the resistance organizations and the moments that marked them, but I don&#x2019;t spend any time on Anna Mae Aquash&#x2019;s murder or on the travesty of Leonard Peltier&#x2019;s trial and imprisonment.<br><br>Nor do I talk about Native women such as Brenda Wolfe, Georgina Papin, and Mona Wilson, women whom Robert &#x201c;Willie&#x201d; Pickton murdered at his pig farm in British Columbia, or the Native women who have gone missing in Vancouver and along the highway between Prince Rupert and Prince George. Nor do I bring up the murder of Ditidaht First Nation carver<br>John T. Williams, who, in 2010, was gunned down in Seattle by a trigger-happy cop.<br><br>While I spend time in the distant and the immediate past, I&#x2019;ve also pushed the narrative into the present in order to consider contemporary people and events. This probably isn&#x2019;t the best idea. The present tends to be too fresh and fluid to hold with any surety. Still, as I argue in the book, when we look at Native&#x2013;non-Native relations, there is no great difference between the past and the present. While we have dispensed with guns and bugles, and while North America&#x2019;s sense of its own superiority is better hidden, its disdain muted, twenty-first-century attitudes towards Native people are remarkably similar to those of the previous centuries. Finally, no doubt, someone will wonder why I decided to take on both Canada and the United States at the same time, when choosing one or the other would have made for a less involved and more focused conversation. The answer to this is somewhat complicated by perspective. While the line that divides the two countries is a political reality, and while the border affects bandsand tribes in a variety of ways, I would have found it impossible<br>to talk about the one without talking about the other.<br><br>For most Aboriginal people, that line doesn&#x2019;t exist. It&#x2019;s a figment of someone else&#x2019;s&nbsp; imagination. Historical figures such as Chief Joseph and Sitting Bull and Louis Riel moved back and forth between the two countries, and while they understood the importance of that border to Whites, there is nothing to indicate that they believed in its legitimacy.<br><br>I get stopped every time I try to cross that border, but stories go wherever they please.</p><h2>The Koehler Method of Training Tracking Dogs</h2><p>For search and rescue work, to assist in law enforcement, and to compete in Tracking Tests, here is all the preparation you and your dog will need.</p><p></p><h2>Mr. Boston: Official Bartender&#39;s and Party Guide</h2><p>The up-to-date new edition of America's bestselling drink-mixing guide<br> <br> America's favorite drink-mixing guide since 1935, Mr. Boston: Official Bartender's and Party Guide has been the resource of choice for generations of professionals and amateurs alike.

It expands the fourth edition's coverage of computer-related research methods and employs an international perspective, presenting general principles and their practical applications. Like previous editions, <em>A Practical Guide to Behavioral Research, 5/e,</em> covers the four major approaches to behavioral research (experimentation, observation, questionnaire, interview) and examines other important methods, including attitude and rating scales, the case study, semantic differential, unobtrusive measures, and the use of personal documents. It provides particularly strong treatment of observational approaches, behavior and cognitive mapping, electronic searches and Internet research, and action research. This revision includes two new chapters stimulated by student interest: Chapter 14, "Action Research," addresses the gap between doing research and having it applied; Chapter 15, "The Big Fuzzies," describes techniques for researching important concepts that are difficult to define and measure.<br>Written in an accessible, colloquial style, this popular book encourages students to actually <em>do</em> research instead of just learning the concepts and language. Clear descriptions and concrete examples of abstract concepts demystify research and help students think about research procedures in a variety of settings, not just in the laboratory. Ideal for undergraduates in research methods classes, <em>A Practical Guide to Behavioral Research, 5/e,</em> is an invaluable reference for students of communications, education, nursing, design, and business.

You'll learn about Mama Cass Elliot's perpetual open house and her penchant for trading drugs for sex with good-looking young men and about the major substance abuse problems that plagued the Eagles, David Crosby, and others&#x2014;problems that eventually took the lives of such major talents as Jim Morrison and Gram Parsons. </p><p>Hotel California is a narrative of rise and fall&#x2014;from the hootenanny love-in innocence of talented, fresh-eyed young women and men with acoustic guitars to the coked-out superstardom of mid-70s stadium rock. It tells an epic tale of songs and sunshine; sex, drugs, and denim; genius and greed. Packed with both fascinating anecdotes and sharp insights into the lives and careers of its larger-than-life subjects, this book captures a legendary era of musical discovery, the amazing results of successful creative collaboration, and the much darker side of fame, wealth, and unbridled ambition. You won't be able to put it down.</p><b>Advance praise for <i>Hotel California</i></b><p></p><p>"A British rock critic obsessed with America, Barney Hoskyns brings a genuine love as well as an outsider's keen eye to the rise and fall of the California scene in the sixties and seventies.

"Rip Van Winkle," another traditional favorite from the same historic period, tells the tale of man who fell asleep for twenty years and found his small town in the Catskill Mountains much changed by the time he awakened. Both are included&#x2014;along with many other tales&#x2014;in this classic collection by Washington Irving.</p><p>Washington Irving was an American author, essayist, biographer, historian, and diplomat of the early 19th century.</p><h2>Why People Die by Suicide</h2><p><p>In the wake of a suicide, the most troubling questions are invariably the most difficult to answer: How could we have known? What could we have done? And always, unremittingly: Why? Written by a clinical psychologist whose own life has been touched by suicide, this book offers the clearest account ever given of why some people choose to die.</p><p>Drawing on extensive clinical and epidemiological evidence, as well as personal experience, Thomas Joiner brings a comprehensive understanding to seemingly incomprehensible behavior. Among the many people who have considered, attempted, or died by suicide, he finds three factors that mark those most at risk of death: the feeling of being a burden on loved ones; the sense of isolation; and, chillingly, the learned ability to hurt oneself. Joiner tests his theory against diverse facts taken from clinical anecdotes, history, literature, popular culture, anthropology, epidemiology, genetics, and neurobiology--facts about suicide rates among men and women; white and African-American men; anorexics, athletes, prostitutes, and physicians; members of cults, sports fans, and citizens of nations in crisis. </p><p>The result is the most coherent and persuasive explanation ever given of why and how people overcome life's strongest instinct, self-preservation. Joiner's is a work that makes sense of the bewildering array of statistics and stories surrounding suicidal behavior; at the same time, it offers insight, guidance, and essential information to clinicians, scientists, and health practitioners, and to anyone whose life has been affected by suicide.</p></p><p>Thomas Joiner is Distinguished Research Professor and Bright-Burton Professor of Psychology at Florida State University.http://www.hup.harvard.edu/pdf/JOIWHY_excerpt.pdf</p><h2>The Deep Hot Biosphere: The Myth Of Fossil Fuels</h2><p>This book sets forth a set of truly controversial and astonishing theories: First, it proposes that below the surface of the earth is a biosphere of greater mass and volume than the biosphere the total sum of living things on our planet's continents and in its oceans. Second, it proposes that the inhabitants of this subterranean biosphere are not plants or animals as we know them, but heat-loving bacteria that survive on a diet consisting solely of hydrocarbons that is, natural gas and petroleum. And third and perhaps most heretically, the book advances the stunning idea that most hydrocarbons on Earth are not the byproduct of biological debris ("fossil fuels"), but were a common constituent of the materials from which the earth itself was formed some 4.5 billion years ago.<br>The implications are astounding. The theory proposes answers to often-asked questions: Is the deep hot biosphere where life originated, and do Mars and other seemingly barren planets contain deep biospheres? Even more provocatively, is it possible that there is an enormous store of hydrocarbons upwelling from deep within the earth that can provide us with abundant supplies of gas and petroleum?<br>However far-fetched these ideas seem, they are supported by a growing body of evidence, and by the indisputable stature and seriousness Gold brings to any scientific debate. In this book we see a brilliant and boldly original thinker, increasingly a rarity in modern science, as he develops potentially revolutionary ideas about how our world works.</p><p>Thomas Gold is a member of the National Academy of Sciences, a Fellow of the Royal Society, and an Emeritus Professor of Physics at Cornell University. Regarded as one of the most creative and wide-ranging scientists of his generation, he has taught at Cambridge University and Harvard, and for 20 years was the Director of the Cornell Center for Radiophysics and Space Research.<p>From the reviews:</p> <p>"always original, always important, usually controversial, and usually right"<br>- FROM THE FOREWORD BY FREEMAN DYSON</p> <p>"an extraordinary theory from one of the world's most original minds."<br>- NIGEL HAWKES, THE TIMES, LONDON</p> <p>"The leading supporter of the abiotic theory in the U.S. is Prof. Thomas Gold of Cornell. His 1999 book, The Deep Hot Biosphere (Springer-Verlag) is a thorough discussion of the issues. It is based in part on research financed by the U.S. Geological Survey. Among prominent scientists whose work supports the abiotic theory are Jean Whelan of the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute, Mahlon Kennicutt of Texas A&amp;M University, and J.F Kenny of the Gas Resources Corporation."<br>- http://www.humaneventsonline.com/article.php?id=4092</p> <p>"There is much to be said about this important book ... . Gold exhibits the irreversible and universal genius that we recognize in Aristotle and Leonardo da Vinci. ... The versatility and range of knowledge exhibited is remarkable. ... The Deep Hot Biosphere is a highly interesting and important book; it should be required reading for every geology student." (David Deming, Journal of Scientific Exploration, Vol. 17 (2), 2003)</p> <p>"Thomas Gold is a physicist who is not afraid of controversy. ... His big new theory ... is that oil and natural gas are produced by geology and chemistry of the hot deep layers below the Earth&#x2019;s surface ... .

(New Scientist, August, 2001)</p></p><h2>States and Power in Africa: Comparative Lessons in Authority and Control (Princeton Studies in International History and Politics, 85)</h2><p><p>Theories of international relations, assumed to be universally applicable, have failed to explain the creation of states in Africa. There, the interaction of power and space is dramatically different from what occurred in Europe. In his groundbreaking book, Jeffrey Herbst places the African state-building process in a truly comparative perspective, examining the problem of state consolidation from the precolonial period, through the short but intense interlude of European colonialism, to the modern era of independent states. Herbst's bold contention--that the conditions now facing African state-builders existed long before European penetration of the continent--is sure to provoke controversy, for it runs counter to the prevailing assumption that colonialism changed everything.</p><p>In identifying how the African state-building process differs from the European experience, Herbst addresses the fundamental problem confronting African leaders: how to extend authority over sparsely settled lands. Indeed, efforts to exert control over vast, inhospitable territories of low population density and varied environmental and geographical zones have resulted in devastating wars, millions of refugees, and dysfunctional governments perpetrating destructive policies.</p><p>Detailing the precise political calculations of distinct African leaders, Herbst isolates the basic dynamics of African state development. In analyzing how these leaders have attempted to consolidate power, he is able to evaluate a variety of policy alternatives for dealing with the fundamental political challenges facing African states today.</p></p><p><p>"An original and intriguing book, which I read with the greatest interest. Herbst's argument is provocative and lucidly presented. This book will be read and debated not only by Africanists but also by others in the political science community. It is the most important and successful contribution to the literature on African politics since Jackson and Rosberg's<i>Personal Rule in Black Africa.</i>"<b>--Robert H. Bates, Harvard University, author of<i>Open-Economy Politics: The Political Economy of the World Coffee Trade</i></b></p><p>"Herbst's arguments will excite controversy among students of African history and politics, who have built up an extensive story about European transformations of African politics. His analysis raises doubts about how deeply those transformations went; rather, he maintains that durable conditions of topography and social structure have long constrained African state formation. Herbst offers an integrated account of state formation, transformation, and deformation in sub-Saharan Africa."<b>--Charles Tilly, Columbia University, author of <i>Durable Inquality</i></b></p><b>Jeffrey Herbst</b> is Professor of Politics and International Affairs at Princeton University's Woodrow Wilson School.

In 1956, he set off for Harvard Yard, where he spent the next 4 years learning more than he initially planned. After three years with the U.S. Marine Corps, mostly in Asia, he began graduate studies at the University of California, Berkeley. He received his Ph.D. from Berkeley in 1969. He taught sociology at the University of Hawaii from 1968 through 1979, took time off from teaching and research to write full time for 8 years, and then joined the faculty at Chapman University in Southern California in 1987. Although an author of research articles and monographs, he is best known for the many texts he has written, which have been widely adopted in colleges throughout the United States and the world. He also has been active in the American Sociological Association for 25 years and served on the ASAï¿½&#39;s executive committee. He is also past president of the Pacific Sociological Association and California Sociological Association. He has been married to his wife, Sheila, for more than 40 years, and they have a son, Aaron, who would make any parent proud. As proof, he helped produce the world&#39;s two greatest grandchildren.

The book features meditations and exercises that are aimed at helping the practitioner channel energies in positive directions, strengthen self-esteem, improve overall health, and experience deep relaxation.</p><p>When it comes to creating the life you want, Shakti Gawain literally wrote <i>the</i> book. Now considered a classic, <i>Creative Visualization</i> teaches readers how to use their imaginations to manifest their deepest desires. In a straight-talking narrative, Gawain uses the first part to cover the basics, with chapters such as "How to Visualize," "Affirmations," and "Creative Visualization Only Works for the Good." Once she shows readers how visualization actually works, Gawain moves on to loftier discussions, such as "Contacting Your Higher Self," "Meeting Your Guide," "Setting Goals," and "Treasure Maps."<p> Fear not; this isn't a spiritual-lightweight book for people with a severe case of the "gimmes." Gawain has her priorities in the right place, and she cautions readers that creative visualization will not serve greed or shallow-minded thinking. For example, she discourages the cycle of trying to have more money, so you can do what you want in life, so you will be happier. "The way it actually works is the reverse," she explains. "You must first be who you really are, then do what you need to do, in order to have what you want." Yet she also writes an excellent chapter on letting go of the misguided guilt that inhibits readers from becoming truly prosperous. <i>--Gail Hudson</i></p><i>Creative Visualization</i>...

American sentiment seems to be leaning increasingly toward withdrawal in the face of such disarray. In this powerful, urgent essay, Robert Kagan elucidates the reasons why American withdrawal would be the worst possible response, based as it is on a fundamental and dangerous misreading of the world. Like a jungle that keeps growing back after being cut down, the world has always been full of dangerous actors who, left unchecked, possess the desire and ability to make things worse. Kagan makes clear how the &#x201c;realist&#x201d; impulse to recognize our limitations and focus on our failures misunderstands the essential role America has played for decades in keeping the world's worst instability in check. A true realism, he argues, is based on the understanding that the historical norm has always been toward chaos&#x2014;that the jungle will grow back, if we let it.</p><p>Robert Kagan is a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and a columnist for <i>The Washington Post.</i> He is also the author of <i>The Return of History and the End of Dreams, Dangerous Nation, Of Paradise and Power, </i>and <i>A Twilight Struggle. </i>He served in the U.S. State Department from 1984 to 1988.

The past seven-plus decades of relatively free trade, growing respect for individual rights, and relatively peaceful&nbsp;cooperation among nations&#x2014;the core elements of the liberal order&#x2014;have been a great historical aberration. Until 1945 the story of humankind going back thousands of years was a long tale of war, tyranny, and poverty. moments of peace were fleeting, democracy so rare as to seem almost accidental, and prosperity the luxury of the powerful few. Our own era has not lacked its horrors, its genocides, its oppressions, its barbarisms. Yet by historical standards, including the standards of the recent past, it has been a relative paradise.&nbsp;Between 1500 and 1945 scarcely a year passed when the strongest powers in the world, the great powers of Europe, were not at war, but since 1945 there have been no wars among the great powers. The great Cold War confrontation between the United States and the Soviet Union ended peacefully, a historical rarity. Meanwhile, deaths from all recent smaller wars have declined dramatically, as indeed have violent deaths of all kinds. Since the end of the Second World War the world has also enjoyed a period of prosperity unlike any other, with more than seven decades of global GDP growth averaging almost 3.5 percent per year, despite the 2007-2008 financial crisis. Since 1945 , some four billion people around the world have climbed out of poverty. The number of democratic governments has grown from no more than a dozen in 1939 to more than a hundred today. The power of the state has been curbed in favor of the individual in large parts of the world, and an ever-expanding panoply of individual rights has come to be respected. What Abraham Lincoln called the "better angels" of human nature have been encouraged, and some of human beings' worst impulses have been suppressed more effectively than before. But all this has been an anomaly in the history of human existence. The liberal world order is fragile and impermanent. Like a garden, it is ever under siege from the natural forces of history, the jungle whose vines and weeds constantly threaten to overwhelm it.<br><br>The American-led liberal world order has never been a natural phenomenon.

All this has been a great aberration, an anomaly in the recorded history of human existence. <br><br> Unfortunately, we tend to take our world for granted. We have lived so long inside the bubble of the liberal world order that we can imagine no other kind of world. We think it is natural and normal, even inevitable. We see all its flaws and wish it could be better, but it doesn't occur to us that the more likely alternative to it would be much, much worse. Unlike other cultures, which view history as a continuous cycle of growth and decay, or as stasis, we view history as having a direction and a purpose. We believe in "modernization," in stages of economic and political development, in the link between prosperity and democracy.&nbsp;As children of the Enlightenment, we believe the expansion of knowledge and material progress goes hand in hand with improvements in human behavior and moral progress. From Montesquieu and Kant we learned&nbsp;that commerce tames the souls of men and nations, reducing conflict and increasing harmony and cooperation. From Marx and others we learned to treat stages of economic developmentas the drivers of political development&#x2014;feudalism produces government by monarchs and aristocrats, capitalismproduces government by parliaments and democracies, all as part of some iron logic of economic determinism. From Hegel we learned that history is but "the progress of the consciousnessof freedom" and that, as Francis Fukuyama put it in his famous description of the "End of History," there is "a common evolutionary pattern for all societies . . . something like a Universal History of mankind in the direction of liberal democracy." Hence we have come to believe that, while there may be occasional bumps and detours on the road, progress is inevitable.<br><br> This story of human progress is a myth, however. If the last century has taught us anything, it is that scientific and technological progress and the expansion of knowledge, while capable of improving our lives materially, have brought no lasting improvement in human behavior. Nor is history rightly viewed as a progressive upward march toward enlightenment. That perception rests on a carefully curated set of facts. We jump from Periclean Athens to the birth of Christianity, from the Renaissance to the Reformation, from the Magna Carta to the American Revolution. Omitted from this tale of golden ages and great leaps forward are the dark ages and great leaps backward. When it comes to human behavior, history is a jagged line with no discernible slope. Where on the scale of progress would we put the Thirty Years&#x2019; War, which killed off almost half the populations of the German principalities, or the Napoleonic Wars, which killed more than three million&nbsp;Europeans, destroyed the lives of many millions more, and helped produce the revolutionary nationalism that would wreak so much havoc in the first decades of the twentieth century? How do World War I, World War II, the famines, and the genocides of the last century fit into our story of human progress? Were the horrors perpetrated against Ukrainians and Chinese in the 1930s&nbsp;and against Jews in the 1940s part of our story of progress? Were they just aberrations, or were they harbingers of the future? Only by ignoring much horrendous bloodshed and brutality, and quite recently in historical terms, can we believe that there has been anything like a steady improvement in the way humans treat each other.<br><br>Nor has there been steady progress toward liberalism. Liberal government flickered into existence at the end of the eighteenth century, first in Great Britain and America and then, inspired by the French Revolution, in parts of Europe in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. But as liberalism grew, so did the modern police state, which was born in Austria, Prussia, and Russia at the end of the eighteenth century and was gradually perfected in the nineteenth and twentieth. (And the French Revolution did not produce liberalism in France before going through stages of totalitarianism followed by strongman rule.) Stirrings of liberalism in nineteenth-century Germany, Italy, and Poland were repeatedly crushed by absolutist powers using force,&nbsp;repression, and censorship. A brief flowering&nbsp;of democratic government after World War I was quickly extinguished and supplanted by the rise of fascism and communism. If the Second World War had produced a different set of victors, as it might have, liberalism might&nbsp;not have survived the twentieth century outside of North America.<br><br>Few in the middle of the last century saw liberalism on the rise. A survey of the world in 1939 would not have suggestedto anyone that history was pointing toward a triumph of the liberal idea. "I am . . . a bear on democracy," Joseph Kennedy told Walter Lippmann in London that year. "It&#x2019;s gone already." As Hannah Arendt put it, writing in 1950, to view Western Civilization as a steady march of progress was to ignore the "subterranean stream of Western history." History had not led to the triumph of liberalism; it had led to Hitler and Stalin. Throughout the Cold War, which seemed as if it would last forever, there was little reason to regard history as a steady progression toward a better world. The political theorist Judith Shklar, writing in the late 1950s, observed that in an age of two world wars, totalitarianism, and mass murder, "no reasonable person" could "believe in any 'law' of progress." After witnessing humanity at its worst, Arendt insisted, "we can no longer afford to take that which was good in the past and simply call it our heritage, to discard the bad and simply think of it as a heavy load which by itself time will bury in oblivion."<br><br>But apparently we can. Among the worst horrors of recorded history occurred in the lifetimes of our grandparents. Just seventy-five years ago Hitler was rampaging across Europe, Stalin was starving millions through forced collectivization, Japanese soldiers were raping and killing in Nanjing, millions were systematically being put to death in gas chambers in Eastern and Central Europe, and the United States was dropping nuclear bombs on Japanese cities. Yet after a few remarkable decades of relative peace, prosperity, and democracy, many became convinced that the human race had changed fundamentally, that after millennia of war, poverty, and tyranny, of individual and collective brutality, of tribalism and racism, human beings had over the course of a few decades suddenly become less violent, less warlike, more caring, more open. Some international relations theorists continue to believe that "the grand mechanism for overturning old international orders&#x2014;great power war&#x2014;has disappeared"; law professors argue that the very "nature of conflict" among nations "has changed fundamentally" (because of the Kellogg-Briand Pact of 1928 "outlawing war"); the cognitive psychologist Steven Pinker, who documents the decline of violence in the world since 1945, argues that the reason this happened in such a "short span of time was that the arguments that slew them belong to a coherent philosophy that emerged during the Age of Reason and the Englightenment." Perhaps fewer people today believe that the "liberal idea," all but extinguished in the 1930s, won an irreversible victory after the collapse of Soviet communism, now that authoritarianism is enjoying a renaissance. But many continue to assume that, even so, our dark recent past is indeed in the past and cannot recur.<br>Here is an alternative hypothesis. We have witnessed amazingprogress over the past seven decades, and not just technologicalprogress but also human progress. Yet this progress was not the culmination of anything. It was not the product of evolution, of expanding knowledge, of technological advances, the spread of commerce, and least of all of any change in the basic nature of human beings. It has been the product of a unique set of circumstances contingent on a particular set of historical outcomes, including on the battlefield, that could have turned out differently. It has been, above all, the by-product of a new configuration of power in the international system, the rise to preeminence of a new player on the international scene with a unique and advantageous geography, a large and productive population, unprecedented economic and military power, and, as it happened, a national ideology based on the liberal principles of the Enlightenment. The present world order has favored liberalism, democracy, and capitalism not only because they are right and better&#x2014;presumably they were right and better in the 1930s, too&#x2014;but because the most powerful nation in the world since 1945 has been a liberal democratic capitalist nation. That, too, was not fated but was the consequence of unique circumstances and contingent historical events. After World War II, because of America's unrivaled power, those Enlightenment principles suddenly enjoyed a force behind them that they had never before possessed. What we liberals call progress has been made possible by the protection afforded liberalism within the geographical and geopolitical space created by American power. This was not the inevitable unfolding of some Universal History. On the contrary, the creation of the liberal order has been an act of defiance against both history and human nature.<br><br>People today ask what threatens the present order, but that is the wrong question. The order is an artificial creation subject to the forces of geopolitical inertia. Deeply etched patterns of&nbsp;history, interrupted these past seven decades, remain and exert their pull. The question is not what will bring down the liberal order but what can possibly hold it up? If the liberal order is like a garden, artificial and forever threatened by the forces of nature, preserving it requires a persistent, unending struggle against the vines and weeds that are constantly working to undermine it from within and overwhelm it from without.<br>&nbsp;<br>Today there are signs all around us that the jungle is growing back. Where once many hoped that all the nations and peoples of the world would converge on a common path of liberal democratic capitalist development, we now see authoritarianism surviving if not thriving. Today a Russian dictator and European would-be dictators boast of their illiberalism, and a Chinese leader, wielding the absolute power of a Mao, portrays his nation as a model for the world. Where once we believed that economic success must eventually require political liberalization, we now see autocracies successfully practicing a state capitalism compatible with repressive&nbsp;government. Where once many believed geo-economics had replaced geopolitics, today we see the world returning to a geopolitics much like that of the late nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Territorial aggression, once thought to be an anachronism, has returned to Europe and threatens to return to Asia. Where once people believed that the nation-state was a thing of the past in an increasingly cosmopolitan and interconnected age, we now see nationalism and tribalism reemerging, more than able to hold their own in the brave new world of the Internet.&nbsp;Meanwhile, a profound and extended crisis of confidence&nbsp;besets the democratic world, even in the birthplace of modern democracy.

Steven usually works using lights. I almost always work with only the ambient light I find where I&#x2019;m shooting. </p> <p>But as different as these two ways of working are, the approaches we use to lighting our subjects are almost identical. That&#x2019;s because no matter where you find it or what its sources may be, light always behaves in certain predictable ways. </p> <p>Take this portrait of my friend Howard. To make it I moved him into the &#x201c;open&#x201d; shade of a nearby barn. This flooded him with the kind of softly diffused light I had pre-visualized for the picture. </p> <p>I then positioned Howard close to the edge of the barn&#x2019;s shadow. This allowed a small number of the sun&#x2019;s brighter rays to fall on the camera right side of his face. </p> <p>The result of this slightly uneven lighting was twofold. First, Howard&#x2019;s facial features were nicely modeled and second, the diffused light prevented any unattractive hard-edged shadows on it. </p> <p>What&#x2019;s important about the above is that I was able to use the ambient light I found on a location to make this portrait using exactly the same basic approach that Steven could use to produce identical looking lighting using studio strobes. Simply put, light is light, and it<i> always </i>follows the same laws of nature wherever it is and whatever produces it.</p> <p>And that&#x2019;s <i>exactly</i> what <i>Light--Science &amp; Magic</i> is all about. </p> <p>-- Paul Fuqua</p> <b>Featured Photographs from the Authors of <i>Light--Science &amp; Magic</i></b><br> <table> <tbody> <tr> <td> This glass of water was photographed with two lights--one on the background and the other in the foreground.

Christopher Capozzola shows how, when the war began, Americans at first mobilized society by stressing duty, obligation, and responsibility over rights and freedoms. But the heated temper of war quickly unleashed coercion on an unprecedented scale, making wartime America the scene of some of the nation's most serious political violence, including notorious episodes of outright mob violence. To solve this problem, Americans turned over increasing amounts of power to the federal government. In the end, whether they were some of the four million men drafted under the Selective Service Act or the tens of millions of home-front volunteers, Americans of the World War I era created a new American state, and new ways of being American citizens.<br></p><p><br><strong>Christopher Capozzola</strong> is an Associate Professor of History at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.<br><br>"This book demonstrates the singular significance of America's brief but crucial experience with modern war in 1917 and 1918."--Michael S. Neiberg, <em>The Journal of American History</em> <br> <br><p></p><br>"But do you want Uncle Sam? Capozzola's fresh history of the American past is a bracing challenge to the American present--and future."--James Carroll, author of <em>House of War</em><p></p><br>"Capozzola does an excellent job of rendering the jingoistic, dogmatic mindset that characterized the country at a crucial time...All this the author captures in eloquently rendered and assiduously researched detail."--<em>Publishers Weekly</em> (starred review)<p></p><br>"A well crafted and important work that adds critical depth to the historical understanding of this transformative period of American history. Capozzola convincingly argues that during World War I the power of the state grew at the expense of citizens' rights."--Andrew Wiest, <em>History: Reviews of New</em> <em>Books</em><p></p><br>"A sharp sense of irony and dry wit undergird this eloquent history of how Americans remade their understanding of the relationship between state and citizen in the crucible of World War I. We now live with the massive structures of state power that were first constructed then; we share many of that generation's obligations and anxieties. Can we learn from their mistakes?"--Linda K. Kerber, author of <em>No Constitutional Right to Be Ladies: Women and the Obligations of Citizenship</em><p></p><br>"<em>Uncle Sam Wants You</em> immerses readers in one of the formative moments of the twentieth century, when the fervent production of war-time loyalty collided with much weaker voices of civil liberties and dissent. In an eloquent blend of historical narrative and political theory, Capozzola pursues the question: what can the state legitimately demand of its citizens? This is a powerfully told and eye-opening history whose implications will bring readers right up to the present."--Daniel T. Rodgers, author of <em>Atlantic Crossings: Social Politics in a Progressive Age</em><p></p><br>"The stresses of wartime inevitably change a society, both in the short and the long term. Christopher Capozzola's <em>Uncle Sam Wants You</em> brilliantly illuminates the powerful and often unnoticed impact of World War I on American culture. By so doing, it sheds essential light on contemporary controversies that will affect the United States for years to come."--Geoffrey R. Stone, University of Chicago<p></p><br>"Capozzola brings politics into social history, and paints a more vivid picture of the pervasiveness of wartime repression than has so far been available...[R]eaders are unlikely to find a fresher, more substantial exploration of the repressive atmosphere of World War I anytime soon."--<em>The History</em> <em>Teacher</em><p></p><br>"You will gain many fresh insights by reading Capozzola's finely nuanced study about how the domestic impact of the war did and did not change the conception of what it meant to be an American citizen."--Michael E. Parrish, <em>Journal of Interdisciplinary History</em><p></p><br>"Capozzola succeeds in bringing political theory to the ground level. Engaged writing style and compelling analysis will make the book useful in advanced undergraduate and graduate history, political science, and political theory courses alike."--Beatrice McKenzie, <em>The Historian</em><p></p><br>"Capozzola writes with a vividness and verve. Essential reading not just for experts in the period but for anyone interested in the broader themes of American history, especially those wanting to learn about the development of its political culture."--Steven Casey, <em>War in History</em><p></p><br>"Readers of Capozzola's book will be struck by the stark contrasts concerning US participation in the Great War and the current war on terror."--<em>CHOICE</em><p></p><br>"Subtle, complex, and remarkably balanced. A very well-written book on a period of American history just now starting to get the scholarly attention it deserves. A book all historians of modern America should not only be familiar with, but be able to enjoy reading as well."--Mark E.

His black humor, satiric voice, and incomparable imagination first captured America&#x2019;s attention in&nbsp;<i>The Sirens of Titan</i>&nbsp;in 1959 and established him, in the words of&nbsp;<i>The New York Times</i>, as &#x201c;a true artist&#x201d; with the publication of&nbsp;<i>Cat&#x2019;s Cradle</i>&nbsp;in 1963. He was, as Graham Greene declared, &#x201c;one of the best living American writers.&#x201d; Mr. Vonnegut passed away in April 2007.Return of the Old Rambler, doing a replay on his 1981 autobiographical collage Palm Sunday, this time pasting together a memoir from speeches, forewords, articles, and so on written since 1981. Norman Mailer invented this format with Advertisements for Myself (1959) and no one, including Mailer, has done it as well since. Vonnegut adds plenty of humor to his new model but not much sinew. There's something truly self-defeating about parenthetical asides that leave each page of copy slack with interruptions. He includes vague forewords to Franklin Library editions of his more recent novels; writes of his brushes with Salman Rushdie (who, despite a friendship with Vonnegut, shot down one of his novels, with Vonnegut seriously thinking of adding another team to the hit list on Rushdie); comments on the firebombing of Dresden; recalls dead friends who appeared in Slaughterhouse-Five and dead fellow novelists Nelson Algren, Donald Barthelme, Hemingway, James Jones, Irwin Shaw, and others; and discusses his own incompetence as a speech-writer, his dislike of or inability to read his own works, and a suicide attempt that was foiled by a stomach pump. Vonnegut pictures himself as a depressive, though his less-than-faint hope for humanity is not as corroded as Mark Twain's during his later years. Vonnegut's most well-developed theme is in the title, as he weighs fates worse than death, including crucifixion (enslavement by the Reverend Jim Jones of the Guyana Kool-Aid horror doesn't measure up). His most memorable moments are about his first wife Jane and her death from cancer; his architect father, who never got a chance to show his stuff; and his deep feelings for fellow Dresden POW Bernard V. O'Hare. Vonnegut writes best about people, while his think pieces are sliced up with asides or dry-gulched by his alter ego. Patchy. -- <i>Copyright ï¿½1991, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Just as they worked to make sense of industrial capitalism, so does Castells put forth a systemic analysis of the global informational capitalism that emerged in the last half of the 20th century. While many books have considered the development of increasingly sophisticated information technology, the shifting conditions of employment and responsibility within corporations, or the rise of corporations whose domains are spread out over several nation-states, Castells unites these topics in a comprehensive thesis, negotiating the tightrope between academic sociology and mainstream business analysis.This book, the first in Castells' ground-breaking trilogy, is an account of the economic and social dynamics of the new age of information. Based on research in the USA, Asia, Latin America, and Europe, it aims to formulate a systematic theory of the information society which takes account of the fundamental effects of information technology on the contemporary world.<br> <p>The global economy is now characterized by the almost instantaneous flow and exchange of information, capital, and cultural communication. These flows order and condition both consumption and production. The networks themselves reflect and create distinctive cultures. Both they and the traffic they carry are largely outside national regulation. Our dependence on the new modes of informational flow gives enormous power to those in a position to control them to control us. The main political arena is now the media, and the media are not politically answerable.<br> </p> <p>Manuel Castells describes the accelerating pace of innovation and social transformation. He examines the processes of globalization that threaten to make redundant whole countries and peoples excluded from informational networks. He investigates the culture, institutions, and organizations of the network enterprise and the concomitant transformation of work and employment. He shows that in the advanced economies production is now concentrated on an educated section of the population aged between 25 and 40. He suggests that the effect of this accelerating trend may not be mass unemployment but the extreme flexibilization of work and individualization of labor, and, in consequence, a highly segmented social structure.<br> </p> <p>This new edition of <i>The Rise of the Network Society</i> has been substantially modified and details the new social and economic developments brought by the Internet and the 'new economy'.

Written by experts for the newcomer, they demonstrate the finest contemporary thinking about the central problems and issues in hundreds of key topics, from philosophy to Freud, quantum theory to Islam</p><p>Dr Norman Solomon is a freelance writer and journalist, and a regular contributor to the Jewish Chronicle. He is a Fellow in Modern Jewish Thought at the Oxford Centre for Hebrew and Jewish Studies. His previous publications include Judaism and World Religion and he contributed to The Oxford<br>Companion to the Jewish Religion.It's not easy to sum up thousands of years of tradition in a few hours, but this recording does an admirable job. Norman Solomon begins by explaining Jewish identity in the past and present and describing the historical relationship between Judaism and Christianity. While he spends some time going over major Jewish thinkers, the most informative sections deal with Jewish celebrations and customs, including a warm and insightful chapter on keeping a Jewish home.

Honorary prime minister of the Black Panther Party. Bestselling author. Stokely Carmichael (Kwame Ture) is an American legend, one whose work as a civil rights leader fundamentally altered the course of history&#x2014;and our understanding of Pan-Africanism today. <i>Ready for Revolution</i> recounts the extraordinary course of Carmichael's life, from his Trinidadian youth to his consciousness-raising years in Harlem to his rise as the patriarch of the Black Power movement.<br> <br>In his own words, Carmichael tells the story of his fight for social justice with candor, wit, and passion&#x2014;and a cast of luminaries that includes James Baldwin, Toni Morrison, Bayard Rustin, Martin Luther King, Jr., Rosa Parks, Malcolm X, Ho Chi Minh, and Fidel Castro, among others. Carmichael's personal testimony captures the pulse of the cultural upheavals that characterize the modern world. This landmark, posthumously published autobiography reintroduces us to a man whose love of freedom fueled his fight for revolution to the end.</p><p>Stokely Carmichael (known as Kwame Ture later in his life) died before his autobiography, <i>Ready for Revolution: The Life and Struggles of Stokely Carmichael</i>, could be completed, so much of the text was stitched together from extensive taped sessions by his long-time friend, Ekwueme Michael Thelwell. What remains is a sometimes uneven but always stirring record one of the most fascinating and controversial figures of the Twentieth Century. <p> Carmichael was born in Trinidad, but his life as an activist began with his immersion in the Civil Rights movement at the Bronx High School of Science and then Howard University in the 1950s and 60s. At Howard he joined the Nonviolent Action Group (NAG) and later, the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC), through which he drove voter registration efforts in Mississippi and Alabama. Later, as chairman of the SNCC he moved beyond the teachings of nonviolent resistance and forged the Black Power movement, authoring one of its key documents, "Toward Black Liberation" with Thelwell. He became a nationally recognized figure, reviled by leaders on both the left and the right for his apparent abandonment of integration. Yet his vision for black self-determinism would empower a generation of African-American artists, scholars, and leaders to embrace a new vision of African and African-American identity that is still transforming black culture. Eventually, Carmichael settled in Guinea, where he became a member of the ruling party and spent his later years promulgating his vision for Pan-African revolution. </p><p> In the introduction to <i>Ready for Revolution</i>, Thelwell admits that, in keeping the story faithful to the recordings, he left it essentially a "first draft" of Carmichael's vision. Thelwell's intrusions in the text, whether his own points or thoughts of others whom he interviewed are bracketed--while this formal approach honors Carmichael's words, the passages are often distracting and would have been better left as endnotes. Further, Thelwell seems to let Carmichael's original text stand where some pruning would have been beneficial, notably in Carmichael's overly detailed recounting of his school days. That said, Thelwell has done a great service to African-American studies by shepherding Carmichael's controversial, quirky, and uncompromising autobiography into print. <i>--Patrick O'Kelley</i></p>Stokely Carmichael, was among the most fiery and visible leaders of Black militancy in the United States in the 1960s, first as head of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) and then as prime minister of the Black Panther Party, where he coined the phrase "Black Power." In 1969 he cut his ties with American groiups over the issue of allying with White radicals, and moved to Guinea. He declared himself a pan-Africanist. In 1978 he changed his name to Kwame Ture, to honor African socialist leaders Kwame Nkrumah and Ahmed Sekoe Toure. He lived in Guinea for 33 years, until his diagnosis with prostate cancer. He died on November 15, 1998.<br><br>Michael Thelwell has been a professor of Afro-American studies at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, since 1969. Before that he was a civil rights worker. He is also the author of one novel, and many articles and essays on politics and civil rights.<br><br>John Edgar Wideman&#x2019;s books include <i>American Histories</i>, <i>Writing to Save a Life</i>, <i>Philadelphia Fire, Brothers and Keepers, Fatheralong, Hoop Dreams, </i>and <i>Sent for You Yesterday</i>. He is a MacArthur Fellow, has won the PEN/Faulkner Award twice, and has twice been a finalist for the National Book Critics Circle Award and National Book Award.

Through these talks, Almaas offers valuable guidance and advice for those on a spiritual path, and he explores the challenges and psychological barriers faced by those seeking self-realization.</p><p>First in the four-book Diamond Heart series, this collection of essays--taken from transcripts of seminars A.H. Almaas delivered over a several-year period--is an effective introduction to the Diamond Approach of inner realization. Lamenting that human suffering is due to not living up to one's human potential, Almaas proceeds to lay out in detail a uniquely modern and strictly logical path to enlightenment--its purpose to regain one's palpable human essence. Carefully leading the reader through stages of increasing depth and subtlety, he reveals hidden self-knowledge. Chapters with simple titles such as "Value," "Truth," and "Trust" open doors to realizations that result in relief from existential angst. If you have ever felt you were missing something you couldn't quite name, chapter 2--"The Theory of Holes"--is worth the price of admission. <i>--Randall Cohan</i>A. H. Almaas is the pen name of Hameed Ali, the Kuwaiti-born originator of the Diamond Approach, who has been guiding individuals and groups in Colorado, California, and Europe since 1976. He is the author of <i>Spacecrusier Inquiry</i>, <i>The Pearl Beyond Price</i>, <i>Facets of Unity</i>, and other books.&nbsp;<i> </i></p><h2>The Race (An Isaac Bell Adventure)</h2><p><p><b>20th century detective Isaac Bell protects a promising aviator from her jealous husband in this remarkable adventure from #1&nbsp;<i>New York Times</i>-bestselling author Clive Cussler.<br><br></b>It is 1910, the age of flying machines is still in its infancy, and newspaper publisher Preston Whiteway is offering $50,000 for the first daring aviator to cross America in less than fifty days.

Millions were killed, billions in property was destroyed, ancient cultures were reduced to rubble--World War II was truly man&#39;s greatest cataclysm. Thousands of books, movies and documentary films have been devoted to the war. There has never been such a terrible retelling of the story, however, as one will find in Hellstorm. In a chilling &#34;you-are-there&#34; style, the author places the reader at the scene, in the moment. Throughout this book readers will see what Allied airman saw as they rained down death on German cities; or the reader will experience what those below experienced as they sat trembling in their bomb shelters awaiting that very same death from above. The reader will view up close the horrors of the Eastern Front during the last months of fighting and through the mud, blood and madness of combat they may come to understand how the same German soldiers, who only moments before had destroyed an enemy tank, could now risk their own lives to rescue the trapped Soviet crew inside. Readers will witness for themselves the fate of German women as the rampaging Red Army raped and murdered its way across Europe--all females, from &#34;eight to eighty&#34; feared the dreaded words, &#34;Frau Komm.&#34; The worst nautical disasters in history which claimed thousands of lives, the greatest mass migration known to man in which millions perished, the fate of those wretched victims in post-war death camps and torture chambers, these and many other dark secrets of World War II now come to light in Hellstorm.</p><p></p><h2>CliffsComplete Shakespeare&#39;s King Lear</h2><p>In the CliffsComplete guides, the play's <i>complete</i> text and a glossary appear side-by-side with coordinating numbered lines to help you understand unusual words and phrasing.

She was also her Papa's "Little Queen." With her Mama, her Papa and her 4 big sisters to love her, Therese could have turned out to be a very spoiled little girl. And indeed, it is true that sometimes she was cross and naughty.<br><br> But Therese had hit upon a plan: she had decided to become a saint.

Before that, he had a long career, starring in such films as the Terminator series; <i>Stay Hungry</i>; <i>Twins</i>; <i>Predator</i>; and <i>Junior</i>. His first book, <i>Arnold: The Education of a Bodybuilder</i>, was a bestseller when published in 1977 and, along with his <i>Encyclopedia of Modern Bodybuilding</i>, has never been out of print since.<b>PART I: FITNESS AND BODYBUILDING</b><br><br><b>What Is Fitness?</b><br><br>Physical fitness involves the development of all of the body's physical capabilities.<br><br>For example, when exercise physiologists tested weightlifters and bodybuilders about twenty years ago they found these men had tremendous strength and muscular development, but that most of them lacked the endurance that comes from cardiovascular training. Their muscles were in great shape, but not their heart and lungs.<br><br>Lifting weights, it was then decided, leads to an unbalanced physical development. But then it occurred to somebody that that kind of a standard should work both ways. If you test a long-distance runner, you will generally find he has enormous capacity for endurance but, unless he has done some kind of resistance training, he will tend to lack strength, especially in the upper body. He is also unbalanced.<br><br>But things have changed a lot since that time. It is now difficult to find a weightlifter or bodybuilder who doesn't do some kind of aerobic training, and many endurance athletes -- particularly swimmers -- include a lot of strength-training in their workouts. And it is working: the totally fit athlete is not only healthier, but he has an edge over his competitors as well.<br><br>I have always followed this principle in my own training. Having been a competitive swimmer and soccer player before I became a bodybuilder, I knew what being in shape really means. So I always included a lot of, running and stretching movements in my workouts along with progressive-resistance weight training.<br><br>Total fitness, as I see it, has three components:<br><br><b>(1)</b> <i>Aerobic conditioning.</i> Aerobic activity is anything that uses up a lot of oxygen. Oxygen is delivered to the muscles by the cardiovascular system -- the lungs, heart and circulation of the blood. This system is developed by continuous, high-repetition exercise such as running, swimming, jumping rope, riding a bicycle, etc.<br><br><b>(2)</b> <i>Flexibility.</i> Muscles, tendons and ligaments tend to shorten over a period of time, which limits our range of motion and renders us more liable to injury when sudden stresses are placed on these structures. But we can counteract this tendency by stretching exercises and physical programs such as yoga.<br><br><b>(3)</b> <i>Muscular Conditioning.</i> There is only one way to develop and strengthen the muscles: resistance training. When you contract the muscles against resistance, they adapt to this level of effort. The best and most efficient way of doing this is through weight training.<br><br>Beyond this, once we have the body in shape, we have to learn to use it. This is where sports and athletic activities come in. But we cannot fully enjoy the act of physical play if we haven't developed the basic physical systems with which we have been endowed.<br><br>Nutrition and diet are also essential. It makes no sense to make demands on the body if you haven't given it the nutrients it needs to function properly. Therefore an important part of this program involves learning how and what to eat to maximize health and energy.<br><br>But of all these areas the one which is most often misunderstood -- and which in many ways incorporates the widest range of benefits -- is weight training. And the reason that progressive-resistance weight training is so valuable to building and maintaining health and strength become obvious once you take a look at the nature of the muscle that makes up the human body.<br><br><b>The Nature of Muscle</b><br><br>There are three kinds of muscle in the body, each with its own characteristics.<br><br><b>(1)</b> <i>Smooth muscle</i> is found in the walls of internal or visceral organs such as blood vessels and intestines.<br><br><b>(2)</b> <i>Cardiac muscle</i> is the tissue that makes up the heart, and it can be strengthened by cardiovascular, high-repetition exercise.<br><br><b>(3)</b> <i>Skeletal muscle</i> is the system of long muscles that control the movement of the body. It is this kind of muscle, under voluntary control, that weight training is designed to strengthen and condition.<br><br>Muscle has one simple function -- it contracts. Nothing else. That is why our bodies are designed with opposing muscles or sets of muscles. When you extend or move a part of the body in one direction, it takes the contraction of an opposing muscle to bring it back.<br><br>We have muscles because of gravity. Our planet's gravitational field holds us prisoner, and the purpose of muscle is to overcome this basic force. If we lived on a larger planet with a stronger gravitational field, we would have larger muscles. If evolution had prepared us for life on the moon with its one-sixth earth gravity, our muscular structure would be correspondingly lighter.<br><br>Muscle is highly adaptive. It changes according to the demands put upon it. For example, a friend of mine broke his leg skiing and was confined to a hospital bed for several weeks. When the cast finally came off, I could hardly believe how thin and weak the injured leg had become. Kept immobile by the cast, the muscles had shrunk noticeably.<br><br>The same sort of thing happened to our astronauts who spent so much time in Skylab. I was discussing physical fitness with some NASA officials recently and they told me that these men practically had to learn to walk all over again after returning from long periods of weightlessness in space. Outside the earth's normal gravitational field, their muscles had become maladapted for moving around the planet.<br><br>When you lift a weight, or work against some other sort of resistance, you are, in effect, creating an artificial gravitational field. When I was training to win my Mr. Olympia titles and was lifting enormous weights every day in the gym, it was as if I were living on a giant planet like Jupiter instead of the earth. As a result, my body was forced to adapt to this extra effort and my muscles became stronger and more massive.<br><br>Since I train these days as much for flexibility, coordination and endurance as for strength, my physique has changed. But by going back to my former hard training for six months or so, I could build myself back up from 215 to my solid 240-pound competition weight. Other people may not be able to make gains like this -- a lot of it is genetic -- but the basic principle is the same: use a muscle and it gets bigger and stronger; fail to subject it to sufficient stress and it will get weaker and smaller.<br><br><b>Muscle Size and Strength</b><br><br>The shrinking of a muscle due to underuse is called <i>atrophy.</i> The increase in size of muscle when it is subjected to greater amounts of stress is called <i>hypertrophy.</i><br><br>Muscle tissue itself is composed of bundles of fibers. These fibers are really tiny, and they are wrapped together and bound in a sheath of tissue for strength. We are each given a certain number of these fibers at birth, and we can't increase them through diet, exercise, or any other means. But we can do a lot to alter their size and strength.<br><br>Strength is a matter of several factors:<br><br><b>(1)</b> The number of fibers in a muscle.<br><br><b>(2)</b> The number of fibers that participate in any given muscular contraction.<br><br><b>(3)</b> The strength and thickness of the individual fibers.<br><br>When you attempt to contract a muscle, you are actually only using a percentage of the fibers that are theoretically available to you. You use only the number that you need to use.<br><br>If you keep trying to work against heavier and heavier amounts of resistance, the body adapts by causing more and more of the muscle fibers to engage in the contraction. This takes some time, and there is obviously a physiological limit to this process. But it remains true that the way you get stronger through resistance training is by forcing the muscles to call on increased numbers of muscle fibers to do the work you are asking of them.<br><br>In this way, the body is not like a machine. If you connect a 10-horsepower motor to a 12-horsepower load, it will burn out. But if you demand a 12-horsepower effort from a 10-horsepower body, it becomes a 12-horsepower body.<br><br>Other things happen to the muscles when you train and condition them. The fibers become enlarged, the sheath covering the muscles gets tougher and the body creates more capillaries to carry more blood to the area.<br><br><b>Progressive-Resistance Training</b><br><br>Exercises like calisthenics, running or swimming are the fixed-resistance kind. That is, no matter how long you do them, you are always contracting the muscles against the same amount of resistance. You may learn to do the movements for longer periods of time, which means your endurance has improved, but you will not get any stronger no matter how many repetitions you do.<br><br>To keep getting stronger, you have to keep increasing the resistance so that the muscles must continue to adapt. This is called progressive-resistance training. This is the principle that is used in weight training and bodybuilding.<br><br>Progressive-resistance training is a great equalizer. It never gets easy. You may be lifting 10 pounds and I may be lifting 100 pounds, but as long as we are both working at the limit of our strength, we are essentially doing an equal amount of work. All that counts is that we are forcing the muscle to work hard enough to make it adapt.<br><br><b>What Is Bodybuilding?</b><br><br>Although bodybuilders lift weights in order to achieve their physical goals, bodybuilding is not an activity in which the absolute amount of weight you can lift is important. The aim of bodybuilding is to use a sufficient amount of weight for each exercise to cause the adaptive changes in the body that result in the creation of an ideal blend of mass, muscularity, symmetry and proportion.<br><br>Weightlifters train with weights, too, but they are only interested in learning to lift as much weight as possible, and then only for the few particular lifts that are involved in competition.<br><br>It was long thought that bodybuilders weren't really all that strong, that the mass they developed in the gym was somehow not "real" muscle. This is simply not true. Strength is a necessary by-product of the development of mass and the success of bodybuilders in recent strongman competitions proves it.<br><br>But the use of weights in progressive-resistance training is a common denominator among bodybuilders, weightlifers, athletes training for certain sports, individuals with injuries trying to rehabilitate their bodies, and all those millions who are now training for health and fitness.<br><br>Weight training, in its most general sense, just means doing some movement or activity using added weight to increase the difficulty. This would include putting weights on your ankles before you run, or swinging a lead-filled bat before your turn at the plate, but usually we restrict the meaning to contracting your muscles in certain, prescribed exercises against the resistance of dumbbells, barbells or resistance exercise machines.<br><br>Bodybuilders actually have more in common with the man training for fitness than with competition weightlifters. After all, both are more interested in physical self-improvement than in breaking lifting records.<br><br>But there is a large difference in degree. It is as if bodybuilders were Formula I racing cars, and the average man a reliable sports-sedan. Both want a certain degree of performance, but on two distinct levels. The technology that comes out of Grand Prix racing eventually filters down to the family car, and, in the same way, the discoveries made by serious bodybuilders in the gym can be adapted and made use of by those who are using weights to stay trim and healthy.<br><br>You may personally have no desire to train for hours a day to become a Mr. America, but exercise physiologists have shown us how much alike in their physical needs are the athlete and the non-athlete. If you apply the techniques that work for champions, only at a level of intensity that suits your own purposes, you will be able to share in the same process that creates, shapes and firms the human body, melts away unwanted fat, and builds a strong, dependable cardiovascular system.<br><br><b>Weight Training -- What to Expect</b><br><br>Most men don't really know what to expect from weight training. For instance, it is common in gyms to find some skinny guy just starting training who assures everybody, "I want to get into better condition, but I don't want to get too big." But, the thing is, getting <i>really</i> big is tremendously difficult if not impossible for most people. It takes some eight to twelve years of intense, determined, mind-boggling work to produce a Mr. Olympia physique, and that's only if you have the right genetic potential in the first place. After all, you wouldn't expect necessarily to be able to run a sub-four-minute mile just by practicing a lot. You have to have the talent for it.<br><br>But that doesn't mean there is no benefit from weight training for the average man. Quite the contrary. For all but a few there is a definite increase in strength and muscular size along with an improvement in shape and contour of the muscles. The body gets firmer as muscle fibers become more dense and fat is burned off. The body becomes strong, hard and lean instead of weak, soft and fat.<br><br>Some people will change a lot, and others somewhat less. But even seemingly small changes can make a dramatic change in your physique. An inch or two extra around the chest coupled with a loss of a couple of inches around the middle will completely transform how you look. You can never step outside your natural somatotype -- the actual structure of your body as determined by your genes -- but you can accomplish a great deal within those limits.<br><br>It is difficult to increase muscle mass by more than 5 pounds a year. If you have already had extra mass at one time, it is a lot easier to get it back than it is to create it in the first place. A really talented athlete might be able to build 10 pounds of muscle mass a year, but that is a lot.<br><br>However, if 5 pounds a year doesn't sound like much, think of it this way: 5 pounds a year is 25 pounds in 5 years. That means a 150-pound man could expect to weigh 175 pounds five years from now with hard training and without gaining any fat.<br><br>But, remember, even if you don't really want to get any bigger, all you are doing is increasing your strength to its natural optimum and letting the muscles assume whatever mass is natural to them. A certain amount of mass comes with the territory. The chances of its getting out of hand are pretty remote. And there are a lot of bodybuilders who were never able to develop themselves quite enough who can testify to that!<br><br>Meanwhile, as your body improves a psychological benefit comes along with it. You feel better because your training gives you more energy. You feel better about yourself as well, and have greater self-confidence. This affects how you act, and how people treat you. You look better, which makes you feel better. And when you feel better, you naturally end up looking better. It's kind of a non-vicious circle, and it works.<br><br><b>On the Other Hand...</b><br><br>In my experience, only a handful of people out of any group get interested enough in training to want to go into it more seriously. However, you might be one of that handful. If you are -- and you may be and just not know it yet -- let me assure you that the exercise programs outlined in this book are fundamental to bodybuilding as well as weight training for conditioning, and that nothing you learn here will be wasted.<br><br>In another section, for those who are interested, I will deal in more detail with the differences between conditioning workouts ...</p><h2>24 Hours That Changed the World: 40 Days of Reflection</h2><p><p>Pastor and popular author Adam Hamilton offers 40 days of devotions enabling us to pause, reflect, dig deeper, and emerge changed forever.

But Honor Harrington is going to give them a war that&#39;s neither short nor victorious.</p><p>David Weber is a science fiction phenomenon. His popular Honor Harrington space-opera adventures are &#34;New York Times&#34; bestsellers and can&#39;t come out fast enough for his devoted readers. Weber and his wife Sharon live in South Carolina.The archetypically villainous People's Republic of Haven is seeking to divert attention from domestic difficulties by the means indicated in the title. Honor Harrington, commanding a crack ship, plays a steadily increasing and finally decisive role in bringing the Havenite plots to a sticky end. One hopes the third (after <i>On Basilisk Station</i> [1993] and <i>The Honor of the Queen</i> [1993]) is not the last of Weber's tales of Honor Harrington, captain in the navy of the Manticoran Star Kingdom. These yarns rather make one think of <i>Star Wars</i> as it might have been written by C. S. Forester, creator of Horatio Hornblower. They do not pretend to be more than fast-paced entertainment, and Weber's creative ingenuity has guaranteed that they are that very nicely. <i>Roland Green</i></p><h2>The Nature of the Atonement: Four Views (Spectrum Multiview Book Series)</h2><p>A long history of biblical exegesis and theological reflection has shaped our understanding of the atonement today. The more prominent highlights of this history have acquired familiar names for the household of faith: <em>Christus Victor</em>, penal substitutionary, subjective, and governmental. Recently the penal substitutionary view, and particularly its misappropriations, has been critiqued, and a lively debate has taken hold within evangelicalism. This book offers a "panel" discussion of four views of atonement maintained by four evangelical scholars. The proponents and their views are: Gregory A. Boyd: <em>Christus Victor</em> view Joel B. Green: Kaleidescopic view Bruce R. Reichenbach: Healing view Thomas R. Schreiner: Penal Substitutionary view Following an introduction written by the editors, each participant first puts forth the case for their view. Each view is followed by responses from the other three participants, noting points of agreement as well as disagreement. This is a book that will help Christians understand the issues, grasp the differences and proceed toward a clearer articulation of their understanding of the atonement.</p><p><strong>James Beilby</strong> and <strong>Paul R. Eddy</strong> both teach theology at Bethel University, St. Paul, Minnesota. They also edited <em>Divine Foreknowledge: Four Views.</em>"The directness of the responses is a strength of the book. It serves to highlight differences, expose weak points, and provide the reader with questions and issues to pursue. The book makes a positive contribution both through highlighting the diversity of thinking about the atonement within evangelicalism and through encouraging discussion about this diversity." (Mark D. Baker, Religious Studies Review, March 2010)<br><br>"One strength of this study is its multifaceted scope. The book presents four views side by side and allows the reader quickly to see what the primary differences and similarities are between the various positions. By including defenses of positions by those who hold to these divergent views, this volume adds a valuable dimension to the evangelical discussion on the issue of the atonement." (Ched Spellman on Says Simpleton, April 11, 2008)<br><br>"Those looking for evangelical and scripturally founded treatments of the atonement will find this book a lively register of current opinions." (Journal for the Study of the New Testament, 2007)<br><br>"There are a number of reasons to applaud <em>The Nature of the Atonement</em>, not least its provocative and illuminating presentation. . . . If you are looking for a more focused discussion on the atonement--that is, in terms of today's evangelical milieu, <em>The Nature of the Atonement</em> can certainly serve as a fine forum for exploring essential matters of the Christian faith."

(Yes, folks: that includes <i>Please Kill Me</i>.) Great book!"&#x2014;Richard Meltzer</p><p>Production has started on the documentary feature based on the book.</p></p><p>Since his influential collection, Apocalypse Culture, was first released in 1987, the award-winning writer Adam Parfrey has been credited for discovering and revealing the inner workings of cults and unusual pop culture histories. With &#34;Love, Sex, Fear, Death,&#34; Parfrey has captured the cooperation of primary players in the most secretive and talked about cult of our time.Since his heroin overdose in 1980, Darby Crash has become a symbol of punk irreverence, but his posthumous fame has tended to overshadow the seminal work of the punk band he fronted, the Germs. Mullen (who coauthored We Got the Neutron Bomb: The Untold Story of L.A. Punk), along with ex-Germs drummer Bolles and writer Parfrey, quickly deconstructs the myth of Crash (n Jan Paul Beahm) to reveal an embattled and confused soul who struggled with drug use and his homosexuality. Featuring raw quotations from Crash's peers in the burgeoning 1970s West Coast punk scene, the book offers both positive and negative views of the singer and the scene that raised him. Crash's fans were known for their cultish reverence, and Crash himself is shown to be a self-conscious misfit who used psychological ploys to enlist followers. It is unlikely that this book will reach a wide audience and thus imbue Crash's legacy with more humanity and, in turn, the Germs with more respectability, but it does strengthen the growing literature on American punk music. Recommended for popular music collections, especially as a complement to We Got the Neutron Bomb, which covers similar ground and whose oral history format this book replicates.

He is watched by the cold, hard eyes of peasants living long enough at a subsistence level to know exactly where the line is drawn between poverty and destitution. He looks like a beggar yet his eyes lack the proper cringe, his voice the proper whine, his walk the proper shuffle. He speaks about the rule of God and they listen as much from curiosity as anything else. They know all about rule and power, about kingdom and empire, but they know it in terms of tax and debt, malnutrition and sickness, agrarian oppression and demonic possession. What, they really want to know, can this kingdom of God do for a lame child, a blind parent, a demented soul screaming its tortured isolation among the graves that mark the edges of the village?

It opens with "The Gospel of Jesus," Crossan's studied determination of Jesus' actual words and actions stripped of any subsequent additions and placed in a capsule account of his life story. The Jesus who emerges is a savvy and courageous Jewish Mediterranean peasant, a radical social revolutionary, with a rhapsodic vision of economic, political, and religious egalitarianism and a social program for creating it. </p><p> The conventional wisdom of critical historical scholarship has long held that too little is known about the historical Jesus to say definitively much more than that he lived and had a tremendous impact on his followers. "There were always historians who said it could not be done because of historical problems," writes Crossan. "There were always theologians who said it should not be done because of theological objections. And there were always scholars who said the former when they meant the latter.</p></p><p>"Crossan's book is the one I've been looking for for ten years and never found.... It is elegant, even masterful. There is nothing like it for thoroughness, readability, balance, fairness, and clarity. He makes his method clear (combining peasant anthropology, ancient history, and textual analysis) without swamping you with it. He delivers the goods with a credible reconstruction of the historical Jesus and avoids projecting current ideologies."

William S.

BURROUGHS (1914 1997), one of this century s most influential writers and a member of the Academy of Arts and Letters, was the author of numerous books, including Naked Lunch, Nova Express, The Ticket That Exploded, and The Wild Boys. JACK KEROUAC (1922 1969) was one of the most inventive writers of the twentieth century and is considered the father of the Beat Generation.

If you&#x2019;re looking for the link between Hemingway&#x2019;s impotent post-war drifters in The Sun Also Rises, the barflies and Tralalas of Last Exit to Brooklyn and the zonked-out kids of Bret Easton Ellis&#x2019;s Less Than Zero, look no further.&#x201d; John Walsh, <i>The Independent</i><br><br> In alternating chapters, Burroughs and Kerouac serve up a noir vision of Manhattan Of the two, Kerouac, then in his early 20s, is the more developed writer, though Burroughs, an absolute beginner, already shows some of the interests and obsessions that will turn up in Naked Lunch and elsewhere, to say nothing of an obviously field-tested understanding of how syringes work For his part, Kerouac recounts wartime experiences in the Merchant Marine, along with notes on the bar scene that would do Bukowski proud.&#x201d;<br> <i>Kirkus Reviews</i><br><br> [Hippos] significantly predates Kerouac&#x2019;s major novels and illuminates his dynamic and productive literary friendship with William S.

Her mission: restoring our respect for the whole animal, developing a taste for its lesser known parts, and learning how to approach them in the kitchen as confidently as we would a steak or a burger. <br><br>Serious food lovers will delight in the sheer variety of the dishes that await, ranging from simple to challenging:<br>&nbsp;<br>ï¿½&nbsp; Headcheese for the Unconvinced<br>ï¿½&nbsp; Veal Cheeks with Swiss Chard and Olives<br>ï¿½&nbsp; Cheese and Just a Little Brain Fritters<br>ï¿½&nbsp; Lamb Neck with Quince and Turnip<br>ï¿½&nbsp; Brisket Braised with Caramelized Onions and Chile<br>ï¿½&nbsp; Sweetbreads with Morels and Fresh Fava Beans<br>ï¿½&nbsp; Moroccan-Style Braised Heart<br>ï¿½&nbsp; Minted Tripe and Pea Salad<br>ï¿½&nbsp; Wild Boar Shanks with Cranberries and Chocolate<br>ï¿½&nbsp; Bone Marrow and Mushroom Custard<br>&nbsp;<br>Much more than a cookbook, <i>Odd Bits</i> delves into the rich geographical, historical, and religious roles of these unusual meats.

Reduce the heat so the wine bubbles gently. Tip the saucepan slightly away from you and, using a long match, light the wine. Once the flames die out, light it again, and keep lighting it until it no longer flames. Pour the wine into a large bowl (there should be about 21/2 cups / 625 ml). Add the onion, carrots, celery, garlic, bay leaves, rosemary, and peppercorns. Set aside to cool. <p></p> Cut the beef cheeks into 2 or 3 pieces so that all the pieces are the same size. Place in the marinade, cover, and refrigerate overnight, turning a couple of times if possible. <p></p> Remove the cheeks from the marinade, pat them dry, and season with salt and pepper. Strain the marinade, keeping the liquid and the solids separate. <p></p> Preheat the oven to 300ï¿½F / 150ï¿½C. <p></p> In a heavy flameproof casserole or Dutch oven, melt half the fat over medium-high heat. When the fat is hot, add the cheeks in batches and brown. Transfer the cheeks to a plate. Lower the heat, add the vegetables, herbs, and peppercorns from the marinade, and cook, stirring, for 5 minutes, or until they soften. <p></p> Pour in the reserved marinade liquid and bring to a boil. Return the cheeks with any juices to the pan, add the calf&#x2019;s foot, and return to a boil. Cover the meat with a piece of wet parchment paper and the lid, transfer to the oven, and cook for 3 to 4 hours, or until the cheeks are very tender. <p></p> Transfer the cheeks and the foot to a plate. <p></p> Strain the cooking liquid through a sieve into a bowl, pressing on the vegetables to extract all the juice; discard the solids. Let the cooking liquid stand for 5 minutes, then skim off the fat and set the fat aside for another use. <p></p> Return the cooking liquid to the pan and bring to a boil. Continue to boil until the liquid coats the back of a spoon. Meanwhile, cut the meat and skin from the calf&#x2019;s foot into small dice; discard the bones. Return the cheeks and diced foot to the reduced sauce and reheat gently. Add the vinegar and taste, adding more salt, pepper, and/or vinegar if necessary. Sprinkle with the parsley and serve. <p></p> <b>Alternatives:</b> Oxtail, beef shoulder, or shank <p></p><p>Jennifer McLagan&nbsp;is a chef and food stylist and writer who has worked in Toronto, London, and Paris as well as her native Australia.

He once lifted the front of a truck just to find a clue.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; Mrs. Jansen said. &#x201c;But do you remember what else he always says? &#x2018;I can solve any mystery and be home in time to help Mom with dinner.&#x2019; He&#x2019;s a very good son.&#x201d; <br><br>It was a cold, rainy December night. Cam and her mother were on their way to school. It was the night of the yearly book fair. Jim E. Winter, the author of Cam&#x2019;s favorite books, the My Name Is Blake Mysteries, would be there. <br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s so difficult to drive in this weather,&#x201d; Mrs. Jansen said, and leaned forward. &#x201c;With all this rain and the cold, it&#x2019;s hard to see out. The car windows are all fogged up.&#x201d; <br><br>Cam&#x2019;s mother was stopped at a traffic light. She took a tissue and wiped the inside of the front window. <br><br>&#x201c;Did you ever see a picture of Jim E. Winter?&#x201d; she asked Cam. <br><br>&#x201c;Yes. There&#x2019;s one on the back of each of his books.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;I bet there&#x2019;s no fog on your memory,&#x201d; Mrs. Jansen said. &#x201c;Tell me what he looks like.&#x201d; <br><br>Cam closed her eyes. She said, &#x201c;Click!&#x201d; Then Cam said, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m looking at a picture of Jim E. Winter. He&#x2019;s really young. He has a dark bushy mustache and lots of dark wavy hair.&#x201d; <br><br>The light changed to green. <br><br>Mrs. Jansen drove slowly. <br><br>Cam said, &#x201c;In the picture he&#x2019;s wearing a polka-dotted bow tie and a striped shirt.&#x201d; <br><br>Cam has what people call a photographic memory. She remembers just about everything she&#x2019;s seen. It&#x2019;s as if she has a camera and a file of pictures in her head. <br><br>Cam said, &#x201c;Click!&#x201d; again. <br><br>&#x201c;On the cover beneath the picture,&#x201d; Cam said with her eyes still closed, &#x201c;is lots of information. It says, &#x2018;Jim E. Winter was once a police detective. He&#x2019;s written more than one hundred books. He lives near a forest and has a dog named Jake.&#x2019;&#x201d; <br><br>When Cam wants to remember something she&#x2019;s seen, she closes her eyes and says, &#x201c;Click!&#x201d; Cam says it&#x2019;s the sound her mental camera makes. <br><br>Cam&#x2019;s real name is Jennifer, but when people found out about her amazing memory, they called her &#x201c;The Camera.&#x201d; Soon &#x201c;The Camera&#x201d; became just &#x201c;Cam.&#x201d; <br><br>Mrs. Jansen was just about to turn onto the school&#x2019;s front drive. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re finally here!&#x201d; Mrs. Jansen said. &#x201c;And I&#x2019;m glad. It&#x2019;s not easy driving in this rain.&#x201d; <br><br>Cam opened her eyes. <br><br>&#x201c;Mom! Be careful!&#x201d; Cam said. &#x201c;Someone is walking just ahead.&#x201d; <br><br>Mrs. Jansen stepped on the car&#x2019;s brakes. She waited for the man to cross the road. Then she drove past the front of the school to the side parking lot. <br><br>&#x201c;Button your coat,&#x201d; Mrs. Jansen told Cam when she stopped the car. &#x201c;Put on your rain hat.&#x201d; <br><br>Mrs. Jansen took an umbrella from the backseat. She opened it. Then she and Cam hurried into the school. <br><br>There was a large mat by the door. Cam and her mother wiped their shoes. <br><br>A sign directed them to hang their coats in room 17. Mrs. Jansen closed her umbrella. She and Cam hung their coats, hats, and umbrella in room 17. <br><br>Beth Kane and her father were in the room, too. <br><br>&#x201c;Hi, Cam,&#x201d; Beth said. <br><br>&#x201c;Hello,&#x201d; Beth&#x2019;s father said, and shook Cam&#x2019;s hand. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s nice to see you again.&#x201d; <br><br>Cam smiled. &#x201c;Thanks.&#x201d; <br><br>Mr. Kane shook Mrs. Jansen&#x2019;s hand. <br><br>&#x201c;Your daughter is amazing,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;You must be so proud of her.&#x201d; <br><br>Mrs. Jansen smiled. &#x201c;And Cam has told me how nice and smart Beth is.&#x201d; <br><br>Then, as they were about to leave room 17, Danny and his parents entered the school. <br><br>&#x201c;Hey, there&#x2019;s Cam Jansen,&#x201d; Danny told his parents. &#x201c;She&#x2019;s the clicking girl.

Here&#x2019;s one: What do you get from nervous hens?&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;I know that one,&#x201d; Danny said, and laughed. &#x201c;The answer is &#x2018;scrambled eggs.&#x2019;&#x201d; Then Danny asked his father, &#x201c;Do you know Snow White&#x2019;s father&#x2019;s name? It&#x2019;s Egg White. Now the yolk is on you, Dad. Do you get it? The yolk is on you.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s enough jokes,&#x201d; Danny&#x2019;s mother said. &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s just hang up our coats.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;Wow,&#x201d; Beth said as she, Cam, and their parents walked into the hall. &#x201c;Danny&#x2019;s father tells bad jokes, too.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;Welcome,&#x201d; Dr. Prell, the school&#x2019;s principal, said. &#x201c;We have books for everyone. The book fair is in the gym.&#x201d; <br><br>The doors to the gym were open. Cam, Beth, and their parents went in. They stood there for a moment and looked at the many tables. On each was a pile of books and a sign so people would know what kind of books were on the table. <br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m looking for history books,&#x201d; Mrs. Jansen told Cam. &#x201c;You can look by yourself, but please don&#x2019;t leave this room.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;I want to meet Jim E. Winter,&#x201d; Cam said. <br><br>Beth said, &#x201c;Me, too. I love his mysteries.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;Stay with Cam,&#x201d; Mr. Kane told his daughter. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m going to look at the biographies.&#x201d; <br><br>Children and their parents were looking at books. There were small children, too, running between and under the tables. <br><br>&#x201c;There he is,&#x201d; Beth said, and pointed. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s in the back of the gym, right by the wall.&#x201d; <br><br>Cam looked across the gym. An old bald man with a white bushy mustache was sitting by a table at the far end of the gym. A long line of children were waiting for him to sign their books. <br><br>&#x201c;That man is bald! That can&#x2019;t be Jim E. Winter,&#x201d; Cam said. &#x201c;I saw a picture of him with dark, wavy hair and a dark mustache.&#x201d; <br><br>Beth said, &#x201c;You must have looked at an old picture of him.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; Cam said. &#x201c;It must have been a very old picture.&#x201d; <br><br>Cam looked at the many people waiting to meet Jim E. Winter. Each had a My Name Is Blake Mystery for him to sign. <br><br>&#x201c;Well,&#x201d; Cam said, &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t care what he looks like. I don&#x2019;t care how old he is.

Dr. Olitzky was ordained a rabbi by Hebrew Union College&#x2013;Jewish Institute of Religion, where he served the faculty and administration for fifteen years. In addition to the books he has co-authored with Dr. Kravitz, he is the author of numerous other books.The Song of Songs, known in Hebrew as Shir HaShirim gained importance as a sacred text because of its various interpretations rather than its plain meaning. The book is a collection of erotic love poetry whose sexual images are somewhat softened only by the amount of time that has passed between the compilation of the book and our day. It is a dialogue between two lovers that is marked by love songs, poetic dialogues, and monologues. Some just call it a love poem&#x2014;or a series of love poems&#x2014;that champions the physical expression of that love. The lovers who are the main characters in this book express their physical yearnings in frank terms and graphic sexual images, even as they communicate their more profound and enduring love for one another. Their love deepens their appreciation for the beautiful landscape that provides a context for their relationship and is, as well, exquisitely described. As a result, some of the most exceptional poetry in the Bible is contained in the Song of Songs. The transformation from love poetry to Holy Scripture (Kitvei HaKodesh) reflects both cultural development and a concomitant shifting of values.</p><h2>Murder in My Backyard</h2><p>No one in Heppleburn has a bad word to say about Alice Parry . . . . . .

Lee Gutkind collects twenty-five essays that flourished in this new turf, all originally published in the groundbreaking journal he founded,&nbsp;Creative Nonfiction, now in its tenth anniversary year.</p><p>Many of the writers here are crossing genres&#x2015;from poetry to fiction to nonfiction. Annie Dillard provides the introduction, while Gutkind discusses the creative and ethical parameters of this new genre. The selections themselves are broad and fascinating. Lauren Slater is a therapist in the institution where she was once a patient. John Edgar Wideman reacts passionately to the unjust murder of Emmett Till. Charles Simic contemplates raucous gatherings at his Uncle Boris's apartment, while John McPhee creates a rare, personal, album quilt of his own life. Terry Tempest Williams speaks on the decline of the prairie dog, and Madison Smartt Bell invades Haiti.&nbsp;</p></p><p><p><strong>Lee Gutkind</strong> is the founder and editor of the literary journal <em>Creative Nonfiction</em> and a pioneer in the field of narrative nonfiction.

She is a member of the Academy of Arts and Letters and has received fellowship grants from the John Simon Guggenheim Foundation and the National Endowment for the Arts. After living for five years in the Pacific Northwest, she now lives on the East Coast with her family.</p>*Starred Review* Mark Bowden, of <i>Black Hawk Down</i> (1999) fame, writes, "I think creative nonfiction is the major literary innovation of the last half century," a claim with which Gutkind, a tireless advocate for the form, wholeheartedly agrees. So committed to the genre is writer, teacher, and editor Gutkind, he founded the literary journal <i>Creative Nonfiction</i> and now celebrates its phenomenal first decade by collecting 25 of its best essays. The result is an electrifying anthology that covers the creative nonfiction universe from the personal essay to nature writing, literary journalism, and science writing. Each superb piece is followed by a writer's statement, and the book itself is introduced by a master of the form, Annie Dillard, whose "Notes for Young Writers" will galvanize all readers no matter their age or writing experience. Graced with memorable essays by such diverse writers as Diane Ackerman, Phillip Lopate, John McPhee, Richard Rodriguez, Floyd Skloot, John Edgar Wideman, and Terry Tempest Williams--writers who contemplate everything from creativity to race, the birth of a child, childhood memories, brain damage, and prairie dogs--this stellar volume will stand as an exciting and defining creative nonfiction primer. <i>Donna Seaman</i><br><i>Copyright ï¿½ American Library Association.

I was gazï¿½ing out my second-floor office window down at Berkeley Street, eating a cinnamon donut and drinking coffee with a little milk and sugar. The girl looked lost among the businesspeople and tourï¿½ists hustling along the icy sidewalks. She wore a pink Boston Red Sox cap and an oversized down parka with a fur collar, and stared up at the numbers on the office buildings where Berkeley intersects Boylston.</p><p>When she stopped at my building, she folded up a piece of paper and crossed the street with a lot of purpose. I had an open box of donuts and an uncashed check on my desk from Cone, Oakes. I&#x2019;d done a little work for Rita Fiore and had been paid handsomely.</p><p>The winter had been dark, bleak, and endless, but sometime in the last hour I had actually seen the sun. My computer was playing Helen Forrest singing with the Harry James Orchestra. Life was full of promise.</p><p>I had a bite of donut just as I heard the knock on the door.</p><p>I opened it.</p><p>&#x201c;You Spenser?&#x201d; asked the girl in the pink Red Sox cap.</p><p>&#x201c;The one and only.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;People say you&#x2019;re tough,&#x201d; she said.</p><p>&#x201c;Did they mention handsome and witty?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That you aren&#x2019;t afraid to use a gun.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Only when my feelings get hurt.&#x201d;</p><p>Her accent was South Boston, maybe Dorchester. Henry Higï¿½gins could have told me her exact address. I figured her for fifteen or sixteen. She stood about five- foot- five with straight reddish brown hair spilling from the Sox cap. Her eyes were green and very large, made slightly ridiculous with heavy eyeliner.</p><p>&#x201c;You really a private investigator?&#x201d; she asked.</p><p>&#x201c;Says so on the door.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And you didn&#x2019;t get your license from the Internet or anyï¿½thing?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Were you a cop or something?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Or something.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Thrown off the force for drinking?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Police brutality?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Then why aren&#x2019;t you a cop now?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t play well with others,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Would you like to come in?&#x201d;</p><p>She peered around me into my office, checking out my desk, two file cabinets, and the couch where Pearl slept when it was take-your-dog-to-work day. I extended my hand toward my guest chair and sat behind my desk. She joined me.</p><p>The girl had a full face with ruddy cheeks, a couple of moles on the right side. A cute kid if she&#x2019;d sit up straight. But she slouched into her chair and nervously toyed with a Saint Christopher medal.</p><p>&#x201c;Who busted your nose?&#x201d; she asked.</p><p>&#x201c;Jersey Joe Walcott,&#x201d; I said.</p><p>&#x201c;Who&#x2019;s he?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Former heavyweight champ,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Before your time.&#x201d;</p><p>I pushed the box of donuts toward her. She looked down at my carefully chosen assortment. Then she looked back at me, still playing with the medal, and shook her head. I let the silence hang there for a moment. I figured if I waited long enough, she might tell me why she was in need of my services. After a long pause, she did.</p><p>&#x201c;Somebody killed my mom.&#x201d;</p><p>I took a deep breath and leaned forward. &#x201c;When?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Four years ago,&#x201d; she said.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I want to find the bastards.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Okay.&#x201d; I nodded. &#x201c;Why now?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Nobody listens to kids,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m older now. You do this kind of stuff , right?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m good at making people listen,&#x201d; I said.</p><p>&#x201c;How much do you charge?&#x201d;</p><p>I told her the usual rate. She began to dig through her pockets, pulling out five crumpled twenties and a ten, flattening the cash on my desktop. &#x201c;Will this get you started?&#x201d;</p><p>I glanced down at the money and again nudged the box of donuts her way. This time she accepted, choosing a chocolate-frosted. I complimented her choice. Giving away a whole donut was a major philanthropic gesture. I hoped she appreciated it.</p><p>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s your name?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Mattie Sullivan.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You take the Red Line into the city, Miss Sullivan?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;How&#x2019;d you know that?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I am a trained investigator.&#x201d;</p><p>I drank some coffee. I pulled a yellow legal pad and a pen from my left desk drawer. Ever the professional. &#x201c;Why don&#x2019;t you tell me what happened.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;They left her up on The Point,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;By U Mass, where they tore down all those old buildings. You know?&#x201d;</p><p>I nodded.</p><p>&#x201c;She was stabbed to death.&#x201d;</p><p>I nodded some more. I took some notes.</p><p>&#x201c;She&#x2019;d been raped,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;They think.&#x201d;</p><p>Her face showed little emotion, telling the story as if she&#x2019;d read it in the newspaper.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m very sorry,&#x201d; I said.</p><p>&#x201c;That was a long time ago.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;How old are you now?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Fourteen.&#x201d;</p><p>I turned my chair as I listened and could see the morning traffic on Berkeley. People continued to make their way down the sideï¿½walk as an MBTA bus passed, churning dirty slush in its wake.</p><p>&#x201c;What did the police say?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;They arrested this guy the next day,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Mickey Green. He&#x2019;s doing life at Cedar Junction.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And you don&#x2019;t think he did it?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I know he didn&#x2019;t.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Why?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Mickey is a screwup, but he&#x2019;s a good guy, you know?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Not much to go on,&#x201d; I said.</p><p>&#x201c;I saw her with a couple men that night,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;I saw them snatch her up and push her into the back of a car. She wasn&#x2019;t with Mickey. Mickey wasn&#x2019;t with her that whole night.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Who were they?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You gonna do this?&#x201d; she asked.</p><p>&#x201c;Maybe.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;These are real mean guys.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Okay.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And young, too.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c; &#x2018;O Youth! For years so many and sweet.&#x2019; &#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re an older guy. I&#x2019;m just sayin&#x2019;.&#x201d;</p><p>I tried not to take offense. I was fourteen once.</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know their full names,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;They just go by Pepper and Moon. Coupla shitbag drug dealers in the neighborhood.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What neighborhood?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve lived in the Mary Ellen McCormack my whole freakin&#x2019; life.&#x201d;</p><p>The McCormack was down at the bottom of South Boston, close to Dorchester, a tough old brick housing project that headï¿½lined a lot of shooting stories in the Globe.</p><p>&#x201c;The last time I saw Pepper was six months ago. I don&#x2019;t know about Moon.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Why not go back to the cops?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I did. A bunch of times.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What&#x2019;d they say?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That Mickey Green is a true douchebag and got what he deï¿½served. One time they gave me a pat on the head and a card about some shrink so I could &#x2018;talk about my trauma.&#x2019; After a couple of years, they just stopped calling me back.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You can vouch for Mickey&#x2019;s character?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;He was friends with my mother,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;They used to drink together at Four Green Fields. He helped her when our pipes would bust or if she needed groceries.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Tell me what you saw that night.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I saw her come into my room,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;d put my baby sisters down to sleep after dinner, and my mom came in and went through my drawers for money. She didn&#x2019;t know I saw her, but I was pissed.</p><p>I followed her outside and was gonna yell at her, but before I could, I seen Pepper and Moon grab her and drag her to their car. They threw her in the backseat. They were yelling back and forth, but I couldn&#x2019;t hear what they were sayin&#x2019;. Or what she was sayin&#x2019;. One of the guys hit her. It was a real mess.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry.&#x201d; There wasn&#x2019;t much else to say.</p><p>Mattie dropped her head and nodded. She rubbed her hands together. Her nails, which were painted with black polish, had been bitten to stubs. She didn&#x2019;t look like she&#x2019;d smiled since elemenï¿½tary school. Her parka had seen a lot of winters; her wrists peeked out from the blackened sleeves, buttons barely hanging on. The knees of her jeans had been patched.</p><p>&#x201c;Where are your sisters now?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;We all live with my grandmother.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Your mother&#x2019;s mom?&#x201d;</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>&#x201c;Dad?&#x201d;</p><p>Mattie rolled her eyes.</p><p>&#x201c;So four years later, you just decide to set this straight?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Me and Mickey been talking about it.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You visit him in jail?&#x201d; I asked. I leaned forward and made some notes.</p><p>&#x201c;He started writing me letters and sending me birthday cards and crap,&#x201d; she said. Mattie ran her finger under her reddened nose. &#x201c;He kept on saying how sorry he was and all, and that he would&#x2019;ve never hurt my ma. And so I wrote him back and said, I know. I told him about Pepper and Moon. I said I tried to tell but no one was listening. Jesus, I was only ten.&#x201d;</p><p>She studied my face as I thought about what she&#x2019;d said. I figured she was seeing the chiseled features of a man she could respect. She finally rolled her eyes and went for the money. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re not the only tough guy in Boston,&#x201d; she said.</p><p>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s another,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;But we work as a team.&#x201d;</p><p>She left the money and looked at me with those sad, tough eyes. Her shoulders slouched some more, and she dug her hands deeper into the pockets of her old parka. The pink hat looked shabby. She reminded me a lot of Paul Giacomin when I&#x2019;d first met him. Nobody in his corner.</p><p>&#x201c;Anyone else see your mom taken by these guys?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know,&#x201d; Mattie said. &#x201c;Nobody wants to talk about it. And nobody wants to help.&#x201d;</p><p>She blinked hard, and rubbed her eyes with her tiny, balled-up fists. She sighed. &#x201c;This was a stupid idea.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Wait a second.&#x201d;</p><p>She stood up, eyes lingering on me. I pushed the money back across my desk.</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re in luck, Mattie Sullivan,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m running a special this week.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s the special?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Investigative services in exchange for more of these,&#x201d; I said, holding up a donut.</p><p>&#x201c;Are you shitting me?&#x201d; she asked.</p><p>&#x201c;I shit you not.&#x201d;</p></p><h2>Fargo Rock City: A Heavy Metal Odyssey in Rural North Dakota</h2><p>Empirically proving that&#x2014;no matter where you are&#x2014;kids wanna rock, this is Chuck Klosterman's hilrious memoir of growing up as a shameless metalhead in Wyndmere, North Dakotoa (population: 498).<br><br>With a voice like Ace Frehley's guitar, Klosterman hacks his way through hair-band history, beginning with that fateful day in 1983 when his older brother brought home Mï¿½tley Crï¿½e's <i>Shout at the Devil.</i> The fifth-grade Chuck wasn't quite ready to rock&#x2014;his hair was too short and his farm was too quiet&#x2014;but he still found a way to bang his nappy little head. Before the journey was over, he would slow-dance to Poison, sleep innocently beneath satanic pentagrams, lust for Lita Ford, and get ridiculously intellectual about Guns N' Roses. C'mon and feel his noize.</p><p>Chuck Klosterman is the bestselling author of many books of nonfiction (including <i>Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs, I Wear the Black Hat, Fargo Rock City </i>and <i>Chuck Klosterman X</i>) and two novels (<i>Downtown Owl </i>and <i>The Visible Man</i>). He has written for <i>The New York Times</i>, <i>The Washington Post</i>, <i>GQ</i>, <i>Esquire</i>, <i>Spin</i>, <i>The Guardian</i>, <i>The Believer,</i> <i>Billboard</i>, <i>The A.V. Club</i>, and ESPN. Klosterman served as the Ethicist for <i>The New York Times Magazine </i>for three years, and was an original founder of the website Grantland with Bill Simmons.<b>Chapter One: October 26, 1983</b><br><br><b>The worldwide release of Mï¿½tley Crï¿½e's<br><br><i>Shout at the Devil</i>.</b><br><br>It's easy for me to recall the morning I was absorbed into the cult of heavy metal. As is so often the case with this sort of thing, it was all my brother's fault.<br><br>As a painfully typical fifth-grader living in the rural Midwest, my life was boring, just like it was supposed to be. I lived five miles south of a tiny town called Wyndmere, where I spent a lot of time drinking Pepsi in the basement and watching syndicated episodes of Laverne &amp; Shirley and Diff'rent Strokes. I killed the rest of my free time listening to Y-94, the lone Top 40 radio station transmitted out of Fargo, sixty-five miles to the north (in the horizontal wasteland of North Dakota, radio waves travel forever). This was 1983, which -- at least in Fargo -- was the era of mainstream "new wave" pop (although it seems the phrase "new wave" was only used by people who never actually listened to that kind of music). The artists who appear exclusively on today's "Best of the '80s" compilations were the dominant attractions: Madness, Culture Club, Falco, the Stray Cats, German songstress Nena, and -- of course -- Duran Duran (the economic backbone of Friday Night Videos' cultural economy). The most popular song in my elementary school was Eddy Grant's "Electric Avenue," but that was destined to be replaced by Prince's "Let's Go Crazy" (which would subsequently be replaced by "Raspberry Beret").<br><br>Obviously, popular music was not in a state of revolution, or turbulence, or even contrived horror. The only exposure anyone in Wyndmere had to punk rock was an episode of Quincy that focused on the rising danger of slam dancing (later, we found out that Courtney Love had made a cameo appearance in that particular program, but that kind of trivia wouldn't be worth knowing until college). There were five hundred people in my hometown, and exactly zero of them knew about Motorhead, Judas Priest, or anything loud and British. Rock historians typically describe this as the period where hard rock moved "underground," and that's the perfect metaphor; the magma of heavy metal was thousands of miles below the snow-packed surface of Wyndmere, North Dakota.<br><br>Was this some kind of unadulterated tranquillity? Certainly not. As I look back, nothing seems retroactively utopian about Rick Springfield, even though others might try to tell you differently. Whenever people look back on their grammar school days, they inevitably insist that they remember feeling "safe" or "pure" or "hungry for discovery." Of course, the people who say those things are lying (or stupid, or both). It's revisionist history; it's someone trying to describe how it felt to be eleven by comparing it to how it feels to be thirty-one, and it has nothing to do with how things really were. When you actually are eleven, your life always feels exhaustively normal, because your definition of "normal" is whatever is going on at the moment. You view the entire concept of "life" as your life, because you have nothing else to measure it against. Unless your mom dies or you get your foot caught in the family lawn mower, every part of childhood happens exactly as it should. It's the only way things can happen.<br><br>That changed when my older brother returned from the army. He was on leave from Fort Benning in Georgia, and he had two cassettes in his duffel bag (both of which he would forget to take back with him when he returned to his base). The first, <i>Sports,</i> by Huey Lewis and the News, was already a known quantity ("I Want a New Drug" happened to be the song of the moment on Y-94). However, the second cassette would redirect the path of my life: <i>Shout at the Devil</i> by Mï¿½tley Crï¿½e.<br><br>As clichï¿½ as it now seems, I was wholly disturbed by the <i>Shout at the Devil</i> cover. I clearly remember thinking, Who the fuck are these guys? Who the fuck are these guys? And -- more importantly -- Are these guys even guys? The blond one looked like a chick, and one of the members was named "Nikki." Fortunately, my sister broached this issue seconds after seeing the album cover, and my brother (eleven years my senior) said, "No, they're all guys. They're really twisted, but it's pretty good music." When my brother was a senior in high school, he used to drive me to school; I remembered that he always listened to 8-tracks featuring Meat Loaf, Molly Hatchet, and what I later recognized to be old Van Halen. Using that memory as my reference point, I assumed I had a vague idea what Mï¿½tley Crï¿½e might sound like.<br><br>Still, I didn't listen to it. I put Huey Lewis into my brother's trendy Walkman (another first) and fast-forwarded to all the songs I already knew. Meanwhile, I read the liner notes to <i>Shout at the Devil.</i> It was like stumbling across a copy of Anton LaVey's <i>Satanic Bible</i> (which -- of course -- was a book I had never heard of or could even imagine existing). The band insisted that "This album was recorded on Foster's Lager, Budweiser, Bombay Gin, lots of Jack Daniel's, Kahlua and Brandy, Quakers and Krell, and Wild Women!" And they even included an advisory: Caution: This record may contain backwards messages. What the hell did that mean? Why would anyone do that? I wondered if my brother (or anyone in the world, for that matter) had a tape player that played cassettes backward.<br><br>The day before I actually listened to the album, I told my friends about this awesome new band I had discovered. Eleven years later I would become a rock critic and do that sort of thing all the time, so maybe this was like vocational training. Everyone seemed mildly impressed that the Crï¿½e had a song named "Bastard." "God Bless the Children of the Beast" also seemed promising.<br><br>Clearly, this was a cool band. Clearly, I was an idiot and so were all my friends. It's incredible to look back and realize how effectively the Mï¿½tley image machine operated. It didn't occur to anyone that we were going to listen to Mï¿½tley Crï¿½e for the same reason we all watched <i>KISS Meets the Phantom of the Park</i> in 1978, when we were first-graders who liked Ace Frehley for the same reasons we liked Spider-Man.<br><br>Yet I would be lying if I said the only thing we dug about Mï¿½tley Crï¿½e was their persona. Without a doubt, their image was the catalyst for the attraction -- but that wasn't the entire equation. I say this because I also remember sitting on my bed on a Sunday afternoon and playing <i>Shout at the Devil</i> for the first time. This may make a sad statement about my generation (or perhaps just myself), but <i>Shout at the Devil</i> was my <i>Sgt. Pepper's.</i><br><br>The LP opens with a spoken-word piece called "In the Beginning." The track doesn't make a whole lot of sense and would seem laughable on any record made after 1992, but I was predictably (and stereotypically) bewitched. The next three songs would forever define my image of what glam metal was supposed to sound like: "Shout at the Devil," "Looks That Kill," and the seminal "Bastard." Although the instrumental "God Bless the Children of the Beast" kind of wasted my precious time, the last song on side one was "Helter Skelter," which I immediately decided was the catchiest tune on the record (fortunately, I was still a decade away from understanding irony). I was possessed, just as Tipper Gore always feared; I had no choice but to listen to these songs again. And again. And again.<br><br>It was three months before I took the time to listen to side two.<br><br>It can safely be said that few rock historians consider <i>Shout at the Devil</i> a "concept album." In fact, few rock historians have ever considered <i>Shout at the Devil</i> in any way whatsoever (the only exception might be when J. D. Considine reviewed it for <i>Rolling Stone</i> and compared it to disco-era KISS). Bassist Nikki Sixx wrote virtually every song on <i>Shout,</i> and he probably didn't see it as a concept record either. But for someone (read: me) who had never really listened to albums before -- I had only been exposed to singles on the radio -- <i>Shout at the Devil</i> took on a conceptual quality that Yes would have castrated themselves to achieve. Like all great '80s music, it was inadvertently post-modern: The significance of <i>Shout at the Devil</i> had nothing to do with the concepts it introduced; its significance was the concept of what it literally was.<br><br>I realize this argument could be made by anyone when they discuss their first favorite album. My sister probably saw epic ideas in the Thompson Twins. That's the nature of an adolescent's relationship with rock 'n' roll. Sixx himself has described Aerosmith as "my Beatles." Using that logic, Mï¿½tley Crï¿½e was "my Aerosmith," who (along these same lines) would still ultimately be "my Beatles."<br><br>Yet this personal relationship is only half the story, and not even the half that matters. There is another reason to look at the Crï¿½e with slightly more seriousness (the operative word here being "slightly"). As we all know, '80s glam metal came from predictable sources: the aforementioned Aerosmith (seemingly every glam artist's favorite band), early and midperiod KISS (duh), Alice Cooper (but not so much musically), Slade (at least according to Quiet Riot), T. Rex (more than logic would dictate), Blue Cheer (supposedly), and -- of course -- Black Sabbath and Led Zeppelin (although those two bands had just as much effect on Pearl Jam, Soundgarden, and all the Sasquatch Rockers who would rise from the Pacific Northwest when metal started to flounder). In other words, this wasn't groundbreaking stuff, and no one is trying to argue otherwise. Sonically and visually, heavy metal was (and is) an unabashedly derivative art form.<br><br>But those sonic thefts are only half the equation, and maybe even less than that. We have to consider when this happened. The decade of the 1980s is constantly misrepresented by writers who obviously did not have the typical teen experience. If you believe unofficial Gen X spokesman Douglas Coupland (a title I realize he never asked for), every kid in the 1980s laid awake at night and worried about nuclear war. I don't recall the fear of nuclear apocalypse being an issue for me, for anyone I knew, or for any kid who wasn't trying to win an essay contest. The imprint Ronald Reagan placed on Children of the '80s had nothing to do with the escalation of the Cold War; it had more to do with the fact that he was the only president any of us could really remember (most of my information on Jimmy Carter had been learned through Real People, and -- in retrospect -- I suspect a bias in its news reporting).<br><br>In the attempt to paint the 1980s as some glossy, capitalistic wasteland, contemporary writers tend to ignore how unremarkable things actually were. John Hughes movies like <i>The Breakfast Club</i> and <i>Sixteen Candles</i> were perfect period pieces for their era -- all his characters were obsessed with overwrought, self-centered personal problems, exactly like the rest of us. I suppose all the '80s films about the raging arms race are culturally relevant, much in the same way that Godzilla films are interesting reflections on the atomic age. But those films certainly weren't unsettling to anyone who didn't know better. <i>WarGames</i> and the TV movie <i>The Day After</i> were more plausible than something like <i>Planet of the Apes,</i> but -- quite frankly -- every new movie seemed a little more plausible than the stuff made before we were born. Anything could happen and probably would (sooner or later), but nothing would really change. Nobody seemed too shocked over the abundance of nuclear warheads the Soviets pointed at us; as far as I could tell, we were supposed to be on the brink of war 24/7. That was part of being an American. I remember when <i>Newsweek</i> ran a cover story introducing a new breed of adults called "Yuppies," a class of people who wore Nikes to the office and were money-hungry egomaniacs. No fifteen-year-old saw anything unusual about this. I mean, wouldn't that be normal behavior? The single biggest influence on our lives was the inescapable sameness of everything, which is probably true for most generations.<br><br>Jefferson Morley makes a brilliant point about inflation in his 1988 essay "Twentysomething": "For us, everything seemed normal. I remember wondering why people were surprised that prices were going up. I thought, That's what prices did." Consider that those sentiments come from a guy who was already in high school during Watergate -- roughly the same year I was born. To be honest, I don't know if I've ever been legitimately shocked by anything, even as a third-grader in 1981. That was the year John Hinckley shot Ronald Reagan, and I wasn't surprised at all (in fact, it seemed to me that presidential assassinations didn't happen nearly as often as one would expect). From what I could tell, the world had always been a deeply underwhelming place; my generation inherited this paradigm, and it was perfectly fine with me (both then and now).<br><br>Mï¿½tley Crï¿½e was made to live in this kind of world. <i>Shout at the Devil</i> injected itself into a social vortex of jaded pragmatism; subsequently, it was the best album my friends and I had ever heard. We never scoffed at the content as "contrived shock rock." By 1983, that idea was the norm. Elvis Costello has questioned whether or not '80s glam metal should even be considered rock 'n' roll, because he thinks it's a "facsimile" of what legitimate artists already did in the past. What he fails to realize is that no one born after 1970 can possibly appreciate any creative element in rock 'n' roll: By 1980, there was no creativity left. The freshest ideas in pop music's past twenty years have come out of rap, and that genre is totally based on recycled, bastardized riffs. Clever facsimiles are all we really expect.<br><br>The problem with the current generation of rock academics is that they remember when rock music seemed new. It's impossible for them to relate to those of us who have never known a world where rock 'n' roll wasn't everywhere, all the time. They remind me of my eleventh-grade history teacher -- a guy who simply could not fathom why nobody in my class seemed impressed by the Apollo moon landing. As long as I can remember, all good rock bands told lies about themselves and dressed like freaks; that was part of what defined being a "rock star." Mï¿½tley Crï¿½e was a little more overt about following this criteria, but that only made me like them immediately.<br><br>In fact, I loved Mï¿½tley Crï¿½e with such reckless abandon that I didn't waste my time learning much about the band. I consistently mispronounced Sixx's name wrong (I usually called him "Nikki Stixx"), and I got Tommy Lee and Mick Mars mixed up for almost a year.<br><br>Until 1992, I didn't even know that the cover art for the vinyl version of <i>Shout at the Devil</i> was a singular, bad-ass pentagram that was only visible when the album was held at a forty-five-degree angle. The reason this slipped under my radar was because <i>Shout at the Devil</i> was released in 1983, a period when the only people who were still buying vinyl were serious music fans. Obviously, serious music fans weren't buying Mï¿½tley Crï¿½e. I've never even seen Mï¿½tley Crï¿½e on vinyl; I used to buy most of my music at a Pamida in Wahpeton, ND -- the only town within a half hour's drive that sold rock 'n' roll -- and the last piece of vinyl I recall noticing in the racks was the soundtrack to <i>Grease.</i> The rest of us got <i>Shout at the Devil</i> on tape. The cassette's jacket featured the four band members in four different photographs, apparently taken on the set for the "Looks That Kill" video (which is probably the most ridiculous video ever made, unless you count videos made in Ca...</p><h2>Beloved (Everyman&#39;s Library)</h2><p><p>Winner of the Pulitzer Prize, Toni Morrison&#x2019;s <i>Beloved</i> is a spellbinding and dazzlingly innovative portrait of a woman haunted by the past.</p><p>Sethe was born a slave and escaped to Ohio, but eighteen years later she is still not free.

Between 1966 and 1968, she published three novels to critical acclaim:&nbsp;<i>The Cat Who Could Read Backwards, The Cat Who Ate Danish Modern</i>,&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>The Cat Who Turned On and Off</i>.&nbsp; In 1966,&nbsp;the<i> New York Times</i>&nbsp;labeled Braun, &#x201c;the new detective of the year.&#x201d; Then, for reasons unknown, the rising mystery author disappeared from the publishing scene. It wasn&#x2019;t until 1986 that Berkley Publishing Group reintroduced Braun to the public with the publication of an original paperback,&nbsp;<i>The Cat Who Saw Red</i>. Within two years, Berkley released four new novels in paperback and reprinted the three mysteries from the sixties. Since then, G.P. Putnam&#x2019;s Sons has published seventeen additional novels in the Cat Who series. Braun passed away in 2011.Van Patten&#39;s narration is perfectly paced to reflect the backwoods antics of newspaperman Qwilleran and his detective felines, Koko and Yum-Yum. Patten distinguishes well among the many characters, especially the yowls and meows of the precocious Siamese. His characterization of the elegantly simple Qwilleran is superb. The abridgment handles the quirky storyline well but misses some of the folksy humor of Moose County. The overall effect is enjoyable and clever. A.L.M.

Parker wondered if at some point every person reached an age where he or she prayed for a pause to progress, although often it seemed to him that progress was just so much window dressing, because people tended to remain much as they had always been. Still, he wished folks would occasionally leave the windows as they were, for a while at least.<br> <br>The presence of the bar was indicated solely by a sign on the sidewalk, required because the establishment was set back from the street on the first floor of an old warehouse, and would otherwise have been difficult, if not impossible, to find.<br> <br>Perhaps this was why it appealed to Louis. Given the opportunity, Louis might even have dispensed with the sign entirely, and supplied details of the bar&#x2019;s location only to those whose company he was prepared to tolerate, which meant that maybe five people in the world would have been burdened with the responsibility of keeping it in business.<br> <br>No such tactics were required on this night to offer Louis the peace he desired. Only a handful of customers were present: a young couple at a corner table, two older men eating burgers at the bar, and Parker and Louis. Parker had just been served a glass of wine. Louis was drinking a martini, very dry. It might not have been his first, but with Louis it was always difficult to tell.<br> <br>&#x201c;How is he?&#x201d; Parker asked.<br> <br>&#x201c;Confused. In pain.&#x201d;<br> <br>Days earlier, Louis&#x2019;s partner, Angel, had been relieved of a tumor the size of an egg in a New York hospital, along with a length of his large intestine. The procedure hadn&#x2019;t gone entirely well, and the recuperation period would be difficult, involving chemotherapy sessions every three weeks for the next two years, while the threat of ancillary growths remained. The call to inform Parker of Louis&#x2019;s presence in the city of Portland had therefore come as a surprise. Parker had intended to travel down to New York to visit Angel and offer Louis whatever support he could. Instead, Louis was sitting in a Portland bar while his partner lay in a hospital bed, medicated up to his eyeballs.<br> <br>But then, Louis and Angel were unique unto themselves: criminals, lovers, killers of men, and crusaders for a cause that had no name beyond Parker&#x2019;s own. They kept to their particular rhythm as they walked through life.<br> <br>&#x201c;And how are you?&#x201d; asked Parker.<br> <br>&#x201c;Angry,&#x201d; said Louis. &#x201c;Concerned and frightened, but mostly angry.&#x201d;<br> <br>Parker said nothing, but sipped his wine and listened to a ship calling in the night.<br> <br>&#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t expect to be back here so soon,&#x201d; Louis continued, as though in answer to Parker&#x2019;s unvoiced question, &#x201c;but there were some things I needed from the condo. And anyway, the New York apartment just didn&#x2019;t feel right without Angel next to me. It was like the walls were closing in. How can that be? How can a place seem smaller when there&#x2019;s one person missing from it? Portland&#x2019;s different. It&#x2019;s less his place. So I visited with him this afternoon, then took a car straight to LaGuardia. I wanted to escape.&#x201d;<br> <br>He sipped his cocktail.<br> <br>&#x201c;And I can&#x2019;t go to the hospital every day. I hate seeing him that way.&#x201d; He turned to look at Parker. &#x201c;So talk to me about something else.&#x201d;<br> <br>Parker examined the world through the filter of his wineglass.<br> <br>&#x201c;The Fulcis are considering buying a bar,&#x201d; he said.<br> <br>Paulie and Tony Fulci were Portland&#x2019;s answer to Tweedledum and Tweedledee, assuming Tweedledum and Tweedledee were heavily&#x2014;if unsuccessfully&#x2014;medicated for psychosis, built like armored trucks, and prone to outbreaks of targeted violence that were often, but not always, the result of severe provocation, the Fulcis&#x2019; definition of which was fluid, and ranged from rudeness and poor parking to assault and attempted murder.<br> <br>Louis almost spat out his drink.<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re fucking kidding. They haven&#x2019;t told me anything about it.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Maybe they were afraid you might choke&#x2014;and not without justification.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;But a bar is a business. With patrons. You know, regular human beings.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Well, they&#x2019;re banned from almost every drinking hole in this city, with the exception of the Bear, and that&#x2019;s only because Dave Evans doesn&#x2019;t want to hurt their feelings. Also, they help keep bad elements at bay, although Dave sometimes struggles to imagine an element worse than the Fulcis themselves. But Paulie says that they&#x2019;re worried about falling into a rut, and they have some money from an old bequest that they&#x2019;re thinking of investing.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;A bequest? What kind of bequest?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Probably the kind made at gunpoint. Seems they&#x2019;ve been sitting on it for years.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Just letting it cool down a little, huh?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Cool down a lot.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;They planning on fronting this place themselves, or would they actually like to attract a clientele?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;They&#x2019;re looking for a stooge.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;They&#x2019;ll need to find someone crazier than they are.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I believe that&#x2019;s proving an obstacle to progress.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Would you front a bar run by the Fulcis?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;At least it would be guaranteed free of trouble.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No, it would be guaranteed free of outside trouble.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;If they manage to open, you&#x2019;ll be obliged to support them. They&#x2019;ll be very unhappy otherwise. You know how fond they are of you and Angel.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Which is your fault.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I simply facilitated an introduction.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Like rats facilitated the introduction of the plague.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Tut-tut.&#x201d;<br> <br>Louis finished his drink and raised his glass for another.<br> <br>&#x201c;You know,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;that news has cheered me up some.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I thought it might.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You working on anything?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Just some paper for Moxie. Routine stuff.&#x201d;<br> <br>Moxie Castin was one of Portland&#x2019;s more colorful legal figures. With his ill-fitting suits and huckster manner, Moxie appeared completely untrustworthy, but in Parker&#x2019;s experience only trustworthy individuals were prepared to embrace a livery that suggested the opposite. Moxie paid well and on time, which made him a rara avis not only in legal circles but in most other circles as well. Finally, Moxie was privy to most&#x2014;although not all&#x2014;of Parker&#x2019;s affairs, including the discreet arrangement whereby the Federal Bureau of Investigation paid a retainer into Parker&#x2019;s account each month in return for consultancy services. It was not a state of affairs of which Moxie unconditionally approved, although at least Parker also recognized it for the devil&#x2019;s bargain it was.<br> <br>&#x201c;You look tired for a man dealing with routine stuff,&#x201d; said Louis.<br> <br>&#x201c;I haven&#x2019;t been sleeping well.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Bad dreams?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not sure I can always tell the difference between dreams and reality. Waking sometimes seems as bad as sleeping.&#x201d;<br> <br>Parker was already recognizing signs of the onset of a depression that had shadowed him even in adolescence, but had begun to trouble him more deeply since the gun attack that almost killed him. He knew that soon he would have to seek seclusion. He would want&#x2014;even need&#x2014;to be alone, because it was at those times that his dead daughter most often appeared to him.<br> <br>&#x201c;Angel said something to me once.&#x201d;<br> <br>Parker waited, and it was as though Louis had heard his thoughts, or had glimpsed the flickering whiteness of a lost child in Parker&#x2019;s eyes.<br> <br>&#x201c;He said he thought you saw Jennifer, that she spoke to you.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Jennifer&#x2019;s dead.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;With respect, that&#x2019;s not the point.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Like I said, I find it hard to tell what are dreams and what are not.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You know, I don&#x2019;t think you find it hard at all.&#x201d;<br> <br>Slow time passed before Louis spoke again.<br> <br>&#x201c;I used to dream of my father.&#x201d;<br> <br>Parker knew that Louis&#x2019;s father had fallen into the hands of bigoted, violent men who hanged him from a tree before setting him alight. Many years later Louis returned for those responsible, and burned the tree on which his father had died.<br> <br>&#x201c;He would come to me in my sleep,&#x201d; said Louis, &#x201c;wreathed in fire, and his mouth would move as he tried to speak, except nothing ever came out, or nothing I could understand. I used to wonder what he was trying to say. In the end, I figured he was warning me. I think he was telling me not to go looking for vengeance, because he knew what I&#x2019;d become if I did.<br> <br>&#x201c;So I dreamed him, and I knew I was dreaming him, but when I woke I&#x2019;d smell him in the room, all shit and gasoline, all smoke and charred meat. I&#x2019;d tell myself I was imagining it, that these were all smells I knew from before, and the force of the dream was just tricking my mind into putting them together. But it was strong, so strong: it would be in my hair and on my skin for the rest of the day, and sometimes other folks picked up on it too. They&#x2019;d comment, and I wouldn&#x2019;t have an answer for them, or none they&#x2019;d want to hear, and maybe none I&#x2019;d want to hear either.<br> <br>&#x201c;It would frighten me. Frightened me for most of my life. Angel knew, but no one else. He smelled it on me, smelled it after my nightmares when I woke up sweating beside him in bed, and I didn&#x2019;t want to lie to him, because I&#x2019;ve never lied to him. So I told him, just like I&#x2019;m telling you, and he believed me, just like I know you believe me.<br> <br>&#x201c;My father doesn&#x2019;t come to me so much anymore, but when he does I&#x2019;m no longer troubled. You know why? Because of you. Because I&#x2019;ve seen things with you, experienced things that made me understand I wasn&#x2019;t crazy, and I wasn&#x2019;t alone. More than that, there&#x2019;s a consolation to it, to all of this. I think that&#x2019;s why I came up here tonight, and why I called you. If I lose Angel, I know I&#x2019;ll find him again. I&#x2019;ll tear this world apart before I do, and maybe I&#x2019;ll die burning like my father burned, but that won&#x2019;t be the end for Angel and me. He&#x2019;ll wait for me on the other side, and we&#x2019;ll go together into whatever waits. This I know because of you. I&#x2019;ve hurt a lot of people, some that didn&#x2019;t deserve what came to them and some that did, although the distinction meant nothing to me then, and doesn&#x2019;t mean a whole lot now. I could have questioned what I did, but I chose not to. I have blood on my hands, and I&#x2019;ll shed more before I&#x2019;m done with this life, but I&#x2019;ll shed it because I&#x2019;m following a different path, your path, and I&#x2019;ll sacrifice myself because I have to, because it&#x2019;s my reparation. In return, I&#x2019;ll be allowed to stay with Angel forever. That&#x2019;s the deal. You tell that to your daughter next time you see her. You tell her to bring it to her god.&#x201d;<br> <br>Parker stared hard at him.<br> <br>&#x201c;Just how many cocktails have you had?&#x201d;<br> <br>The stillness seemed to encompass the entire bar.

It&#x2019;s a shameful word, a word no one typically tries to own. Until now.<br> <br>Lidia Yuknavitch is a proud misfit. That wasn&#x2019;t always the case. It took Lidia a long time to not simply accept, but appreciate, her misfit status. Having flunked out of college twice (and maybe even a third time that she&#x2019;s not going to tell you about), with two epic divorces under her belt, an episode of rehab for drug use, and two stints in jail, she felt like she would never fit in. She was a hopeless misfit. She&#x2019;d failed as daughter, wife, mother, scholar&#x2014;and yet the dream of being a writer was stuck like &#x201c;a small sad stone&#x201d; in her throat.<br> <br>The feeling of not fitting in is universal. <i>The Misfit&#x2019;s Manifesto</i> is for misfits around the world&#x2014;the rebels, the eccentrics, the oddballs, and anyone who has ever felt like she was messing up. It&#x2019;s Lidia&#x2019;s love letter to all those who can&#x2019;t ever seem to find the &#x201c;right&#x201d; path. She won&#x2019;t tell you how to stop being a misfit&#x2014;quite the opposite. In her charming, poetic, funny, and frank style, Lidia will reveal why being a misfit is not something to overcome, but something to embrace. Lidia also encourages her fellow misfits not to be afraid of pursuing goals, how to stand up, how to ask for the things they want most. Misfits belong in the room, too, she reminds us, even if their path to that room is bumpy and winding. An important idea that transcends all cultures and countries, this book has created a brave and compassionate community for misfits, a place where everyone can belong.</p><p>Lidia Yuknavitch is the national bestselling author of the novels <i>The Book of Joan</i>, <i>The Small Backs of Children</i>, <i>Dora: A Headcase</i>, and the memoir <i>The Chronology of Water</i>.

Among the flames of the Hundred Years War, a sinister enemy awaits the fabled archer and mercenary soldier: a bloodthirsty Dominican Inquisitor who also seeks Christendom's most holy relic. But neither the horrors of the battlefield nor sadistic torture at the Inquisitor's hands can turn Thomas from his sworn mission. And his thirst for vengeance will never be quenched while the villainous black rider who destroyed everything he loved still lives. </p> <p> From internationally acclaimed <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author Bernard Cornwell comes the spellbinding second chapter in his Grail Quest&#x2014;the majestic epic adventure of duty, war, and destiny that began with <i>The Archer's Tale</i>. </p></p><p><i>Vagabond</i>, the second entry in Bernard Cornwell's Grail Quest series, has been eagerly anticipated by those who read the first book, and it doesn't disappoint. Thomas has managed to survive the battle of Crï¿½cy. Still nursing his wounds, he is dispatched by the king on a mission to look into the matter of his father's inheritance, which is obscurely connected to the Holy Grail. This most precious relic of the Christian faith is a much sought-after object, offering the power of total victory in war to its owner. But Thomas finds himself in the middle of a battle against an army invading the North of England, and other shadowy forces pursuing the grail are prepared to slaughter anyone who stands in their way. In the ruins of his birthplace, Thomas discovers more about his father, and a dangerous voyage to France brings him up against his cousin and arch-enemy, Count of Astarc Guy Vexville. The stage is set for a merciless showdown.<p> Thomas is a protagonist drawn quite as pithily as his much-loved predecessor, and the sheer verve of Cornwell's storytelling here is irresistible. We are plunged into a distant age: bloody, colourful and dangerous.

We are just absorbed in ourselves, that afternoon when he dies. Unseasonable heat. We squabble, as usual. Mother comes out on the terrace and puts a stop to it by raising her hand, a swift motion against the sky. Then we spend some time lying down with lengths of muslin over our faces, trying not to scream, and so he dies with none of us women bearing witness, none of us accompanying him.</p><p>It is possible we drove him away, that the energy escaped our bodies despite our attempts to stifle it and became a smog clinging around the house, the forest, the beach. That was where we last saw him. He put a towel on the ground and lay down parallel to the sea, flat on the sand. He was resting, letting sweat gather along his top lip, his bare head.</p><p>The interrogation begins at dinner when he fails to turn up. Mother pushes the food and plates from the table in her agitation, one sweep of the arm, and we search the endless rooms of the house. He is not in the kitchen, soaking fish in a tub of brine, or pulling up withered potatoes outside, inspecting the soil. He is not on the terrace at the top of the house, surveying the still surface of the pool three floors below, and he is certainly not in the pool itself, for the sound of his splashing is always violent enough to carry. He is not in the lounge, nor the ballroom, the piano untouched, the velvet curtains heavy with undisturbed dust. Moving up the staircase again, a spine through the centre of the house, we check our rooms individually, our bathrooms, though we know he will not be there. From our scattered formation we come together to search the garden, search deeper, sticking long branches into the pond&#x2019;s green murk. Eventually we are out on the beach and we realize one of the boats has gone too--a furrow in the sand where it has been pushed out.</p><p>For a moment we think he has gone for supplies, but then we remember he was not wearing the protective white suit, we did not do the leaving ceremony, and we look towards the rounded glow of the horizon, the air peach-ripe with toxicity. And Mother falls to her knees.</p><p>Our father had a big and difficult body. When he sat down, his swimming shorts rode up and exposed the whiteness of his thigh where it was usually covered. If you killed him, it would be like pushing over a sack of meat. It would require someone much stronger than us.</p><p>The father shape he leaves behind quickly becomes a hollow that we can put our grief into, which is an improvement in a way.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><b>Grace</b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I ask Mother if she had noticed any sickness in you. Any hint of your body giving way. She says, &#x201c;No, your father was in fine fettle.&#x201d; Dark turn. &#x201c;As you well fucking know.&#x201d;</p><p>Your body was not completely all right. Of course I would see that where she would not. I noticed a slight cough, mixed up a honey tincture for you the day before you died. Boiled nettles from the end of the garden, where we dump our rubbish and leave things to rot. My hands blistering as I pulled them from the earth in flat afternoon heat. You drank it straight from the saucepan. Sunburnt throat moving under the metal. We were sitting in the kitchen together, two stools pushed close. Your eyes were watery. You did not touch me. On the counter, three sardines spilled their guts.</p><p>&#x201c;Are you dying?&#x201d; I asked you.</p><p>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; you said. &#x201c;In many ways, I have never been better.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><b>Lia</b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Confirmation comes in the shape of his bloodstained shoe washed up high on the shore. Mother finds it, but we don&#x2019;t salt it or burn it the way we would with other dangerous waste. &#x201c;This is your father!&#x201d; she screams at me when I suggest it. So instead we pull on latex gloves and we all touch the blood patch on the shoe, and then we bury it in the forest. We fling the gloves into the shoe&#x2019;s open grave and Mother fills it in with a shovel. I cry on to Grace&#x2019;s shoulder until the flesh of it shows through the material of her dress, but she only stares into the canopy above us with dry eyes.</p><p>&#x201c;Can you feel something, for once?&#x201d; I whisper to her later in the dark, sharing her bed without asking permission.</p><p>&#x201c;I hope you die in the night,&#x201d; she whispers back.</p><p>Often Grace is repelled by me. I don&#x2019;t have the luxury of being repelled by her, even when her breath is sour and a gentle scum of dirt clings to her ankles. I take whatever contact I can get. Sometimes I harvest the hair from her brush and hide it under my pillow, when things get very bad.</p><p>Grace has a deep fascination with a pair of black patent sandals that one of the women left behind years ago. She straps them on from time to time even though the soles flap loose, the leather scales and flakes. One morning she puts them on and lies facedown in the sweating dew, right in the middle of the garden. When Sky and I find her, roll her over with our hands, she is motionless for thirty seconds or more. Her eyes are fixed. Her first movement is to rend at her hair, and we join in like it&#x2019;s a game, but it turns out it&#x2019;s a cue that I didn&#x2019;t even know I was waiting for. Then we are all just useless there on the lawn, already painfully overgrown, waiting for Mother to find us.</p><p>Because we are new to mourning, Mother is panicked. There are no therapies for this unknown crisis. But she is a resourceful woman, ardently repairing the broken her entire life. More than that, she was a woman at our father&#x2019;s side, absorbing and refining his theories. Her hands are bloodless when she lays them upon us. Soon a solution is found.</p><p>For one week, Sky and I share Grace&#x2019;s bed. For one week, Mother puts the small blue insomnia tablets on our tongues three to four times a day. Short and foggy breaks in the sleep to be slapped awake, to drink from the glasses of water that crowd the bedside table and to eat crackers Mother spreads with peanut butter, to crawl to the bathroom, because by the third day our legs can no longer be relied upon to hold us. The heavy curtains stay closed to keep the light out, to keep the temperature down.</p><p>&#x201c;What are you feeling?&#x201d; Mother asks us during those swims up to consciousness. &#x201c;Good, bad? Oh, I know that I wish I could sleep through all of this. You are the lucky ones.&#x201d;</p><p>She monitors our breathing, our pulses. Sky throws up and Mother is there immediately to tenderly scoop the vomit from her mouth with her forefinger and thumb. When she puts her into the bathtub to clean her up we are dimly aware of the shower running like a distant storm.</p><p>All through the long sleep my dreams are boxes filled with boxes filled with small trapdoors. I keep thinking I am awake, and then my arms fall off or the sky pulses a livid green, I am outside with my fingers in the sand and the sea is vertical, spilling its seams.</p><p>After, it takes a few days for my body to feel normal again. My knees still crumple when I stand. I have bitten my tongue, and it swells and moves in my mouth like a grub against dry earth.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><b>Grace, Lia, Sky<br><br></b></p><p>When we emerge from the lost week, we are surrounded by pieces of paper with Mother&#x2019;s writing on like reminders. They are pinned to the walls, slipped into drawers, folded into our clothes. The pieces of paper say, No more love! Her pain gives her the gravity of an oracle. We are very troubled by them. We ask her about them and she tells us a revised version.</p><p>&#x201c;Love only your sisters!&#x201d; All right, we decide, that is easy enough for us to do. &#x201c;And your mother,&#x201d; she adds. &#x201c;You have to love me too. It&#x2019;s my right.&#x201d; OK, we tell her. It is no problem.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><b>Grace</b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Sometimes we pray in the ballroom, sometimes in Mother&#x2019;s bedroom. It depends on whether we need bombast, Mother on the stage with her arms raised towards the ceiling, sound bouncing from the parquet. In her bedroom it is a quieter worship, graver. We hold hands very tightly, so we can blur where the I ends and the sister begins. &#x201c;Devotions for the women of our blood,&#x201d; we say.</p><p>It feels good to wish my sisters only well. I can feel them focusing on our love like a crucial piece of information that needs memorizing. &#x201c;Sometimes,&#x201d; Mother tells us, when she is trying to be loving, &#x201c;I can no longer tell you girls apart.&#x201d; Some days we like this, some days we don&#x2019;t.</p><p>The first time we gather to pray in Mother&#x2019;s room after your death, I broach the idea of drawing the irons again. When I say it nobody nods, nobody agrees with me. Our eyes go to where they hang on her wall. Five hooks, five lengths of iron. Five names above the hooks, but only four names on the irons.</p><p>&#x201c;Once a year, Grace,&#x201d; Mother tells me. &#x201c;Just because you don&#x2019;t like the result.&#x201d;</p><p>Lia looks sideways at me. She was the one who drew the blank iron, which meant that there was no specific love allocated to her this year. &#x201c;Bad luck,&#x201d; we told her. She was stoic. All of us put our arms around her and told her that of course we would still love her, of course, but we knew it wouldn&#x2019;t be the same, that she would have to scramble more for the affection, that it wouldn&#x2019;t come as easily. We wouldn&#x2019;t be able to touch her so freely. You picked me, as usual, tying me to you for another year. You rigged it. The whole thing was a sham.</p><p>&#x201c;My person is dead,&#x201d; I point out.</p><p>&#x201c;Grief is love,&#x201d; Mother says. I expect her to be angry, but she looks panicked instead. &#x201c;You could call it the purest kind.&#x201d;</p><p>So much for loving only my sisters.</p><p>It occurs to me that I would like you to come back to life so I could kill you myself.</p><p>&#x201c;We always love some people more,&#x201d; Mother explained when we first drew them. &#x201c;This way, we can keep it fair. Everyone gets their turn.&#x201d; It seemed simple, with those irons new in our hands and our names painted fresh upon them. Lia got me, that time.</p><p>We would all still love each other, but what it meant was: if there was a burning fire, if two sisters were stuck in the inferno and they were screaming a name, the only right thing would be to pick the one the iron dictated to save. It is important to ignore any contrary instinct of your traitor heart. We were quite used to that.</p></p><h2>The Editor&#39;s Companion: An Indispensable Guide to Editing Books, Magazines, Online Publications, and Mor e</h2><p>Excel at editing!<br><br>The editor's job encompasses much more than correcting commas and catching typos.

He succeeded at all but the last: Steingarten is "fairly sure that God meant the color blue mainly for food that has gone bad." In this impassioned, mouth-watering, and outrageously funny book, Steingarten devotes the same Zen-like discipline and gluttonous curiosity to practically everything that anyone anywhere has ever called "dinner." <br><br>Follow Steingarten as he jets off to sample choucroute in Alsace, hand-massaged beef in Japan, and the mother of all ice creams in Sicily. Sweat with him as he tries to re-create the perfect sourdough, bottle his own mineral water, and drop excess poundage at a luxury spa. Join him as he mounts a heroic--and hilarious--defense of salt, sugar, and fat (though he has some nice things to say about Olestra). Stuffed with offbeat erudition and recipes so good they ought to be illegal, <b>The Man Who Ate Everything</b> is a gift for anyone who loves food.</p><p>When Jeffrey Steingarten was made food critic of <i>Vogue</i> in 1989, he began by systematically learning to like all the food he had previously avoided. From clams to Greek food to Indian desserts with the consistency of face cream, Steingarten undertook an extraordinary program of self-inflicted behavior modification to prepare himself for his new career. He describes the experience in this collection's first piece, before setting out on a series of culinary adventures that take him around the world.<p>It's clear that <i>Vogue</i> gave Steingarten carte blanche to write on whatever subjects tickled his taste buds, and the result is a frequently hilarious collection of essays that emphasize good eating over an obsession with health. "Salad, the Silent Killer" is a catalog of the toxins lurking in every bowl of raw vegetables, while "Fries" follows a heroic attempt to create the perfect French fry--cooked in horse fat. Whether baking sourdough bread in his Manhattan loft or spraying miso soup across a Kyoto restaurant, Steingarten is an ideal guide to the wilder reaches of gastronomy, a cross between M.F.K. Fisher and H.L. Mencken.</p>Jeffrey Steingarten trained to become a food writer at Harvard College, Harvard Law School, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and the <b>Harvard Lampoon</b>.&nbsp;&nbsp;For the past eight years he has been the internationally feared and acclaimed food critic of <b>Vogue</b> magazine.&nbsp;&nbsp;He has been the food correspondent for the online magazine <b>Slate</b>. For essays in this collection, Mr. Steingarten has won countless awards from the James Beard Foundation and the International Association of Culinary Professionals. On Bastille Day, 1994, the French Republic made him a Chevalier in the Order of Merit for his writing on French gastronomy.&nbsp;&nbsp;As a man who ate everything, Chevalier Steingarten has no favorite food, color, or song.&nbsp;&nbsp;His preferred eating destinations, however, are Memphis, Paris, Alba, Chengdu--and his loft in New York City.</p><h2>Private Vegas</h2><p><b>Private investigator Jack Morgan is on the hunt for a murderer in Las Vegas-and the murder ring he uncovers is unlike anything he's ever seen.</b><br>Las Vegas is a city of contradictions: seedy and glamorous, secretive and wild, Vegas attracts people of all kinds-especially those with a secret to hide, or a life to leave behind.

Yet the extraterrestrial phenomenon did not begin in the present era. Far from it. The authors of <i>Wonders in the Sky</i> reveal a thread of vividly rendered-and sometimes strikingly similar- reports of mysterious aerial phenomena from antiquity through the modern age. These accounts often share definite physical features- such as the heat felt and described by witnesses-that have not changed much over the centuries. Indeed, such similarities between ancient and modern sightings are the rule rather than the exception. <br><br> In <i>Wonders in the Sky</i>, respected researchers Jacques Vallee and Chris Aubeck examine more than 500 selected reports of sightings from biblical-age antiquity through the year 1879-the point at which the Industrial Revolution deeply changed the nature of human society, and the skies began to open to airplanes, dirigibles, rockets, and other opportunities for misinterpretation represented by military prototypes. Using vivid and engaging case studies, and more than seventy-five illustrations, they reveal that unidentified flying objects have had a major impact not only on popular culture but on our history, on our religion, and on the models of the world humanity has formed from deepest antiquity. <br><br> Sure to become a classic among UFO enthusiasts and other followers of unexplained phenomena, <i>Wonders in the Sky</i> is the most ambitious, broad-reaching, and intelligent analysis ever written on premodern aerial mysteries.</p><p><b>Jacques Vallee</b>&nbsp;holds a master&#x2019;s degree in astrophysics from France and a PhD in computer science from Northwestern University. He is the author of several books about high technology and unidentified phenomena, a subject that first attracted his attention as an astronomer in Paris. While analyzing observations from many parts of the world, Vallee became intrigued by the similarities in every culture in patterns between modern sightings and historical reports of encounters with flying objects and their occupants. After a career as an information scientist with Stanford Research Institute and the Institute for the Future, where he served as a principal investigator for the groupware project on the ARPANET, the prototype of the Internet, Vallee cofounded a venture capital firm in Silicon Valley. He lives in San Francisco.<br><br><b>Chris Aubeck</b> was born in London. He moved to Spain at age 19, and after teaching in Cï¿½ceres and Madrid for 24 years, he now lives in Granada. His interest in the historical and sociological aspects of unexplained aerial phenomena began at an early age. A student of language and folklore, he has helped compile the largest collection of pre-1947 UFO cases in the world. He has spoken on his research in many articles and on public radio. In 2008 he was awarded a prize for his contributions to the field by the Spanish organization Fundaciï¿½n Anomalï¿½a.</p><h2>Off the Road: A Modern-Day Walk Down the Pilgrim&#39;s Route into Spain</h2><p><b>When Jack Hitt set out to walk the 500 miles from France to Santiago de Compostela, Spain, he submitted to the rigorous traditions of Europe's oldest form of packaged tour, a pilgrimage that has been walked by millions in the history of Christendom.</b> <br> <i>Off the Road</i> is an unforgettable exploration of the sites that people believe God once touched: the strange fortress said to contain the real secret Adam learned when he bit into the apple; the sites associated with the murderous monks known as the Knights Templar; and the places housing relics ranging from a vial of the Virgin Mary's milk to a sheet of Saint Bartholomew's skin. <br> Along the way, Jack Hitt finds himself persevering by day and bunking down by night with an unlikely and colorful cast of fellow pilgrims -- a Flemish film crew, a drunken gypsy, a draconian Belgian air force officer, a man who speaks no languages, a one-legged pilgrim, and a Welsh family with a mule. <br> In the day-to-day grind of walking under a hot Spanish sun, Jack Hitt and his cohorts not only find occasional good meals and dry shelter but they also stumble upon some fresh ideas about old-time zealotry and modern belief. <i>Off the Road</i> is an engaging and witty travel memoir of an offbeat journey through history that turns into a provocative rethinking of the past.</p><p>In this irreverent, ruminative adventure, Jack Hitt sets out to walk the 500 miles along the pilgrimage route from France to Santiago de Compostela, Spain. Off the Road charts the serendipitous encounters of another American innocent abroad, only this one submits to the rigorous traditions of Europe&#39;s oldest form of packaged tour. The result is a comic yet sympathetic attempt to understand the vanishing role of religion in modern life. Off the Road is an unforgettable tour of the sites that people believe God once touched: the strange fortress said to contain the real secret Adam learned when he bit the apple; the miraculous chickens of the fourteenth century whose descendants still dance in the church of Santo Domingo; the sites associated with the murderous monks known as the Knights Templar; and the places housing relics ranging from a vial of the Virgin Mary&#39;s milk to a sheet of Saint Bartholomew&#39;s skin. Along the way, in small-town shelters or lost among Spanish mountains, Jack Hitt finds himself persevering by day and bunking down by night with an unlikely cast of fellows - a Flemish film crew, a drunken gypsy, a draconian Belgian air force officer, a man who speaks no languages, a one-legged pilgrim, and a Welsh family with a mule. Off the Road rediscovers the warm hilarity that underlies the solemn rituals of the past. In the day-to-day grind of walking under a hot Spanish sun, Jack Hitt and his smelly cohorts not only find occasional good meals and dry shelter, but they also stumble upon some fresh ideas about old-time zealotry and modern belief. Anyone disturbed by America&#39;s sense of a disposable past will relish the way this offbeat journey through history turns into aprovocative rethinking of the present.<b>Jack Hitt</b> is a contributing writer for <i>Harper's</i> and <i>GQ.</i> He also writes for <i>The New York Times Magazine, Outside,</i> and <i>Mother Jones,</i> and contributes frequently to public radio's <i>This American Life.</i></p><h2>Auschwitz Lullaby: A Novel</h2><p><p><strong>Based on the true story of a brave German nurse tasked with caring for Auschwitz&#x2019;s youngest prisoners, <em>Auschwitz Lullaby</em>&nbsp;brings to life the story of Helene Hannemann&#x2014;a woman who sacrificed everything for family and fought furiously for the children she hoped to save.</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>On an otherwise ordinary morning in 1943, Helene Hannemann is preparing her five children for the day when the German police arrive at her home.

David Ovason, who has studied these astrological devices for ten years, now reveals why they have been placed in such abundance in the center of our nation's capital and explains their interconnections. His richly illustrated text tells the story of how Washington, from its foundation in 1791, was linked with the zodiac, with the meaning of certain stars, and with a hidden cosmological symbolism that he uncovers here for the first time.</p><p>Fascinating and thoroughly researched, <i>The Secret Architecture of Our Nation 's Capital</i> is an engrossing book that raises provocative questions and otters complex insights into the meanings behind the mysterious symbols in Washington.</p></p><p><p>David Ovason has spent more than a decade researching the architecture and zodiacs of Washington, D.C. He teaches astrology and has studied the life and writings of Nostradamus for more than forty years. He is the author of several books, including <em>The Secrets of Nostradamus</em> and <em>Nostradamus: Prophecies for America.</em> Mr. Ovason lives and works in England.</p>Ovason, an astrology teacher, analyzes the symbols in the architecture of Washington, DC, and connects them to the influences of the arcane traditions of Masonry. This ambitious work looks at the Capitol, the Washington Monument, city planning, and the numerous zodiacs located throughout the city. A major theme is the importance of the Virgo sign of the zodiac and how it is reflected in the sculpture, design, and ceremony involved in the construction of the capital. In general, the work contains thorough research and brilliant analysis, but the reader may find that Ovason reads too much into some symbols, especially when locating ties to Virgo. A minor problem is the overuse of substantive endnotes, which displaces some important information that could have been incorporated into the text. Recommended for academic libraries with collections of architectural history, Masonic, or esoteric literature. By contrast, The United States Capitol is a collection of specialists' papers offering numerous points of view on a single building in the nation's capital. The first section, on architecture, traces the design and construction of the building from its beginnings in 1790 through the present Office of the Architect. Much emphasis is placed on the conflicts of personality and philosophy that have burdened the building's development. The second section, on painting and sculpture, focuses more on the objects than the artists, giving considerable attention to techniques and hidden meanings within the works. Altogether, the book is well researched and appropriately illustrated with photographs and architectural drawings. Recommended for both academic and larger public libraries.DEric Linderman, Ida Rupp P.L., Port Clinton, OH <br>Copyright 2000 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Ethnobotany of Western Washington: The Knowledge and Use of Indigenous Plants by Native Americans</h2><p>Since its original publication in 1945, this small classic has acquired a new audience concerned with living in harmony with the environment and interested in the particularly intimate relationship of Native Americans to the land.

Then, in the spring of 1992, war broke out and his friends, neighbors and teammates all turned on him. Pero - Kenan's beloved karate coach - showed up at his door with an AK-47 - screaming: "You have one hour to leave or be killed!" Kenan&#x2019;s only crime: he was Muslim. This poignant, searing memoir chronicles Kenan&#x2019;s miraculous escape from the brutal ethnic cleansing campaign that swept the former Yugoslavia. After two decades in the United States, Kenan honors his father&#x2019;s wish to visit their homeland, making a list of what he wants to do there. Kenan decides to confront the former next door neighbor who stole from his mother, see the concentration camp where his Dad and brother were imprisoned and stand on the grave of his first betrayer to make sure he&#x2019;s really dead. Back in the land of his birth, Kenan finds something more powerful&#x2014;and shocking&#x2014;than revenge.</p><p><b>Kenan Trebincevic</b> immigrated to America in 1993 and became a citizen in 2001.

The traditional approach is rote memorization. Japanese children write each kanji hundreds of times at their desks, and eventually they are acquired. Michael Rowley offers a different way, a mnemonic-association approach that provides a hook on which to hang the meaning and retrieve it easily when the kanji comes into view. The concept is simple: each character is represented under the word or concept it stands for (such as <i>turf</i>, <i>bamboo</i>, <i>eat</i>, or <i>duty</i>), followed by the pronunciations of the word in Chinese and Japanese, and a drawing that captures the meaning and resembles the character enough so that it'll come to mind whenever the kanji is seen.<p> Organized thematically in chapters such as "Power," "Places," "Tools," "The World," "Food," "People," and "The Body," Rowley's book lets you learn the root symbols before teaching the words that add to them for further meanings. For example, the character for <i>water</i> is a splatter of three dashes that Rowley pictures as three splashing water drops. Later, you see that <i>steam</i>, <i>float</i>, <i>boil</i>, <i>dirt</i>, and <i>bathe</i> all build on the <i>water</i> character. For steam, there's the <i>water</i> character plus a series of lines that Rowley exaggerates to resemble swirling, vapory tendrils, and the association helps. Building on units of memory and relationship, recall is aided considerably by the simple yet evocative drawings. Rowley even manages to help with the hiragana and katakana syllabaries, providing appealing pictures that look a bit like the letters in question and begin with the same sounds. So the <i>na</i> letter looks like a knot, <i>nu</i> resembles Rowley's drawing of noodles held by chopsticks, and it's easier to remember which symbol means <i>te</i> when you picture a telephone pole.</p><p> It's hard to do Rowley's book justice with words, since the visual element is what makes it tick. He does a wonderful job, blending insight, imagination, and drawing technique, in a book that far surpasses the old rote method, making kanji learning both appealing and accessible. <i>--Stephanie Gold</i></p>Michael Rowley is an illustrator and graphic designer living in the San Francisco Bay Area.

For Monet himself, who believed overcooking was sacrilegious, the asparagus was lightly steamed to make it tender, but not enough to lose its crisp, nutty flavor. For his family, who preferred their asparagus well cooked, Marguerite would prepare a separate batch. Here the spears are dressed with an olive, caper and orange relish that Monet surely would have liked, as it is similar to the tapenade that he enjoyed on his painting trips along the French Riviera. While we call for the asparagus to be chilled, you can also serve it warm or at room temperature. This dish is ideal for a light lunch--make sure to prepare extra relish to serve on the side with crusty bread--or an apt prelude to grilled lamb, chicken or fish.

While I Was Gone<i> </i>[celebrates] what is impulsive in human nature.&#x201d;<br>&#x2013;The New York Times<br><br>&#x201c;Miller weaves her themes of secrecy, betrayal, and forgiveness into a narrative that shines.&#x201d;<br>&#x2013;Time<br>Jo Becker has every reason to be content. She has three dynamic daughters, a loving marriage, and a rewarding career. But she feels a sense of unease. Then an old housemate reappears, sending Jo back to a distant past when she lived in a communal house in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Drawn deeper into her memories of that fateful summer in 1968, Jo begins to obsess about the person she once was. As she is pulled farther from her present life, her husband, and her world, Jo struggles against becoming enveloped by her past and its dark secret.<br>&#x201c;[While I Was Gone] swoops gracefully between the past and the present, between a woman&#x2019;s complex feelings about her husband and her equally complex fantasies&#x2013;and fears&#x2013;about another man. . . .

As in her 1986 novel, The Good Mother, Miller shows how impulses can fracture the family.&#x201d;<br>&#x2013;USA Today<br><br>&#x201c;Marvelous . . . poignant . . . powerful.&#x201d;<br>&#x2013;Seattle Times/Post Intelligencer</p><p>In her still startling debut, <i>The Good Mother</i>, Sue Miller explored the premium we put on passion--and the terrible burden it places on a mother and child. Her fourth novel, <i>While I Was Gone</i>, is another study in familial crime and punishment. But this time, her wife and good mother is accessory to more than emotional malfeasance. Jo Becker has everything a woman could desire: a loving spouse, contented children, and a nice dog or two. When her New England veterinary practice takes on a new client, however, her past comes back to haunt her. Long ago, it seems, Jo had escaped her family and identity for a commune in Cambridge. Her Aquarian illusions came to an abrupt, bloody end when one of her housemates was brutally murdered.<p> Now this unhappy era returns in the person of Eli Mayhew, who had been the odd man out in Jo's boho household. His appearance is both tantalizing and upsetting: "Inside, I slowed down. I felt numbed. I had two last patients, and then I told Beattie to go home, that I'd close up.... I refiled the last charts, sprayed and wiped the examining table. I reviewed my list of routine surgeries for Wednesday. All the while I was thinking of Eli Mayhew, and of Dana and Larry and Duncan and me, and our lives in the house. Of the horrible way it had all ended." Sue Miller's fine novel is a penetrating--and sensuous--portrait of a woman besieged by her conscience. <i>While I Was Gone</i> also demonstrates that in the face of distance and betrayal, a little knowledge can be a dangerous thing indeed. <i>--Winnie Wheaton</i></p>"[A] riveting new nove ...The narrative pacing is masterly, building tension even in the most psychologically subtle passages ...The scenes are emotionally textured ...But most impressive is the complex portrait of the protagonist...<b>While I Was Gone</b> celebrates what is impulsive in human nature."--Christopher Lehmann-Haupt, The New York Times<br><br>"This is gripping, close-to-the-bone fiction...For the narrator, keeping part of herself secret becomes central to her identity...<b>While I Was Gone</b> urges us to consider, very carefully, what's best told and what's best kept private."--Dan Cryer, Newsday</p><h2>Joining God, Remaking Church, Changing the World: The New Shape of the Church in Our Time</h2><p>Exhausted with trying to &#x201c;fix&#x201d; the church? It&#x2019;s time to turn in a new direction: back to the Holy Spirit. In this insightful book, internationally renowned scholar and leader Alan Roxburgh urges Christians to follow the Spirit into our neighborhoods, re-engage with the mission of God, and re-imagine the whole enterprise of church. Joining God, Remaking Church, and Changing the World can guide any church &#x2015; large or small, suburban or urban, denomination-level or local parish &#x2015; to become a vital center for spirituality and mission.<br><br>ï¿½ Distills the best of mission wisdom for laity and clergy today<br>ï¿½ Roxburgh is a leading voice shaping church life ecumenically and globally<br><br>Alan Roxburgh offers deep hope and concrete steps forward for churches struggling with life in a post-Christian culture.

Faith: The Spirit is going ahead of us into our neighborhoods. Ancient/future: The answer isn&#x2019;t flashy promotions but deeper discipleship and community. Hope: When we dare to move outside our walls, we&#x2019;ll find work to do and our calling renewed.<br><br>&#x2015; Philip Clayton, scholar, activist and author of Transforming Christian Theology <br><br>Drawing on his years of experience with missional church theology and practice, Roxburgh outlines our attempts to end church decline and opens up fresh vision: What if the unraveling of the church is God&#x2019;s way of leading us out of bondage to American culture into God&#x2019;s new Exodus? What if God is inviting us to shift our focus and to discern and join God&#x2019;s presence and work in our neighborhoods? This book outlines practical steps congregations can embrace to experiment with this new/old way of living the Gospel locally. Engaging these practices will not be easy. And learning from God and neighbors how to participate in local missional experiments might actually transform both congregations and society.

The result, he says, is that students graduate from high school and even college with twisted beliefs about economics, foreign policy, war, religion, race relations, and many other subjects.<br><br>As he did in his popular <i>A Patriot&#x2019;s History of the United States</i>, Professor Schweikart corrects liberal bias by rediscovering facts that were once widely known. He challenges distorted books by name and debunks forty-eight common myths. A sample:<br><br>ï¿½ The founders wanted to create a &#x201c;wall of separation&#x201d; between church and state<br>ï¿½ Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation only because he needed black soldiers<br>ï¿½ Truman ordered the bombing of Hiroshima to intimidate the Soviets with "atomic diplomacy"<br>ï¿½ Mikhail Gorbachev, not Ronald Reagan, was responsible for ending the Cold War<br>America&#x2019;s past, though not perfect, is far more admirable than you were probably taught.</p><p>Larry Schweikart is the co-author of <b>A Patriot's History of the United States: From Columbus's Great Discovery to the War on Terror</b>, and is a professor of history at the University of Dayton. He has written more than 20 books on national defense, business, and financial history.Textbooks have long served as a main battlefield in the culture wars and the latest salvo comes from Schweikart, a history professor at the University of Dayton (<i>A Patriot's History of the United States</i>), who examines leading American history texts and other books that he sees as purveying a distinctly slanted view of American history&#x2014;one that portrays the United States as oppressive, imperialistic, and evil. Each lie is deliberated in a brief essay. A chapter on the notion that FDR knew in advance that the Japanese would attack Pearl Harbor focuses largely on countering Robert Stinnett's <i>Day of Deceit.</i> The belief that Columbus was responsible for killing millions of Indians (drivel) is, he says, based on faulty statistics. In examining the belief that Richard Nixon sent burglars into the Watergate office complex, the author accepts G. Gordon Liddy's account of events over John Dean's. Regarding the Rosenbergs, Schweikart cites Soviet documents proving they were indeed spies. Schweikart marshals an arsenal of statistics and scholarly studies, and while his own biases will limit his reach, he offers an object lesson in the need for scrupulous balance in the writing of history textbooks. <i>(Sept. 4) </i> <br>Copyright ï¿½ Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Just before the hanging, Dave swore his brothers would take vengenance. . .Four year later the Allard boys retumed to settle the score. Only Brionne&#39;s son escaped. They murdered his wife, destroyed his home, and left Brionne nothing but the charred ruins of his past to haunt him. Seeking peace and a new life, Brionne and the boy headed west. But the Allards hadn&#39;t finished with him. He knew they&#39;d call him for a showdown-and this time he&#39;d be ready . . . .</p><p>Our foremost storyteller of the American West, <b>Louis L&#x2019;Amour </b>has thrilled a nation by chronicling the adventures of the brave men and woman who settled the frontier. There are more than three hundred million copies of his books in print around the world.<i>Chapter One<br></i><br><br>The night brought a soft wind. It came gently, flowing through the gaps in the Blue Ridge Mountains and spilling over the valleys below, rustling the leaves outside the big house. They rustled, were still, then again they stirred.<br><br>Mat Brionne, who was not quite seven, lay awake, listening.<br><br>His father was in Washington to see President Grant, but was expected home soon, and Mat was eager for any sound that might herald his coming.<br><br>Mat loved his father, a tall, fine-looking man in uniform or out, a superb horseman, and as the neighbors said, "as fine a shot as ever held a gun."<br><br>The rustling of leaves stilled momentarily, and in the silence Mat heard a faint stir of horses moving up the lane from the highroad. These horses moved almost silently, which was not like his father's coming would be.<br><br>The curtains at the window were open, and in the faint light Mat could see the hands of the clock. He had just learned to tell time, and was very aware of each hour. It was past midnight. As he listened, the sounds ceased. Uneasy, remembering the stories of Indians and of renegades, he slipped from his bed and peered down into the yard.<br><br>For a moment he saw nothing, and then he caught the shine of an empty saddle, then a surreptitious movement in the shadows near a tree.<br><br>Frightened, he went down the hall to his mother's room. He opened the door, went in quickly, and touched her arm.<br><br>"Mother . . . there's some men outside. I heard them."<br><br>"It's your imagination, Mat. Your father won't be back until tomorrow."<br><br>"I didn't think it was pa. They're acting very quiet. I'm scared."<br><br>Anne Brionne got up and took her robe from a chair. There had been no trouble to speak of in Virginia since the end of the war, when James had been rounding up renegades.<br><br>"It's alright, Mat. No one would come to bother us. They know your father too well. Anyway, Sam would have heard them. He's sleeping in the gatehouse."<br><br>"Mother, this is Friday. Sam's never there on Friday. He goes to the tavern."<br><br>Nobody was supposed to know that, but Mat had overheard the overseer telling Sam to be careful&#x2013;that if the Major heard about it he would be discharged.<br><br>Anne Brionne stood very still, thinking. The nearest house was four miles away. Burt Webster, their overseer, had gone to visit his sister in Culpeper. The field hands were cutting firewood back in the mountains, and if Sam was gone they were alone on the place, except for the Negro maid, Malvernia.<br><br>"There's nothing to be afraid of, Mat. We'll go downstairs."<br><br>Their feet made no sound upon the soft carpets. James kept his guns locked in a cabinet in his study, but when they reached the foot of the stairs Anne Brionne paused, facing the front door. Someone was trying the door, turning the knob ever so gently. Mat heard it, too, and his grip on his mother's hand tightened.<br><br>For a moment she stood perfectly still, and in that instant she felt fear for the first time. Suddenly she knew who the men must be&#x2013;in Virginia, at this time, it could be nobody else. This was a time of peace. There had been little lawlessness since James ended the raids by the guerilla bands left over from the war.<br><br>Two years had gone by, but she still remembered the courtroom and the evil, hate-twisted face of Dave Allard as he hurled threats at her husband, Major James Brionne.<br><br>The Allards&#x2014;it was a name they adopted after leaving Missouri&#x2014;were a renegade family of doubtful origin who had been petty thieves before the war, and who blossomed into full-time thieves and murderers under cover of the war.<br><br>Dave Allard, several times a murderer, had been tracked down and captured by Major Brionne. At his trial it had been Brionne's testimony that convicted him, and he was sentenced to be hanged.<br><br>Allard had lunged from his chair screaming, "They'll kill you, Brionne! My folks'll git you! They'll see you an' yourn burn! Burn, I tell you!"<br><br>Anne Brionne forced herself now to think calmly. There was no one else it could be, and she had always feared they might come someday, although James had derided Dave Allard's words as the wild threat of a man never sound mentally.<br><br>If these were the Allards, they would be looking for James. Without a doubt they expected to find him here, and they had probably watched Sam leave for the tavern, to be sure no one else was in the house.<br><br>Now they would try the other doors and the windows. When they tried the dining-room window they would find it open, for the night had been warm and she had left the window open, as she often did, for the breeze off the mountain. She had neglected to close it, and Malvernia would not have been in that part of the house after dinner.<br><br>"Mat," she said calmly, "I want you to go down into the cellar and leave by the old root-cellar door. Go to your cave and stay there until one of us comes for you. No matter what happens, no matter what you hear, stay there until either your father or I come to get you."<br><br>"Mother, I&#x2014;"<br><br>"Do what you are told, Mat. That is the way your father would want it."<br><br>Still he hesitated. "Go," she repeated. "Go now."<br><br>A moment longer he hesitated&#x2014;he did not like to see his mother standing there, so quiet and pale. Then he fled.<br><br>Anne Brionne's glance from the study window showed several horses under the trees . . . she counted seven, and there might be others.<br><br>She unlocked the cabinet and took out the shotgun James used for hunting wild boar. It was loaded with heavy buckshot. Then she took out the pistol, a small derringer made in Philadelphia, that James had given her shortly after their marriage. It had two barrels, one under the other.<br><br>The doors from the dining room and the study faced the wide entrance hall on either side. She went up the six steps to the landing. From there the steps mounted in two wide, sweeping staircases to the second floor. On the landing there was a straight-backed chair.<br><br>Seating herself carefully, she arranged the folds of her robe about her, concealing the small gun in her lap under an edge of the gown. The shotgun she held across her knees. And there, her heart beating heavily, she waited.<br><br>This was her home. Here she had come as a bride, and Anne Brionne came of stubborn stock. Here she had lived in happiness. Here she had given birth to her son.<br><br>Generations of pioneer ancestors did not allow her to take the ownership of a home lightly. One had a home; one defended it. This was something she understood perfectly well.<br><br>She had never expected to be called upon to defend her home, although her grandmother had once defended a log cabin in this same state against an Indian attack. No, she had never expected it, but now that the moment had come she was prepared.<br><br>It was not an easy place to defend. She must frighten these intruders away, if possible. If poise and dignity could not do it, the shotgun must. In any case, Mat would be safe. The passage from the old root cellar, built for a pioneer house long ago, would allow Mat to escape to his river-bank cave. Even if they should find the passage, used only by Mat playing war games, they would not find the cave under the roots of the old oak.<br><br>After a moment, she rose. Taking a candle, she lighted it, and walked from place to place, lighting each candelabrum until the hall was as bright as for a party. Then she went back to the chair and seated herself as before.<br><br>There was no hope of keeping them out if they were determined to enter, but she hoped the shotgun might be sufficient to stop them and force them to leave. Yet deep within her she knew the man she had seen in the courtroom, shouting his threats, would not have been frightened off. Nor would his brothers or his cousins.<br><br>Fortunately, Malvernia was living in her own house behind the garden, and was not likely to be in danger. Her husband was off with the woodcutters, and she, too, was alone.<br><br>The footstep was faint, the door from the dining room opened ever so gently, and a man stood there. He was a big man with almost white hair, but he was young and strong. The muscles swelled the chest and sleeves of his shirt, a shirt that was soiled and worn, as was the vest he wore over it.<br><br>Slowly, he looked around, obviously amazed at everything he saw. A second man appeared, this one from the study door. He was slighter, and, if possible, he was dirtier than the first one. It was he who saw her.<br><br>He leaned forward, staring, as if unable to believe what his eyes told him. "It's a woman!" He spoke with astonishment. "Jest a-settin' there!"<br><br>Cotton Allard stepped further into the room. The newel post at the foot of the stairs bulked between them.<br><br>"You have come here to see Major Brionne," Anne Brionne said calmly. "He is not at home. This is not an hour at which we welcome guests. If you will come again, I am sure he will be most pleased to meet you."<br><br>"Now there's manners for ya." Cotton Allard was frankly admiring. "There sets a real lady. I allus wondered what them kind was like. Looks like we figure to find out."<br><br>"I would suggest"&#x2014;Anne Brionne's voice chilled "&#x2014;that you leave now."<br><br>Cotton Allard deliberately rolled his quid in his jaws and spat tobacco juice on the Persian rug. "I reckon with the Major gone we'll just have to make do with what's here." He turned toward the other man. "You tell the boys to take whatever they want from the house afore we set it afire. I aim to be busy right here."<br><br>"You tell 'em," the slighter man said. "I ain't a-goin' no place."<br><br>Cotton was cautious, keeping the newel post between himself and the woman. He had not yet seen the shotgun, which was partly hidden now beside her knee. Cotton could see only something dark by her hand, and something unnatural in her position.<br><br>The second man was less cautious. He stepped around in plain sight. Upstairs a door creaked faintly. So they had come up the back stairs too.<br><br>At that moment the slender, stoop-shouldered man rushed. Anne Brionne lifted the shotgun and shot him through the body.<br><br>In the hallway the boom of the gun was enormous. Anne saw the man caught in mid-stride, saw the expression of horror mask his face, and he slammed back as the charge hit him, and sprawled on his back on the floor.<br><br>Cotton Allard vaulted the banister, landing light as a cat on the landing beside her. From above, another man dropped off the balcony and the shotgun was torn from her. Coolly, she dropped her hand to the derringer, turned it on Cotton, and fired. It missed, and in almost the same instant Anne Brionne shot herself through the heart.<br><br>This it was that young Mat saw from the balcony where he had crouched, unable to leave his mother alone, but not knowing what to do. When Anne Brionne fell he gave a choking cry, and would have rushed to her.<br><br>Cotton saw him. "It's the kid!" he shouted. "Get him!"<br><br>Mat fled. Down the back stairs he went, down the steeper steps into the utter blackness of the cellar, but he needed no guide light to find the door to the old passage to the root cellar. He fled through the darkness, emerged under the trees, and glanced back toward the house just in time to see a man touch a candle to the curtains, those beautiful lace curtains his mother had imported from Alenton. The flames leaped high.<br><br>He crept down the bank, shivering and frightened. Behind the roots was his cave. He crept in and lay still, stiff and numb with shock.<br><br>The Allards ran from the house, clutching bottles of whiskey and brandy. Dimly, Mat heard their drunken shouts above the crackle of the flames. A long time later he fell asleep, remembering with horror the face of Cotton Allard, and of Tuleson, the one who had dropped from the balcony.<br><br>There under the roots Major James Brionne and Malvernia found Mat, curled up and asleep, on the following morning.<br><br><i>Chapter Two<br></i><br><br>Major James Brionne glanced across the table at his son.<br><br>"Make the most of this, Mat. Soon you'll have to put up with my cooking."<br><br>"I like your cooking, pa."<br><br>The boy was subdued, too much so. In the four months that had gone by since the death of his mother, Mat had been very quiet. He talked only when spoken to, asked no questions, but stayed right at his father's heels as if he feared to lose him too.<br><br>Little by little he had told the story of that night&#x2013; of his mother's quiet courage, of the awe-struck renegades; he had even told that last remark, heard as he hesitated briefly in the door, the remark made by Cotton Allard. "By the Lord Harry," Allard had said, "that there was a woman!"<br><br>But his words had come rarely, and Brionne had not tried to prod the boy into talking. There was no thought of returning to the estate the Major had loved so well. It was all too fresh in the boy's mind. What was needed was change, a complete and drastic change that would bring fresh interests, fresh demands.<br><br>"It is a lonely place to which we are going, Mat. We will see other people only when we go for supplies, but the town will be very small, I imagine."<br><br>James Brionne was a tall, wide-shouldered man of thirty-three, his face strongly boned, and darkened by sun and wind. He possessed that rare quality known as presence, and beneath it there was something else, for those who knew men of violence had a way of looking twice at James Brionne. Under the dignity, the poise, the military bearing there was something very tough and dangerous.<br><br>"We will be riding the steam cars, Mat. We will ride them for several days. You will be seeing a lot of new country."<br><br>"Will there be Indians?" Mat asked.<br><br>It was the first question, the first stir of interest he had shown.<br><br>"A few, I expect. I hope there will be no hostiles."<br><br>Suddenly a man in uniform was beside their table. "Major? The General is upstairs. He wishes to see you."</p><h2>The Great Passage</h2><p><p><b>An award-winning story of love, friendship, and the power of human connection.</b></p><p> Kohei Araki believes that a dictionary is a boat to carry us across the sea of words.

Only his best friend, Victor, seems to have an explanation for his good fortune: the photograph -- his lucky charm. <br><br>Back home in Colorado, Thibault can't seem to get the woman in the photograph out of his mind and he sets out on a journey across the country to find her. But Thibault is caught off guard by the strong attraction he feels for the woman he encounters in North Carolina - Elizabeth, a divorced mother -- and he keeps the story of the photo, and his luck, a secret. As he and Elizabeth embark upon a passionate love affair, his secret soon threatens to tear them apart -- destroying not only their love, but also their lives. <br><br>Filled with tender romance and terrific suspense, THE LUCKY ONE is an unforgettable story about the surprising paths our lives often take and the power of fate to guide us to true and everlasting love.</p><p>With over 100 million copies of his books sold, Nicholas Sparks is one of the world's most beloved storytellers.

But when he sets out to find the woman, he is met with unexpected circumstances surrounding his new love and his shrouded past. Though not Sparkss most original tale, the story flows well and narrator John Bedford Lloyd delivers a solid performance. Lloyds deep bass tone is perfectly suited for Thibault, a manly man if ever there was one. Lloyds supporting characters are rich and interesting in their own right, some speaking in comical Southern drawls, others with a raw reality. The final result is quite touching without much over-the-top sentimentality on Lloyds part. <i>A Grand Central hardcover.

This iconic journey changed the world forever, and the truths revealed continue to influence every corner of the globe today. <p></p> A young man in line for the throne is trapped in his father's kingdom and yearns for the outside world. Betrayed y those closest to him, Siddhartha abandons his palace and princely title. Face-to-face with his demons, he becomes a wandering monk and embarks on a spiritual fast that carries him to the brink of death. Ultimately recognizing his inability to conquer his body and mind by sheer will, Siddhartha transcends his physical pain and achieves enlightenment. <p></p> Although we recognize Buddha today as an icon of peace and serenity, his life story was a tumultuous and spellbinding affair filled with love and sex, murder and loss, struggle and surrender. From the rocky terrain of the material world to the summit of the spiritual one, <i>Buddha</i> captivates and inspires&#x2014;ultimately leading us closer to understanding the true nature of life and ourselves. <p></p></p><p><p>Deepak Chopra, M.D., is the author of more than eighty books translated into over forty-three languages, including numerous <em>New York Times</em> bestsellers in both fiction and nonfiction categories.</p>The audio version of this text may very well trump the written one because of Chopras deft character performance, authentic Indian pronunciation, and familiarity with the story of a fellow Indian who came to be known as the Buddha. The narrative is enhanced by Chopras vocal manipulation, which gives the characters a unique presence throughout. Although Chopra is the only narrator, his voice shifts at times to portray fierce antagonists: demon, rebellious cousin, manipulative king, Siddarthas father. This approach contrasts with his natural inflection when he speaks in the voices of Siddartha/Buddha, truly sounding more compassionate and kind. This production is certain to entertain and inform.

There were about eight of us seated around Dr. Radhakrishnan, who was then Sir Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan, Spalding Professor of Eastern Religions and Ethics at Oxford University. Here was this great man speaking to just a few people in his sitting room. His audience was equally divided between a few students and a few elderly ladies, mostly from North Oxford. This was the late nineteen forties, and widespread interest in Eastern religions and philosophy had to wait till the sixties. Dr. Radhakrishnan had founded the Group for the Study of Religions. I was its secretary, and we invited speakers from different religions. We were always on the point of folding.</p><p>We were lucky to be so few because we had more of Dr. Radhakrishnan&#x2019;s attention. We started with Robert Ernest Hume&#x2019;s translation of the short Upanishad. The Upanishad is the usual starting point for the study of the Upanishads&#x2014;rather unfortunately, because to my mind it is one of the most difficult. However, though I could not fully understand it, I was hooked. As we read through more Upanishads, the conviction grew that here was the truth. It was self-evident. No proof was needed, even across the span of centuries. I had stumbled on it, and I have never wavered from this conviction. These fellows knew what they were talking about. They had seen through the veil.</p><p>It was quite clear: This was not about belief, it was about experience. The sages were speaking about states of consciousness in this life that could be experienced by anyone. The fundamental insight was that the deepest layer of one&#x2019;s own experience, one&#x2019;s Self, was identical with the basis of the world outside. There was a unity of all things.</p><p>Dr. Radhakrishnan saw it as his mission to bring the knowledge of Indian philosophy to the outside world and to protect it from misinterpretation. His particular <i>bï¿½te noire</i> was Albert Schweitzer, who accused Indian thought of world and life negation. Dr. Radhakrishnan made it his business to refute him with numerous quotations about engaged action.</p><p>Dr. Radhakrishnan did not set out to be a guru. He was a philosopher who, with a wonderful command of the English language, pointed the way to the truth that his students had then to find in their own lives. Later, I was fortunate to find a teacher in Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, who could lead me to the actual experience that Dr. Radhakrishnan spoke about. Even in the early days, the Upanishads were not completely theoretical for me. I found the sages&#x2019; matter-of-fact utterances moving, much more so than devotional texts. They gave me a glow, but that is not the same as actually experiencing the state or states of consciousness of which the Upanishads speak. Maharishi opened the way through his simple teaching which, just because of its simplicity, posed no obstacles to inner experience. I was very fortunate to come into contact with these great teachers who opened up the wisdom of the Upanishads to me.</p><p>&#x2014;VERNON KATZ</p><p></p><p></p><p><i>Introduction</i></p><p>The word <i>upanishad</i> means &#x201c;sit down near&#x201d;: <i>upa</i> (near), <i>ni </i>(down) and <i>shad </i>(sit). Traditionally, the student sat down near the teacher to receive secret instruction, and in this way knowledge was passed down from teacher to student, linking each new generation back to the ancient tradition of the Upanishads. Many of the Upanishads consist of a dialogue between teacher and student in the deep quietude of a forest hermitage () or in the home of the teacher (where the students lived as part of a system called <i>guru-kula</i>).</p><p>The great teacher Shankara explained the word <i>upanishad </i>as &#x201c;the knowledge of Brahman by which ignorance is destroyed.&#x201d;1 In other accounts, &#x201c;sit down near&#x201d; (<i>upanishad</i>) refers to the hidden connection between everything, whether it is the connection between the teacher and student, or more broadly, the infinite correlation among all things, the oneness of reality. In this way the word <i>upanishad </i>might be thought of as a state of consciousness in which everything is connected to one&#x2019;s own Self.</p><p>According to India&#x2019;s ancient tradition of knowledge, the Upanishads were cognized by , or seers. The profound truths dawned spontaneously in the silent depths of their consciousness and were recorded by them and passed down through generations, first orally and later in written form.</p><p>According to the Upanishad2 there are 108 Upanishads, although scholars later recorded more than two hundred. The first ten are considered to be the principal Upanishads: , Kena, Katha, Prashna, , , , Aitareya, and . Sometimes the is also added, bringing the list to eleven. Shankara commented on these eleven. Because he also referred to four other Upanishads (, , and Paingala) in his commentary on the Brahma , these Upanishads are sometimes also included as principal Upanishads, bringing the list to fifteen (or fourteen, if the Upanishad is not included). Each of the Upanishads is associated with one of the four Vedas: ,3 , Yajus4 and Atharva. For the nine Upanishads in this volume, the Aitareya belongs to the Veda; the Kena belongs to the Veda; the Katha, and belong to the Yajur Veda (the Yajur Veda has two branches); the belongs to the Shukla Yajur Veda; and the Prashna, and belong to the Atharva Veda. Upanishads of the same Veda often have the same introductory and concluding verse ().</p><p>Some of the Upanishads are in verse, others are in prose and a few are a mixture of both.5 While several Upanishads are short, such as the (twelve verses) and the (eighteen verses), other Upanishads are considerably longer, such as the and Upanishads.6 Slight variations in wording are found, as they have been passed down in an oral tradition for thousands of years.7</p><p>The Upanishads are the last part or culmination of the Veda and so are called . They are known as the <i> ,</i> the section of the Veda that deals with knowledge&#x2014;knowledge of the ultimate reality. Since the Upanishads are part of the Veda, they are regarded as <i>shruti</i>, or &#x201c;that which is heard.&#x201d; Traditionally, they are considered to be <i>apaurusheya</i>, which means they are not the creation of individuals, not made up like poetry; rather they were revealed to enlightened seers who saw and heard these truths in the depths of their awakened consciousness. The Upanishads are also thought to be <i>nitya</i>&#x2014;true for all time, all places and all people.</p><p>INFLUENCE OF THE UPANISHADS</p><p>The Upanishads have enjoyed a growing global influence over the centuries. The first known translation of the Upanishads, from the original Sanskrit into Persian, was commissioned in 1656 by Muhammad Dara Shikoh, the eldest son of Shah Jehan, who built the Taj Mahal. In 1802, the French scholar Abraham Anquetil-Duperron translated the Persian volume into French and Latin. The German philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer read Anquetil-Duperron&#x2019;s Latin translation and famously said of the Upanishads:</p><p>The Upanishads are the production of the highest human wisdom and I consider them almost superhuman in conception. The study of the Upanishads has been a source of great inspiration and means of comfort to my soul. From every sentence of the Upanishads deep, original and sublime thoughts arise, and the whole is pervaded by a high and holy and earnest spirit. In the whole world there is no study so beneficial and so elevating as that of the Upanishads. The Upanishads have been the solace of my life and will be the solace of my death.8</p><p>Influenced by Schopenhauer, the German scholar Paul Deussen translated the Upanishads and said, &#x201c;On the tree of wisdom there is no fairer flower than the Upanishads and no finer fruit than the philosophy.&#x201d;9</p><p>In America, Henry David Thoreau, Ralph Waldo Emerson and Walt Whitman were among the first to read the literature of India. Thoreau described the universal nature of the Vedas and eloquently gave an account of reading them:</p><p>What extracts from the Vedas I have read fall on me like the light of a higher and purer luminary, which describes a loftier course through a purer stratum,&#x2014;free from particulars, simple, universal. It rises on me like the full moon after the stars have come out, wading through some far summer stratum of the sky.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. One wise sentence is worth the state of Massachusetts many times over.10</p><p>Emerson noted, also eloquently, how the ancient literature of India resolves many of the questions of existence that the modern mind is engaged in solving:</p><p>It was as if an empire spoke to us, nothing small or unworthy, but large, serene, consistent, the voice of an old intelligence, which in another age and climate had pondered and thus disposed of the questions that exercise us.11</p><p>Walt Whitman read the Upanishads and described the universal spirit of this knowledge:</p><p>These are the thoughts of all men in all ages and lands, they are not original with me,</p><p>If they are not yours as much as mine they are nothing or next to nothing,</p><p>If they do not enclose everything they are next to nothing,</p><p>If they are not the riddle and the untying of the riddle they are nothing,</p><p>If they are not just as close as they are distant they are nothing.12</p><p>The Austrian physicist Erwin Schrï¿½dinger discussed the universal nature of knowledge and the universal nature of consciousness found in the Upanishads:</p><p>There is no kind of framework within which we can find consciousness in the plural; this is simply something we construct because of the temporal plurality of individuals, but it is a false construction.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The only solution to this conflict insofar as any is available to us at all lies in the ancient wisdom of the Upanishad.13</p><p>Schrï¿½dinger&#x2019;s contemporary, the Danish physicist Niels Bohr, said, &#x201c;I go into the Upanishads to ask questions.&#x201d;14</p><p>Referring to the Upanishads as &#x201c;some of the most sacred words that have ever issued from the human mind,&#x201d; Rabindranath Tagore wrote, &#x201c;The messages contained in these, like some eternal source of light, still illumine and vitalize the religious mind of India.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Seekers of life&#x2019;s fulfillment may make living use of the texts, but can never exhaust them of their freshness of meaning.&#x201d;15</p><p>One of the most influential persons to introduce the Upanishads to a wider Western audience was the Oxford scholar and second president of India, Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan. In 1953, while vice president of India, he published his translation of the Upanishads. Here he identifies their central theme:</p><p>Anyone who reads the Upanishads in the original Sanskrit will be caught up and carried away by the elevation, the poetry, the compelling fascination of the many utterances through which they lay bare the secret and sacred relations of the human soul and the ultimate reality.16</p><p>PRINCIPAL THEMES IN THE UPANISHADS</p><p>The Upanishads are a celebration of the awakening of the Self (),17 a state of unbounded pure being, pure bliss<i>.</i> They reveal the great truth of life: The Self of the individual is identical to the Self of the universe (<i>Brahman</i>). They sing out, &#x201c;I am totality&#x201d; ( ).18 The wholeness of life, Brahman, expresses itself as every particle of creation and as every human being. This is the profound message of the Upanishads.</p><p><i>The Self, Unbounded Awareness</i></p><p>As we have seen, the Upanishads define as the Self, the inner essence that transcends the personality. The Self is awareness itself, devoid of any content such as thoughts, feelings and perceptions. It is pure wakefulness, the awareness that enables one to be conscious. Like the silent depth of the ocean, the Self is described as the abstract core of the mental and physical levels of reality. It is not limited by any kind of physicality; it is pure spirituality, with no distinctions, no boundaries, no thoughts, no emotions, no sensations&#x2014;just pure, unbounded awareness aware of itself.</p><p>While the Upanishads describe the Self as nonlocalized, they refer to the space within the heart as &#x201c;the seat of consciousness,&#x201d; the place where consciousness is most vibrant, often referred to as a secret cave. For example, the Katha Upanishad says, &#x201c;The inner Self is ever seated deep in the hearts of men,&#x201d;19 and the Upanishad describes the Self as set in the heart:</p><p>Vast, divine, of inconceivable form,</p><p>subtler than the subtle, that shines forth,</p><p>farther than the farthest, and yet here, near at hand.</p><p>It is here within those who see, set in the secret place of the heart.</p><p>Not by the eye is it grasped, nor even by speech,</p><p>nor by the other senses, nor by austerity or action.</p><p>When one&#x2019;s nature is purified by the clarity of knowledge,</p><p>only then, as he meditates, does he perceive him, the indivisible.20</p><p>In these verses, after first locating the Self in the region of the heart, the Upanishad discusses how the Self is known. The Self is not known through sight, because it has no form. Neither is the Self known through hearing, because it has no sound. The Self is known when the mind has completely settled and there are no perceptions of anything limited or temporal in nature. What remains is awareness itself in its unbounded state. One is still aware, but there is no localized object of awareness. Awareness is aware of itself alone, as described in the Upanishad:</p><p>There he does not see. Though seeing,</p><p>he doe...</p></p><h2>The Dog Encyclopedia: The Definitive Visual Guide (DK Pet Encyclopedias)</h2><p>Covering the history, breeds, care, health, and positive training of dogs &#x2014; all in one easy reference &#x2014; <i>The Dog Encyclopedia</i> is a fully illustrated encyclopedia of all things canine. <p>With an extensive photographic catalog of more than 400 dog breeds, organized by to FCI groupings, each profile describes the breed's uses and character, lists compatible owner traits, and shares fascinating facts about the breed's origins.</p> <p>Dog owners, breeders, and fans will also learn about canine anatomy and body systems; instinct and behavior; how dogs interact with humans; and the essentials of good care.</p> <p>The book gives expert advice on equipment, handling, exercise, play, feeding, grooming, and breeding.

Coming from the deep silence and asceticism of mediï¿½val Carthusian monasteries, this book's prayers and meditations have a unique ardour that reflects the genuine spirituality of their authors. The piety of these monks, strongly grounded in Sacred Scripture and the early Fathers of the Church, cannot fail to impress and to inspire. Like that of Jesus, Carthusian prayer, but also any authentic prayer, is anchored in interiority, solitude and silence. Jesus goes off to a deserted place, under the sole gaze of the Father. And in this solitude and this silence, He formed His disciples.</p></p><p></p><h2>Seize the Day (with Dietrich Bonhoeffer): A 365 Day Devotional</h2><p>This devotional of 365 meditations by theologian and martyr Dietrich Bonhoeffer helps you see that it is possible to impact that world if we allow ourselves to be transformed into the likeness of Christ. Experience the power of Bonhoeffer&#x2019;s words in a way that challenges you to live out your discipleship daily&#x2015;combining personal spirituality with an active concern for those around you.</p><p>Some talk about the cost of following Christ. Dietrich Bonhoeffer paid the price. Dietrich Bonhoeffer&#x2019;s faith-driven resistance to the Nazis during World War II resulted in his execution. Multitudes have been inspired by the hauntingly powerful words of this man who was willing to die for his convictions. In this collection of 365 meditations, Dr. Charles Ringma allows us to experience the power of Bonhoeffer&#x2019;s words in a way that challenges us to live out our discipleship daily-combining personal spirituality with an active concern for those around us. These daily meditations on Bonhoeffer&#x2019;s writings may make you uncomfortable. But if you are willing to wrestle-as Bonhoeffer did-with what it means to be a follower of Christ, you&#x2019;ll be empowered to seize each day.Dr Charles Ringma is a Dutch-born Australian citizen trained at the Reformed Theological College in Geelong and The University of Queensland, Brisbane, Australia.

Peirce's theories of pragmatism as a basis for his own conception of that influential philosophy. For James, this meant an emphasis on "radical empiricism" and the concept that the meaning of any idea &#x2014; philosophical, political, social, or otherwise &#x2014; has validity only in terms of its experiential and practical consequences. <br>James propounded his theories of pragmatism in this book, one of the most important in American philosophy. In a sense, he wished to test competing systems of thought in the "marketplace of actual experience" to determine their validity, i.e. whether adopting a particular philosophical theory or way of looking at the world makes an actual difference in individual conduct or in how we perceive and react to the varieties of experience. In these pages, James not only makes a strong case for his own ideas, but mounts a powerful attack against the transcendental and rationalist tradition.<br>For anyone interested in William James or the history of American philosophical thought, Pragmatism is an essential and thought provoking reference. In this handy, inexpensive edition, it will challenge and stimulate any thinking person.</p><p></p></p><p>William JamesThe meanings--twenty? thirty?--of "pragmatism" continue to be a central question in American philosophy and intellectual history. A chance to see the development and working of James's own mind from the inside, as it were, should do much to help us understand where he himself stood and what he himself meant...In brief, scholars, students, and the general reading public should all display an interest in a critical edition of James's works.<br> --Charles Frankel</p><h2>The First Law Trilogy: The Blade Itself, Before They are Hanged, Last Argument of Kings</h2><p>The trilogy is set in an epic fantasy world at war, reminiscent of medieval-era Europe and the greater Mediterranean world.

The host, Colonel William J. Donovan, known as &#x201c;Wild Bill&#x201d; since his days as an officer during World War I, was close to sixty. A war hero whose valor had earned him the Medal of Honor, Donovan was now back in uniform. Donovan responded to the call to duty and put aside a successful Wall Street law practice to become Director of the Office of Strategic Services (OSS) and America&#x2019;s first spymaster.</p><p>Donovan&#x2019;s guest, for whom he graciously poured sherry, was Stanley Platt Lovell. A New Englander in his early fifties, Lovell was an American success story. Orphaned at an early age, he worked his way through Cornell University to ascend the ranks of business and science by sheer determination and ingenuity. As president of the Lovell Chemical Company, he held more than seventy patents, though still described himself as a &#x201c;sauce pan chemist.&#x201d;</p><p>Donovan understood that the fight against the Axis powers required effective intelligence operations along with a new style of clandestine warfare. Just as important, he appreciated the role men like Lovell could play in those operations. &#x201c;I need every subtle device and every underhanded trick to use against the Germans and the Japanese&#x2014;by our own people&#x2014;but especially by the underground in the occupied countries,&#x201d; he had told Lovell a few days earlier. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ll have to invent them all... because you&#x2019;re going to be my man.&#x201d;</p><p>The wartime job offered to the mild-mannered chemist was to head the Research and Development (R&amp;D) Branch of the OSS, a role Donovan compared to that of Professor Moriarty, the criminal mastermind of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle&#x2019;s Sherlock Holmes stories. Lovell, although initially intrigued by the offer, was now having doubts and came to Donovan&#x2019;s Georgetown home to express those reservations. He had been in government service since that spring at a civilian agency called the National Development and Research Committee (NDRC). Created by President Roosevelt at the urging of a group of prominent scientists and engineers, the NDRC&#x2019;s mission was to look into new weapons for what seemed to be America&#x2019;s inevitable entry into the war. Lovell had joined the NDRC to act as liaison&#x2014;a bridge&#x2014;between the military, academics, and business. But what Donovan proposed now was something altogether different.</p><p>The mantle of Professor Moriarty was, at best, a dubious distinction. An undisputed genius, the fictional Moriarty earned the grudging respect of Holmes by secretly ruling a vast criminal empire of London&#x2019;s underworld with brutal efficiency and ingenuity. In his role as Professor Moriarty of the OSS, Lovell would oversee the creation of a clandestine arsenal that would include everything from satchel concealments to carry secret documents and subminiature spy cameras to specialized weapons and explosives. These were the weapons to be used in a war fought not by American troops in uniform, but by soldiers of underground resistance movements, spies, and saboteurs.</p><p>Spying and sabotage were unfamiliar territory for both America and Lovell, who had made his fortune developing chemicals for shoe and clothing manufacturers. America, Lovell believed, did not resort to the subterfuge of espionage or the mayhem of sabotage. When the United States looked into the mirror of its own mythology, it did not see spies skulking in the shadows of back alleys; instead, it saw men like Donovan, who faced the enemy in combat on the front lines.</p><p>&#x201c;The American people are a nation of extroverts. We tell everything and rather glory in it,&#x201d; he explained to Donovan. &#x201c;A Professor Moriarty is as un-American as sin is unpopular at a revival meeting. I&#x2019;d relish the assignment, Colonel, but dirty tricks are simply not tolerated in the American code of ethics.&#x201d;</p><p>Donovan, as Lovell would later write, answered succinctly. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t be so goddamn naï¿½ve, Lovell. The American public may profess to think as you say they do, but the one thing they expect of their leaders is that we be smart,&#x201d; the colonel lectured. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t kid yourself. P. T. Barnum is still a basic hero because he fooled so many people. They will applaud someone who can outfox the Nazis and the Japs... Outside the orthodox warfare system is a great area of schemes, weapons, and plans which no one who knows America really expects us to originate because they are so un-American, but once it&#x2019;s done, an American will vicariously glory in it. That is your area, Lovell, and if you think America won&#x2019;t rise in applause to what is so easily called &#x2018;un-American&#x2019; you&#x2019;re not my man.&#x201d;</p><p>Lovell took the job. Donovan knew what he wanted, but even more important, he knew what was needed. He had toured the secret labs of Great Britain that created just such devices. He also maintained close ties with the British Security Coordination (BSC), England&#x2019;s secretive intelligence organization in North America, through which the United States was already funneling weapons to assist in the war effort. Even the mention of Sherlock Holmes&#x2019;s ruthless criminal adversary may not have been a chance literary allusion. Two years earlier, in 1940, British Prime Minister Winston Churchill signed into existence the Special Operations Executive (SOE) with the instructions &#x201c;Now go out and set Europe ablaze!&#x201d; SOE&#x2019;s mandate was unconventional warfare, including the arming of resistance fighters in the war against Germany. Its London headquarters was an undistinguished office building on Baker Street, the same street as Sherlock Holmes&#x2019;s fictional address.</p><p>Although Donovan eventually persuaded Lovell to join the OSS, the chemist&#x2019;s initial assessment of the American public&#x2019;s dim view toward espionage was not unfounded. From the beginning, the idea of an American intelligence service was controversial. One senator proclaimed, &#x201c;Mr. Donovan is now head of the Gestapo in the United States.&#x201d; In the best tradition of Washington&#x2019;s bureaucratic infighting, the person in charge of the State Department&#x2019;s Passport Office, Mrs. Ruth Shipley, insisted on stamping &#x201c;OSS&#x201d; on the passports of Donovan&#x2019;s personnel traveling overseas, making them perhaps the most well-documented secret agents in the history of espionage. To remedy the situation, which had reached a deadlock between the OSS and the State Department, FDR himself had to intervene on the young agency&#x2019;s behalf with the stubborn Mrs. Shipley.</p><p>The media of the day was no more charitable, often treating the OSS dismissively. The Washington columnist Drew Pearson called the nascent spy agency &#x201c;one of the fanciest groups of dilettante diplomats, Wall Street bankers, and amateur detectives ever seen in Washington.&#x201d; More colorful phrases were penned by Washington&#x2019;s <i>Times-Herald </i>society columnist, Austine Cassini, who breathlessly wrote:</p><i><p>If you should by chance wander in the labyrinth of the OSS you&#x2019;d behold ex&#x2013;polo players, millionaires, Russian princes, society gambol boys, scientists and dilettante detectives. All of them are now at the OSS, where they used to be allocated between New York, Palm Beach, Long Island, Newport and other Meccas frequented by the blue bloods of democracy. And the girls! The prettiest, best-born, snappiest girls who used to graduate from debutantedom to boredom now bend their blonde and brunette locks, or their colorful hats, over work in the OSS, the super-ultra-intelligence-counter-espionage outfit that is headed by brilliant &#x201c;Wild Bill&#x201d; Donovan.</p></i><p>Cassini made it all sound like good clean fun. A bastion of pampered blue bloods, the OSS seemed no more dangerous than a country club cotillion. But at a time when less privileged sons and husbands were fighting and dying in the South Pacific and North Africa, the levity in the words &#x201c;gambol boys&#x201d; and &#x201c;dilettante detectives&#x201d; was almost assuredly bitter reading for many. Not surprisingly, the organization&#x2019;s acronym was soon transformed into the less than flattering &#x201c;Oh So Social&#x201d; by career military officers and draftees alike. The fact that an early OSS training facility was based at the plush Congressional Country Club, located just outside Washington, only served to reinforce the notion of privilege and elitism.</p><p>If OSS seemed a bastion of aristocrats and bankers, it was not without reason. Donovan worked on Wall Street in the days leading up to World War II. When he became Coordinator of Information (COI), an OSS predecessor, in 1941, Donovan staffed the organization from circles with which he was familiar&#x2014;the New York legal, business, and financial worlds&#x2014;along with graduates from the nation&#x2019;s finest universities. However, there was more to this than simply establishing an &#x201c;Old Boys&#x2019; Club&#x201d; of espionage. Prior to World War II, travel opportunities for abroad and learning foreign languages were largely limited to the privileged. As a result many of those recruited came with intimate knowledge of the European landscape, including the cities and towns of France, Germany, and Italy, from past travels. Others had done business in Europe before the war and could re-establish contacts.</p><p>Less visible than the privileged blue bloods were the refugees, those recent immigrants and first-generation native-born Americans (many of them academics) who also joined the ranks of the OSS. Unlike the Wall Street bankers and ex-polo players, these recruits brought day-to-day knowledge of foreign cultures, along with clothing, identity papers, and language skills.</p><p>Even as it became the target of Washington infighting and attracted the derision of newspaper columnists, Donovan&#x2019;s organization expanded rapidly. If the United States was going to enter what Rudyard Kipling called &#x201c;the Great Game&#x201d; of international espionage Donovan needed to move quickly. Spurred on by the urgency of war, the OSS would share clandestine responsibilities with the Allies. The London Agreements, negotiated in 1942 and 1943, established a protocol for clandestine cooperation between OSS and the SOE, defining each side&#x2019;s role, down to the development of weaponry and financial responsibilities. Theaters of secret operations were divided between the United States and Great Britain. OSS had responsibility for China, Manchu-ria, Korea, Australia, the Atlantic Islands, and Finland, while SOE covered India, East Africa, the Balkans, and the Middle East. Western Europe would remain primarily British, with U.S. representation.</p><p>As &#x201c;junior partner&#x201d; in this joint wartime venture, Donovan needed to build not only America&#x2019;s first spy agency, but one capable of waging a global intelligence war. This was no easy task. Whatever espionage legacy remained from previous wars was largely out of date or forgotten. He would have to assemble the organization from the ground up with assistance from the British. The United States provided technology while Britain offered experience and counsel, training Americans in the craft of intelligence.</p><p>The blue bloods, so easily dismissed by the society columnists as frivolous playboys and genteel sports-men, learned quickly from their British tutors.</p><p>&#x201c;Ah, those first OSS arrivals in London!&#x201d; wrote veteran British intelligence officer Malcolm Muggeridge. &#x201c;How well I remember them arriving like <i>jeune filles en fleur </i>straight from a finishing school, all fresh and innocent to start work in our frowsty old intelligence brothel. All too soon they were ravished and corrupted, becoming indistinguishable from seasoned pros who had been in the game for a quarter century or more.&#x201d;</p><p>As the British schooled that first generation of American spies, American ingenuity was about to trans-form espionage. Lovell&#x2019;s new R&amp;D unit was officially established on October 17, 1942. General Order No. 9 in early 1943 described its mission as the invention, development, and testing of &#x201c;all secret and special devices, material and equipment for special operations, and the provision of laboratory facilities.&#x201d; R&amp;D was divided into four divisions: Technical, Documentation, Special Assistance, and Camouflage. Each would work closely with Division 19 (originally codenamed Sandman Club) of the Office of Scientific Research and Development (OSRD), which served as their link with contractors in the private sector. Division 19 maintained its own testing laboratory at the Maryland Research Laboratory (MRL), located on the site of the Congressional Country Club.</p><p>At the time Donovan and Lovell were sipping sherry in Georgetown, the OSS in its infancy was already showing evidence of American character, differing from its SOE cousin in subtle but significant ways. While the British had kept SOE separate from the country&#x2019;s traditional intelligence-gathering arm, the Secret Intelligence Service (SIS), the OSS combined espionage and unconventional warfare into a single organization. Whereas the SIS was a civilian agency, OSS was a military organization, functioning with relative independence under the Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS).</p><p>The new agency also differed from its British counterpart in the way it acquired its clandestine technology. Great Britain created government laboratories for the scientific and technical work in espionage, scattering them throughout the country. These highly secretive &#x201c;Stations,&#x201d; as they were called, operated largely independently and with defined responsibilities. Station VIIa, for instance, responsible for covert radio production, was located in Bontex Knitting Mills in Wembley, while a part of the camouflage section, Station XVa, was housed in the Natural History Museum in London. England&#x2019;s best scientific and engineering minds had been recruited to work at these top-secret government labs and used whatever limited wartime resources they could muster.</p><p>By contrast, Lovell, rather than recruit engineers and scientists into government service and build laboratories from the ground up, sought out private companies with the technical expertise and manufacturing capabilities to produce the needed gear, either from all original designs or by modifying existing consumer products for clandestine work. Traditionally clever artisans turned out one custom-made clandestine device at a time. Under Lovell&#x2019;s leadership the new generation of spy gear would be engineered and produced using modern manufacturing techniques.</p><p>American industry and Lovell were particularly well suited for the mission. The advances in science and engineering since World War I were broadly integrated into the nation&#x2019;s manufacturing and technical infrastructure and Lovell offered OSS far more than just management and technical expertise. As a scientist and businessman of the post&#x2013;World War I generation, he arrived at his task with a lifetime of business and research contacts. These personal relationships with executives and scientists would prove invaluable for OSS.</p><p>Producing clandestine devices required a mind-set on the part of the designer and motivation on the part of the manufacturer quite different from other wartime industries. Work on spy gear was highly secretive, specializ...</p></p><h2>ASSASSINS FATE_PB</h2><p>BRAND NEW, Exactly same ISBN as listed, Please double check ISBN carefully before ordering.</p><p><b>Robin Hobb </b>is the author of the Farseer Trilogy, the Liveship Traders Trilogy, the Tawny Man Trilogy, the Soldier Son Trilogy, and the Rain Wilds Chronicles. She has also written as Megan Lindholm. She lives in Washington State.Chapter One<br><br>Bee Stings<br><br>The map-ï¿½room at Aslevjal displayed a territory that included much of the Six Duchies, part of the Mountain Kingdom, a large section of Chalced, and lands along both sides of the Rain Wild River. I suspect that it defines for us the boundaries of the ancient Elderlings&#x2019; territory at the time the maps were created. I have been unable to inspect the map-ï¿½room of the abandoned Elderling city now known as Kelsingra personally, but I believe it would be very similar.<br><br>On the Aslevjal map were marked points that correspond to standing stones within the Six Duchies. I think it fair to assume that the identical markings in locations in the Mountains, Rain Wilds, and even Chalced indicate standing stones that are Skill-ï¿½portals. The conditions of those foreign portals are largely unknown, and some Skill-ï¿½users caution against attempting to employ them until we have physically journeyed there and witnessed that they are in excellent condition. For the Skill-ï¿½portal stones within the Six Duchies and the Mountain Kingdom, it seems prudent not only to send Skilled couriers to visit every site, but also to require every duke to see that any such standing stones are maintained upright. The couriers who visit each stone should document the content and condition of the runes on each face of the stone as well.<br><br>In a few instances, we have found standing stones that do not correspond to a marking on the Aslevjal map. We do not know if they were raised after the map was created, or if they are stones that no longer function. We must continue to regard them with caution, as we do all use of Elderling magic. We cannot consider ourselves to be masters of it until we can duplicate their artifacts.<br><br>&#x2014;ï¿½Skill-ï¿½Portals, Chade Fallstar<br><br>I ran. I hiked up the heavy white fur coat I wore and ran. I was already too warm and it dragged and snagged on every twig or trunk I passed. Behind me, Dwalia was shouting for someone to &#x201c;Catch her, catch her!&#x201d; I could hear the Chalcedean making mooing noises. He galloped wildly, once passing so close to me that I had to dodge him.<br><br>My thoughts raced faster than my feet. I remembered being dragged by my captors into a Skill-ï¿½pillar. I even recalled how I had bitten the Chalcedean, hoping to make him release Shun. And he had, but he&#x2019;d held on to me and followed us into the darkness of the Skill-ï¿½pillar. No Shun had I seen, nor that Servant who had been last in our chain of folk. Perhaps both she and Shun had been left behind. I hoped Shun would escape her. Or perhaps had escaped her? I remembered the cold of a Buck winter clutching at us when we fled. But now we were somewhere else, and instead of deep cold I felt only chill. The snow had retreated into narrow fingers of dirty white in the deeper shade of the trees. The forest smelled of early spring, but no branches had yet leafed out. How did one leap from winter in one place to spring in another? Something was very wrong but I had no time to consider it. I had a more pressing concern. How did one hide in a leafless forest? I knew I could not outrun them. I had to hide.<br><br>I hated the coat fiercely. I could not pause to wriggle out the bottom of it, for my hands felt as clumsy as fish flippers, but I could not possibly hide from my pursuers in a huge white fur coat. So I fled, knowing I could not escape but too frightened to let them reclaim me.<br><br>Choose a place to take a stand. Not where they can corner you but not where they can surround you, either. Find a weapon, a stick, a rock, anything. If you cannot escape, make them pay as dearly as you can for capturing you. Fight them all the way.<br><br>Yes, Wolf-ï¿½Father. I spoke his name in my mind to give me courage. I reminded myself that I was the child of a wolf; even if my teeth and claws were pathetic things, I would fight.<br><br>But I was already so tired. How could I fight?<br><br>I could not understand what the passage through the stone had done to me. Why was I so weak and so tired? I wanted to fall where I was and be still. I longed to let sleep claim me, but I dared not. I could hear them calling to one another, shouting and pointing at me. Time to stop running, time to make my stand. I chose my spot. A cluster of three trees, their trunks so close together that I could dodge between them but none of my pursuers could easily follow me. I could hear at least three people crashing through the bushes behind me. How many might there be? I tried to calm myself enough to think. Dwalia, their leader: the woman who had smiled so warmly as she stole me from my home. She had dragged me through the Skill-ï¿½pillar. And Vindeliar, the boy-ï¿½man who could make people forget what they had experienced: He had come through the stone. Kerf was the Chalcedean sell-ï¿½sword but his mind was so scrambled from our Skill-ï¿½journey that either he was no danger to anyone or he might kill any of us. Who else? Alaria, who would unquestioningly do whatever Dwalia told her, as would Reppin, who had so harshly crushed my hand as we came through the pillar. It was a much smaller force than she had started with, but they still outnumbered me five to one.<br><br>I crouched behind one of the trees, pulled my arms from the sleeves of the heavy fur robe, and at last wriggled and lifted until I could slide out of it. I picked it up and threw it as far as I could, which was not far. Should I run on? I knew I could not. My stomach was doubling and twisting uneasily, and I had a stitch in my side. This was as far as I could go.<br><br>A weapon. There was nothing. Only a fallen branch. The thick end was no bigger around than my wrist and it diverged into three limbs at the other end. A poor weapon, more rake than staff. I took it up. Then I pressed my back to one of the trees, hoping against hope that my pursuers would see the coat and pass me by, so I could double back and find a better hiding spot.<br><br>They were coming. Dwalia shouted in gasps, &#x201c;I know you are frightened. But don&#x2019;t run. You will starve and die without us. A bear will eat you. You need us to survive. Come back, Bee. No one will be angry at you.&#x201d; Then I heard the lie as she turned her fury on her followers. &#x201c;Oh, where is she? Alaria, you fool, get up! None of us feels well, but without her we cannot go home!&#x201d; Then, letting her anger win, &#x201c;Bee! Stop being foolish! Come here right now! Vindeliar, hurry! If I can run, so can you! Find her, fog her!&#x201d;<br><br>As I stood behind the tree, trying to make my terrified breathing as quiet as I could, I felt Vindeliar reaching for me. I pushed hard to make my thought-ï¿½walls strong, as my father had shown me. I gritted my teeth and bit down on my lip to keep him out. He was making memories of sweet, warm foods and hot soup and fragrant, fresh bread at me. All those things I wanted so much, but if I let him make me think about them he could find a way in. No. Raw meat. Meat frozen onto bones, gnawing it off with my back teeth. Mice with their fur on, and their little crunchy skulls. Wolf food.<br><br>Wolf food. Strange, how delicious it sounded. I gripped my stick with both hands and waited. Should I stay hidden and hope they would run past me? Or step out and strike the first blow?<br><br>I did not get a choice. I saw Alaria go stumbling past my hiding place, several trees away. She halted, looked stupidly at the white fur on the ground, and then as she turned to call back to the others, she saw me. &#x201c;She&#x2019;s here! I found her!&#x201d; She pointed at me with a shaking hand. I set my feet shoulder-ï¿½width apart as if I were going to play at knife-ï¿½fighting with my father and waited. She stared at me and then sank down in a crumpled heap, her own white coat folding around her, and made no effort to rise. &#x201c;I found her,&#x201d; she called in a weaker voice. She flapped a limp hand at me.<br><br>I heard footsteps to my left. &#x201c;Look out!&#x201d; Alaria gasped, but she was too late. I swung my branch as hard as I could, connected with Dwalia&#x2019;s face, and then danced back to the right between the trees. I set my back to one trunk and took up my stance again, branch at the ready. Dwalia was shouting but I refused to look and see if I&#x2019;d hurt her. Perhaps I&#x2019;d been lucky enough to put one of her eyes out. But Vindeliar was lumbering toward me, his doltish smile beaming. &#x201c;Brother! There you are! You are safe. We found you.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Stay back or I&#x2019;ll hurt you!&#x201d; I threatened him. I found I didn&#x2019;t want to hurt him. He was a tool of my enemy, but left to himself I doubted he had any malice. Not that a lack of malice would prevent him from hurting me.<br><br>&#x201c;Brothe-ï¿½er,&#x201d; he said, drawing the word out sadly. It was a rebuke but a gentle one. I realized he was radiating gentleness and fondness at me. Friendship and comfort.<br><br>No. He was not truly any of those things. &#x201c;Stay back!&#x201d; I commanded him.<br><br>The Chalcedean lolloped past us, ululating as he went, and I could not tell if he deliberately or accidentally jostled against the little man. Vindeliar tried to avoid him, but stumbled and fell flat with a mournful cry just as Dwalia rounded the tree trunks. Her hands were extended toward me like claws, her lips pulled back from her bloodied teeth as if she would seize me in her jaws. Two-ï¿½handed I swung my branch at her, willing it to knock her head from her shoulders. Instead it broke and the jagged end dragged across her reddened face, trailing a line of blood. She flung herself at me, and I felt her nails dig into my flesh right through my worn clothing. I literally tore myself free of her grip. She kept part of my sleeve as I squeezed between the tree trunks.<br><br>Reppin was waiting there. Her fish-ï¿½gray eyes met mine. Hatred gave way to a mindless glee as she leapt toward me. I dodged sideways, leaving her to embrace the tree face-ï¿½first. She hit, but she was spryer than I thought. One of her feet hooked mine. I jumped high, cleared it, but stumbled on the uneven ground. Alaria had regained her feet. She wailed wildly as she threw herself against me. Her weight carried me to the ground, and before I could wriggle out I felt someone step hard on my ankle. I grunted then cried out as the pressure increased. It felt as if my bones were bending, as if they would snap at any instant. I shoved Alaria off me but the moment she was clear, Reppin kicked me in the side, hard, without getting off my ankle.<br><br>Her foot slammed all the air out of me. Tears I hated swelled in my eyes. I thrashed for a moment then wrapped myself around her legs and struggled to get her off my ankle, but she grabbed my hair and shook my head wildly. Hair ripped from my scalp and I could not focus my vision.<br><br>&#x201c;Beat her.&#x201d; I heard Dwalia&#x2019;s voice. It shook with some strong emotion. Anger? Pain? &#x201c;With this.&#x201d;<br><br>I made the mistake of looking up. Reppin&#x2019;s first blow with my broken stick caught my cheek, the hinge of my jaw, and my ear, mashing it into the side of my head. I heard a high ringing and my own shriek. I was shocked, outraged, offended, and in a disabling amount of pain. I scrabbled to get away but she still had a thick handful of my hair. The stick fell again, across my shoulder blades as I struggled to break free. There was not enough meat on my bones and my blouse was no protection: The pain of the blow was followed by the instant burn of broken skin. I cried out wildly and twisted, reaching up to grip her wrist and try to wrest her hand free of my hair. She put more weight on my ankle, and only the cushion of forest humus kept it from breaking. I shrieked and tried to push her off.<br><br>The stick fell again, lower on my back, and I suddenly knew how my ribs joined my spine and the twin columns of muscle that ran alongside my spine, for all of it screeched with wrong.<br><br>It happened so fast and yet each individual blow was a single event in my life, one to be always remembered. I&#x2019;d never been treated harshly by my father, and the very few times my mother had disciplined me it had been little more than a cuff or a light slap. Always to warn me of danger, to caution me not to touch the firescreen or reach over my head for the kettle on the hob. I&#x2019;d had a few tussles with children at Withywoods. I&#x2019;d been pelted with pinecones and small stones, and once I&#x2019;d been in a serious fight that left me bloodied. But I had never been beaten by an adult. I&#x2019;d never been held in a painful way while a grown-ï¿½up tried to deliver as much pain as she could, regardless of how it might injure me. I suddenly knew that if she knocked out my teeth or struck an eye from its socket, no one would care except me.<br><br>Stop being afraid. Stop feeling the pain. Fight! Wolf-ï¿½Father was suddenly with me, his teeth bared and every hackle standing up.<br><br>I can&#x2019;t! Reppin is going to kill me!<br><br>Hurt her back. Bite her, scratch her, kick her! Make her pay for giving you pain. She is going to beat you anyway, so take what you can of her flesh. Try to kill her.<br><br>But&#x2014;ï¿½<br><br>Fight!<br><br>I stopped trying to wrest her grip from my hair. Instead, as my stick fell again on my back, I lunged toward her, caught the wrist of her stick-ï¿½hand, and pulled it to my mouth. I opened my jaws as wide as I could and then closed them. I bit her not to hurt her, not to leave toothmarks or make her shout with pain. I bit her to drive my teeth down to her bone, to gain a mouthful of flesh and sinew and try to tear it free of her body. I set my teeth as she shrieked and flailed at me with the stick, and then I worried the meat of her wrist, shaking my head fiercely. She let go of my hair, dropped the stick, and danced about, yelling in pain and fear, but I kept my grip on her wrist, with both my hands and my teeth, and kicked at her shins and feet and knees as she dragged me about with her. I tried to make my molars meet as I clenched my jaws and hung my weight from her arm.<br><br>Reppin roared and thrashed. She&#x2019;d dropped the stick and thought only to pry herself free. She was not a large person; she was slight of build and I had a good chunk of the stringy meat and flabby muscle of her forearm in my teeth. I worked my jaw together. She was shrieking. &#x201c;Get her off me! Get her off me!&#x201d; She set the palm of her hand to my forehead and tried to push me away. I let her and she screamed as she helped me tear meat from her bones. She slapped at me but weakly. Jaws and hands, I gripped her tighter. She sank to the earth with me still locked to her arm.<br><br>Beware! Wolf-ï¿½Father warned me. Spring away!<br><br>But I was a cub and I did not see the danger, only that my enemy had collapsed before me. Then Dwalia kicked me so hard that my mouth flew open. It knocked me free of Reppin onto the damp earth. With no air in me, all I could do was roll feebly instead of getting to my feet and running away. She kicked me repeatedly. My belly, my back. I saw her booted foot coming toward my face.<br><br>When I woke up, it was dark and cold. They had managed a fire but its light barely touched me. I was lying on my side, facing away from the fire, bound hand and foot. My mouth was salty with blood, both thick and fresh. I had wet myself, and the fabric of my trousers was cold against me. I wondered if they had hurt me so badly that I peed or if I had been that frightened. I could not remember. I woke up crying, or perhaps I realized I was crying after I woke up. Everything hurt. My face was swollen on one side from where Reppin had hit me with the stick. My face might have bled, for dead leaves were stuck to my skin. My back hurt and my ribs caged my painful breaths.<br><br>Can you move your fingers? Can you feel your toes?<br><br>I could.<br><br>Does your belly hurt like a bruise or does it hurt like things are broken inside?<br><br>I don&#x2019;t know. I never hurt like this before. I drew in a deeper breath, and the pain forced it out as a sob.</p><h2>Infant and Toddler Development and Responsive Program Planning: A Relationship-Based Approach</h2><p><p> </p> <p> <b>Note: This is the bound book only and does not include access to the Enhanced Pearson eText.

She is also the author of six books about cities and countries, two autobiographical books, several volumes of collected travel essays and the unclassifiable <i>Trieste and the Meaning of Nowhere</i>. <i>A Writer's World</i>, a collection of her travel writing and reportage from over five decades, was published in 2003. <i>Hav</i>, her novel, was published in a new and expanded form in 2006.</p>Here, revised and introduced by the author, is Jan Morris&#39;s portrait of La Serenissima, published 50 years ago and still without equal. She cherishes every cranny: the city&#39;s 3,000 alleyways, its jails, its waterways and its buildings decaying like &#39;dukes in threadbare ermine&#39;. She presents its past, its art and its language, which Byron called &#39;sweet bastard Latin&#39;. A suitably respectful narration - with an Italian flourish. - Rachel Redford, The Observer If you are going to Venice this summer, and even if you are not, Jan Morris&#39;s Venice makes excellent listening. Newly revised, it is introduced by the 84-year-old Morris herself, then the dulcet voice of Sebastian Comberti takes over narration. It opens historically but takes in architecture, culture, practicalities (the boats of the fire, police and ambulance services, the rubbish collectors who are slowly creating a whole new island) and the mysteries of death. Morris fell in love with Venice when there during the Second World War, and her accumulation of memories is heartfelt, personal, quirky and enlightening. Perfect for a leisurely approach by Eurostar and night train to Venice, but just as good for whiling away the dull hours commuting to work. - Christina Hardyment, The Times &#39;I was in my 20s when I wrote this,&#39; says Morris in the introduction to her best known travel book, &#39;and I like to think that its faults are the heady faults of youth.&#39; What faults? Fifty years on, it is still the best all-round guide to a city that, despite the ever-present hordes of tourists, remains the most magical destination on earth. Listening to this equally magical audio made me long to go back and check out all those less touristy bits that so enthralled young Morris - the alley too narrow for Browning to open his umbrella, the crypt allegedly containing Mary Magdalen&#39;s finger, the fish market &#39;laden with sleek wriggling eels, still pugnaciously alive, beautiful little red fish packed in boxes like shampoos, heads upwards ... soft bulbous octopus furiously injecting ink ... a multitude of sea matter ... sliding, sinuous, shimmering, flabby, spongy, crisp, all lying aghast upon their fresh green biers dead, doomed or panting like a grove of brilliant foliage among the tundra of Venetian stone.&#39; Yes, the descriptions do go on a bit, but that&#39;s part of the charm. It was written, says Morris, &#39;in a rush of enthusiasm like the splurge of a love affair&#39;. The enthusiasm is infectious. Venetian history, culture, religion, food - she relishes them all, from the glory years between the 12th and 15th centuries when La Serenissima controlled the trade routes between east and west, to the nuns at one of the more fashionable convents claiming their right to supply a mistress for the new papal nuncio, to the notice on the Grand Canal: &#39;It is forbidden to spit on the swimmers.&#39; Don&#39;t go to Venice without it. - Sue Arnold, The Guardian</p><h2>Planets in Houses: Experiencing Your Environment Planets</h2><p>What Robert Pelletier does in Planets in Houses has never been done before in the history of astrology. He discusses the meaning of each planet in each house as derived by counting from each of the other eleven houses, and he discusses the meaning of each house position in relation to the other houses with which it forms trines, sextiles, squares and oppositions, inconjuncts and semi-sextiles. In each chapter, wheel symbols graphically show the seventeen different house relationships delineated for each planet. Finally, Pelletier delineates the Sun-Moon polarities in terms of the wheel of houses: for each house position of the Sun, he interprets each of the twelve possible related house positions of the Moon.

The key to healing them is simple and can be just a short walk away.<br><br>Walking--a bilateral therapy that has been a part of human life throughout history--allows people to heal emotionally as quickly as they do physically. Bilateral therapies engage both sides of the brain and unlock natural states of optimal function and creativity. Thom Hartmann examines how memory works and why emotional shock can resist normal healing. He found that the simple act of walking is effective in treating emotional disturbances ranging from temporary upsets and problems to chronic conditions such as post-traumatic stress disorder and depression. <br><br>Case studies have shown dramatic results. Walking consciously, while holding a distress or desire in mind, can rapidly dissolve the rigidity of a traumatic memory or negative mind state, dispersing its unpleasant associations in as little as a half hour&#x2019;s time. While walking has always been a natural part of life, its importance in promoting and maintaining mental health is only recently being rediscovered.

Walking, like drawing, is a human activity that calms the brain and induces insight. . . . Buy several copies--you&#x2019;ll be handing this book out to friends.&#x201d; <br>--Betty Edwards, author of <em>Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain</em> <br> <br>Our bodies usually heal rapidly from an illness, injury, or wound. Yet our minds and hearts often suffer for years with debilitating symptoms of distress or upset. Why is it so hard for our minds and hearts to heal? One simple key to healing them can be just a short walk away. <br> <br> Walking--a bilateral therapy that has been a part of human life throughout history--allows people to heal emotionally as quickly as they do physically. Normally the brain converts our daily experiences into long-term memories. However, a traumatic experience can become &#x201c;stuck&#x201d; in the brain, unable to be stored as &#x201c;memory&#x201d; and persisting in the brain as if it were still a present-time event. Thom Hartmann explains that when we walk, which engages both sides of the body, we simultaneously activate both the left and right sides of the brain. This allows the brain&#x2019;s two hemispheres to join forces to break up brain patterning and allow the sufferer to release these distresses--from extreme but brief upsets to chronic conditions such as post-traumatic stress disorder and depression. <br> <br>To achieve these results, Hartmann shows how we must learn to walk consciously, holding an awareness of the distress (or desire we hope to attain) in mind as we move. Using a variety of case studies, he demonstrates that it is possible to dissolve the rigidity of a traumatic memory or negative mind state in as little as a half hour&#x2019;s time. His techniques have proven successful in helping to alleviate rage resulting from a domestic dispute as well as the chronic traumas soldiers experience during war that are often locked away for decades. While the physical benefits of walking have long been recognized, its importance in promoting and maintaining mental health has only recently been rediscovered. Hartmann&#x2019;s deceptively simple, yet potent exercises allow us to create our own walking journeys to restore our mental, emotional, and spiritual well-being as well as rejuvenate our body&#x2019;s health. <br> <br>THOM HARTMANN is the award-winning, bestselling author of over a dozen books, including <em>The Edison Gene</em>, <em>The Last Hours of Ancient Sunlight</em>, and <em>Attention Deficit Disorder: A Different Perception</em>.

They seek a transformational, new reformation. Longing for a spirituality no longer disconnected from what their body knows, they cry out for help in changing the relationship to their body's feelings. They search this fresh, holy ground to rediscover their own body within the Body of the Whole Christ. </p><p>By slowly journeying at your own pace through the body-learnings and exercises in this workbook -- whether alone, with a companion or in a group -- your steps in personal wholeness and the body-feel of grace open as one, unifying, organic experience.

Campbell</b>, Ph.D. hold doctoral degrees in the psychological study of religion and spirituality from the University of Ottawa, Canada. This field of inquiry addresses the issue of what in religions and spiritual practices contributes to health and human wholeness--and what generally leads to pathology. <p>Both men are native Californians, born in 1930 and 1935--teachers, authors, theologians, Catholic priests, ordained as Jesuits and members of that order for 25 years as well as cofounders of The Institute for Bio-Spiritual Research, Inc.. </p><p>Their published books include <i>Becoming a Person in the Whole Christ</i>, <i>The In-Between Evolution in Christian Faith</i>, <i>Please Touch, Beyond the Myth of Dominance An Alternative to a Violent Society</i>, and <i>BioSpirituality Focusing as a Way to Grow</i>. Ed's little book for children, but equally cherished by many adults for their own use--<i>The Little Bird Who Found Herself</i>--has drawn numerous sensitive and touching reviews at amazon.com. </p><p>Peter and Edwin also authored nineteen published booklets as well as five video series based upon their psychological research. They have been drawn to explore how a meaning that is felt in the body (a gut or belly story), even before it can be thought and analyzed in the mind, affects human development--especially within family life, education, child development, religious practices and within the world-wide problem of increasing violence. </p><p>During the last 20 years they have concentrated their attention on developing a more effective, inner body-learning process within which those who share a common Christian faith can best learn a new habit in their own bodies of noticing and nurturing their important feelings. The priority here is no longer simply one of acquiring more new information, but including as well how our body can know and expresses Christian faith. This practical, missing piece is crucial for all transformational religious maturation within the whole human organism. </p><p>It took years of experimentation as well as personal use before Drs. McMahon and Campbell felt they had enough experience and evidence that they could then put together this integrated workbook for companioning each person into their own inner body-process of wholeness as their experiential bridge into a deepening faith-experience of the Body of Christ.</p></p><h2>Immortal (Fallen Angels)</h2><p><b>From the #1 <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author who has kept readers on the edge of their seats with her phenomenal Fallen Angels novels, comes one of the most heart-stirring and eagerly anticipated events in that acclaimed series. </b><br><br>The Creator invented the game, and the stakes are nothing less than the fate of the quick and the dead: seven souls, seven crossroads.

Ward</p><p></p><p></p><p>Acknowledgments</p><p></p><p></p><p>Chapter <br>One</p><p>Sometimes a girl just needed a new pair of kicks.</p><p>As the demon Devina strode through the Freidmont Hotel&#x2019;s lobby, she was all about the good feels, strutting it large, hinging those hips. In her mind, her thoughts were locked on last-night action. On her body, she wore skintight leather from her double-Ds to her size nines and all the acreage in between. And talk about pheromones&#x2014;if she put out any more of them, her fuck-me aura would burn holes through the paneled walls.</p><p>Eyes followed her. Men&#x2019;s and women&#x2019;s. But why wouldn&#x2019;t they? Caldwell, New York, wasn&#x2019;t that far from NYC, and famous people came up all the time from the Big Apple. Besides, even though they didn&#x2019;t recognize her from movies or TV, she was still a world-class beauty.</p><p>At least in this current suit of flesh.</p><p>Back to the shoes.</p><p>She was heading to the revolving doors, crossing that smooth stretch of shiny, creamy marble, when she saw the stilettos&#x2014;and stopped dead. Under a Plexiglas case, as if they were jewels, the pair of golden Louboutins was spotlit from above, and oh, the loveliness: The entire skin of each of them was covered in a million micro Swarovski crystals, until their surface looked liquid. And the style? Razor-thin heels that were high enough to put you <i>en pointe</i>. Tiny toe box to show off the cleav. Hidden platforms to provide support on the ball of the foot.</p><p>And the capper was, of course, the red sole, the underside of the heels flashing the color of a candied apple.</p><p>It was love at first sight.</p><p>&#x201c;Madam, would you like to try these on?&#x201d;</p><p>She didn&#x2019;t even look at the man who&#x2019;d materialized beside her. OCD was a disease of capture, and its hooks were once again nailing her in the heart. Even though she had nearly a thousand pairs in her wardrobe, the idea that she couldn&#x2019;t have this particular twosome, that someone or something might get in the way of her possessing them and keeping them, made her chest tight, her palms sweaty, and her blood flutter through her veins.</p><p>&#x201c;Madam?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; she breathed. &#x201c;Size nine.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Come with me.&#x201d;</p><p>She followed like a lamb, looking over her shoulder to double-check that the shoes were still where she&#x2019;d seen them. Worse came to worst, she could always just steal them&#x2014;</p><p>In the back of her mind, a whoaaaaaaaaaa-Nelly rang out. For the past year, she&#x2019;d been going to therapy to try to stop these kinds of tailspins.</p><p>Calm the fuck down, Devina. It&#x2019;s just a shoe. It&#x2019;s only&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p><p>It is not going to solve your problems with Jim.</p><p>Okay, now she felt like throwing up.</p><p>FFS, what was she supposed to say to herself? She tried to remember the combination of words that was supposed to put this out-of-control need into a healthier perspective, but there was a traffic jam in her system of neuro-highways. All she could think of was, Get it, keep it, count it.</p><p>Get it, keep it, count it.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p><p>Get it, keep it, count it.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p><p>Damn it, this was a big step back. Thanks to that fully actualized, post-menopausal woman with the PhD on her wall and the couch-cushion body, Devina had been making headway with the compulsions. But this&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. this was old-school, and not in a good way. </p><p>And yeah, she knew why this was happening.</p><p>It was easier to think about the shoes.</p><p>The boutique was in the rear of the lobby, and as she walked through the glass-and-marble entrance, the scented air did nothing to ease the burn. The only thing that was going to help was&#x2014;</p><p>&#x201c;Was that a nine?&#x201d; the salesman asked.</p><p>Devina shot a glare over. Mr. Can&#x2019;t Remmy a Damn Shoe Size had a good suit on and a silk tie, and his salt-and-pepper hair was sculpted back from his Botox&#x2019;d forehead. Turned out the sophisticated fragrance in the place was his cologne, and as he fiddled with his handkerchief, his nails were buffed to a high shine.</p><p>He was too put-together to kill. And besides, how would she get her shoes then?</p><p>&#x201c;Nine,&#x201d; she said sharply. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m a nine.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Very good, madam. Would you care for a mimosa?&#x201d;</p><p>No, I want my fucking shoes. &#x201c;Thank you, no.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Very good.&#x201d;</p><p>Left to her own devices, she paced around the fake Aubusson and checked out the other high-ends you could buy. Judith Leiber minaudiï¿½res. More shoes, but nothing she was panting to have. Akris jackets. St. John knits. Armani dresses.</p><p>Catching sight of herself in one of the many mirrors, she checked out her own ass&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and thought back to how she&#x2019;d spent the night.</p><p>Her one true love had banged the shit out of her. They&#x2019;d had about eight hours of epic sex up in her suite, just like she&#x2019;d wanted. And the fact that the entire time he&#x2019;d hated himself for it? Icing on the cake.</p><p>Jim Heron was a hell of a lover.</p><p>Tragically, that wasn&#x2019;t the only thing he was&#x2014;and therein lay the problem. He was a cheater. He was a liar. And he didn&#x2019;t understand the concept of monogamy: Even after their incredible night? He&#x2019;d gone back home to someone else.</p><p>And God, the idea that that virgin Sissy was the competition? Now that shit made her want to buy everything in this store. Even the crap that didn&#x2019;t fit her.</p><p>As she started to estimate the cost, item by item, she stopped herself and tried to placate her OCD with the reality that she was leading three rounds to two in the war over humanity&#x2014;so if she won the battle for this current soul? By the rules the Creator had set up, she got everything: Not only did she keep her precious collections and her children down in Hell, but she gained dominion over the earth as well as Heaven above.</p><p>For someone hardwired like her, it was a wet dream unparalleled, a winning Powerball lottery ticket with a jackpot in the hundreds of billions.</p><p>You wanna talk about shoe collections? She could enslave Manolo, Stuie, Christian&#x2014;and get them to make nothing but footwear for her for time immemorial.</p><p>But even better, she&#x2019;d get Jim&#x2014;</p><p>&#x201c;Madam, I am so sorry.&#x201d;</p><p>Devina turned around. Mr. Manicure had come out from the back&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. but didn&#x2019;t have a box in his hand. &#x201c;Excuse me?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;We have only the size eight. I can order&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>The man cleared his throat. Twice. Then he opened his mouth to try to breathe. Brought his carefully tended hands up to his carefully knotted tie. Went walleyed.</p><p>&#x201c;You were saying?&#x201d; Devina drawled.</p><p>A little clicking sound came out of him as he tried to remain composed while failing to bring air into his lungs.</p><p>But damn it, if she killed him, how would she find the shoes in the back?</p><p>Devina released the invisible pressure. &#x201c;Bring me the eights.&#x201d;</p><p>The man wheezed and threw a hand out to catch himself on the Leiber display, knocking a couple of the hard sparklies off their posts.</p><p>&#x201c;Now,&#x201d; she barked, flashing her eyes at him.</p><p>Cue the shuffling across that rug. And the instant he was behind the silk curtain, the round of coughing and wheezing was like an asthmatic in a greenhouse. But he did emerge with a beige-colored box about two minutes and thirty-nine seconds later. Not that she was counting.</p><p>She didn&#x2019;t hear a word he said as he approached, her eyes locked on what was in his hands. There was a temptation to snatch the shit out of his grip, but she wanted to see the shoes on her feet, even if they didn&#x2019;t go with her outfit.</p><p>Although, dayum, Swarovski and black leather was classic.</p><p>Devina hit the row of three damask-covered chairs and kicked off her black Guccis. &#x201c;Give them to me now.&#x201d;</p><p>The box came to her on command and her hands shook as she popped the top and sighed. The pair of red bags with Louboutin&#x2019;s black signature on them were a sight to behold and her hands shook as she took one out and pulled open the drawstring. Then&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. oh, what a beauty.</p><p>The gem-like twinkling was better than those little purses. Better than what she&#x2019;d seen out in the lobby through the display case. And the color was that of Caucasian flesh.</p><p>Jim&#x2019;s flesh.</p><p>She closed her eyes reverently and sent up a prayer for the salesman to keep quiet&#x2014;if he said one thing about her feet being too big, she was going to take his head off, and not verbally.</p><p>With care, she un-bagged the other one and lined up both shoes side by side on the floor. Then she released the structure of her feet so that as she slid her tootsies into the works of art, her bones and skin were like water filling a vase, nothing but accommodation.</p><p>The salesman seemed a little surprised as she stood up and walked around all comfy-comfy, but he wasn&#x2019;t going to say boo, and how lucky for him. Plus, come on, the Loubous were what, like nearly five grand? And he had to be on commission.</p><p>Devina smiled as she stared down at her feet, a flush of giddy relief wiping away all the angst about Jim and the war and that fucking Sissy. All at once she was glowing from the inside out, as if she&#x2019;d had a rip-roaring orgasm, a hot-fudge sundae, and a deep tissue massage all at once.</p><p>These were the most perfect shoes in the entire world, and they were hers and nobody else&#x2019;s, and she was taking them to her wardrobe right now&#x2014;</p><p>That bell in the back of her head rang again, the one that told her when she was backsliding. But screw that.</p><p>The stillies were epic, and she couldn&#x2019;t wait for Jim to see her in &#x2019;em. Preferably while the rest of her was nakey.</p><p>Yup, these she would save for him.</p><p>Popping them off her feet, she put them back into the box just as they&#x2019;d been presented to her and double-checked to make sure the little red bag with the extra heel tips was in there. Then she glanced over at the salesman&#x2014;who was taking a discreet puff from an inhaler.</p><p>&#x201c;Put them on my tab,&#x201d; she said triumphantly. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m in the penthouse.&#x201d;</p><p>When your man went home to another, retail therapy was the only way to go.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Chapter<br>Two</p><p>Standing over a white-and-blue bowl, Sissy Barten cracked an egg so hard, the shell didn&#x2019;t just shatter but vaporized. <i>&#x201c;</i>Oh, come<i> on.&#x201d;</i></p><p>Turning to the sink, she cranked on the water and cleaned off her hand. Which was shaking. Actually, her whole body was shaking, like her spine was a fault line and everything else was in danger of going the way of that egg.</p><p>As she cranked off the faucet, the old mansion got way too quiet, and with a jerk, she looked over her shoulder. Hairs prickled across the back of her neck, warning her of&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. what? There were no footfalls, no screams, nobody with a knife or a gun stalking her.</p><p>Great. Guess immortals could lose their minds. And wasn&#x2019;t that a happy future to look forward to.</p><p>You couldn&#x2019;t kill yourself if you were already dead.</p><p>&#x201c;Damn it,&#x201d; she whispered.</p><p>Drying her hands, she grabbed the bowl and washed the thing out. Then she went back to the carton and&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p><p>Stalled completely. She didn&#x2019;t want to make scrambled eggs for herself. She didn&#x2019;t want to be stuck in this house. She didn&#x2019;t want to be dead and separated from her family.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p><p>And while she was at it? She really, totally, absolutely did <i>not</i> want to have that image of Jim Heron half-naked in her head. The sight of him coming out of that bathroom in the wee hours of the night, a towel around his waist, a wasted expression on his face, was like a billboard in front of her brain. She saw every nuance of his body, those huge shoulders, the tight abs, the tops of his hip bones, and that little line of hair beneath his belly button.</p><p>Mostly, though, she saw the scratches in his smooth skin. There had been three sets of them, and there was only one thing that could have made&#x2014;</p><p>Abruptly, her shaking got worse, and she tried to do something about it by cracking each one of her knuckles.</p><p>Okay, this was ridiculous. You&#x2019;d think, given her current rï¿½sumï¿½ of being a sacrificial dead-ass virgin resurrected from Hell into a war between a pair of fallen angels and a real, live, honest-to-God demon, that the main thing on her mind would not be some guy. Then again, reality had gone wonky on her weeks ago, so could she really be surprised&#x2014;</p><p>She wheeled around.</p><p>No one was there. Again. No one was moving in the house or outside on the scruffy grounds. Adrian, the other fallen angel, had gone up to sleep in the attic where he stayed. And Jim? Jim was on the second floor, doing REM recovery from his night of pneumatic sex.</p><p>&#x201c;Damn it&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;</p><p>Bracing her hands on either side of the bowl, she leaned into her arms. In spite of her rising paranoia, fear wasn&#x2019;t responsible for her case of the paint mixers.</p><p>The urge to kill was.</p><p>And that was only a liiiiittle hyperbole. Because her half-naked, towel-wrapped savior had gotten those scratches on his body from a woman&#x2019;s fingernails. And his mouth had been swollen not from getting coldcocked in a fight, but because he&#x2019;d been kissing someone. A lot. And his walk-of-shame expression?</p><p>Well, that was on account of his clearly having banged someone for hours instead of doing his job. Which just made her furious. Angels responsible for making sure good prevailed over evil? In a war like this? Generally speaking, keeping their eye on the ball was a better idea than being with some whore for hours.</p><p>Or, God, maybe she was a nice woman. Who, like, cooked for him as well as gave him great blow jobs.</p><p>The more she thought about it, the angrier she got.</p><p>Did he have a girlfriend? Well, obviously&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. although maybe that was naive of her. Did men have girlfriends? College students did&#x2014;but Jim was faaaaaar from one of those&#x2014;</p><p>She glanced over her shoulder for a third time. But nope, Jim was not coming through the doorway. Nobody was.</p><p>Hell, for all she knew, he&#x2019;d already left to have coffee with his&#x2014;</p><p>&#x201c;Stop it. Just&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. <i>stop</i> it.&#x201d;</p><p>As her rage level went up another decibel, it felt like an eternity since she&#x2019;d been a college student taking her mom&#x2019;s car out to the local Hannaford for some ice cream&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. aeons since she&#x2019;d been approached there by&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p><p>She couldn&#x2019;t remember that part. Couldn&#x2019;t re-create exactly what series of events had brought her to her mortal end, but she recalled everything that came after that: the viscous walls of Hell, the tortured damned twisting around her, her own pain turning her ancient.</p><p>Jim Heron had ended up down there, too&#x2014;for a time. And Sissy had seen what the demon did to him. Had watched those shadowy minions do&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. horrible things to his body.</p><p>&#x201c;Shit.&#x201d;</p><p>All things considered, she should cut him some slack, right? He was a victim in all this, too, wasn&#x2019;t he? So if, in the midst of this war, the man wanted to get a little grind, lose himself in someone, have a break from the horror and the pressure&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. what business was it of hers?</p><p>The guy had gotten her out of Hell, and for that solid, she owed him. But that didn&#x2019;t give her the right to get all hot and bothered about him having gotten all hot and bothered with someone else. </p><p>Although granted, there was a lot at stake&#x2014;if he lost, her own pare...</p></p><h2>Egon Schiele: Drawings and Watercolors</h2><p><p><strong>Austrian Expressionist Egon Schiele produced a prolific body of work before his early death at the age of twenty-eight in 1918. The oeuvre is comprised of a few hundred oil paintings and thousands of drawings and watercolors.</strong></p> Schiele's oils have often been reproduced and are well recognized. However, limited access to the fragile works on paper and dispersion among several collections have made for an unbalanced representation of his work as a draftsman.<br><br> This book assembles drawings and watercolors from public and private collections and reproduces work from every year of the artist's career, beginning with the juvenilia and early academic studies. The focus means that work that is rarely reproduced is represented extensively, providing a unique opportunity to study the rapid artistic development of Schiele over the course of his brief twelve-year career.<br><br> The book is organized chronologically and divided into year-by-year sections. Each section includes a text that discusses the major events in Schiele's life and the interrelation between the artist's drawing and developments in his oil painting. Features a previously unpublished Schiele watercolor and several works that have never been reproduced in color. Over 350 color illustrations</p><p>Jane Kallir is a noted Schiele scholar and the author of the catalogue raisonnï¿½. She is co-director of the Gallerie St. Etienne in New York.Co-director of the Galerie St. Etienne in New York, Kallir takes the reader through Schiele's incredibly fast development as a figurative artist of explosive sexuality, ending with his death at age 28 during the 1918 flu epidemic. More than 300 full-color, full-page plates carry titles, dates and physical descriptoins at the bottom of each page ("Standing Nude with Orange Stockings. 1914"), but the book itself is small for an art book, about the size of a typical hardcover novel, which makes turning the pages feel like reading the story of Schiele's life, a life inseparable from the decline of decadent, WWI-era Vienna. Richard Avedon has written a short foreword, and in his introduction Vartanian (Andy Warhol: Drawings and Illustrations of the 1950s) makes a plea for the reader to interpret Schiele's vision of sexuality as a kind of sacred message. After a "Biographical and Stylistic Study" by Kallir, 11 chapters covering one year each follow, with an essay introducing an uninterrupted arrangement of each year's images. Schiele's fleet, obsessive, searching work on paper includes beautifully colored landscapes, flowers and clothed figures, and his nudes retain a vital and unflinching immediacy that is perhaps even more clear here than in the paintings. The book deepens one's appreciation of a very overexposed artist's achievement-a difficult feat indeed. <br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Little Ships: The Heroic Rescue at Dunkirk in World War II</h2><p>In May of 1940 -- the early days of World War II -- half a million British and French soldiers were trapped in France.

G. Wodehouse&#x2019;s uproarious portrait of an aristocratic family whose lives revolve around an enormous Berkshire sow.</strong></p> Welcome to Shropshire, England-in this dreamy countryside lies Blandings Castle, seat of the ninth Earl of Emsworth. He and his family live an idyllic life of peace and solitude, punctuated by afternoon tea, long strolls in the garden, and summer showers. Or would if they weren't in a Wodehouse story.<br><br> The apple of Lord Emsworth's eye is the Empress of Blandings, a splendid Berkshire sow who has twice won honors in the Fat Pig class at the local agricultural show. Besides keeping his pig in shape, Emsworth must deal with his sister's snobby demeanor, his brother's crazy memoirs, and a rival pig whose bulk might dash the Empress's hopes of another medal. Throw in a few young lovers and you have yourself a perfect brew of hilarious adventures. Included in this omnibus are <em>Summer Lightning, Heavy Weather</em>, and <em>Blandings Castle</em>. Evelyn Waugh once said, "The gardens of Blandings Castle are that original garden from which we are all exiled. All those who know them long to return."</p><p><b>P. G.

She is a professor at the California College of the Arts with a joint appointment in textiles and fine arts. Sasha founded Permacouture Institute to encourage regenerative design exploration for fashion and textiles. Her work with plant-based dyes and ecological principles through local land-based sources and community has been featured in the <i>New York Times</i>, <i>American Craft Magazine</i>, <i>Selvedge</i>, and the<i> Huffington Post</i>. She is the author of <i>The Handbook of Natural Plant Dyes</i> (Timber Press/Workman 2011).WHAT SLOW FOOD CAN SHARE WITH FAST FASHION<br><br>Toxic color comes at an enormous environmental and human cost. Many do not realize that although we do not eat our clothing and textiles, the same materials that go into making our garments and disposing of them become us. Residue from synthetic chemicals used to make dyes can be found in our air, water, and soil.<br><br>Many of these synthetic chemicals don&#x2019;t break down well, and the World Bank estimates that 17 to 20 percent of the world&#x2019;s industrial water pollution comes from textile dyeing and treatment. There are seventy-two toxic chemicals in our water that originate purely from the dyeing process; of these, thirty cannot be removed. As a January 11, 2013, <i>New York Times </i>piece by Dan Fagin details, our current methods of devouring fast fashion and synthetic dyes have us in &#x201c;A Cancer Cycle, From Here to China.&#x201d;.<br><br>Manufactured fashion &#x201c;seasons&#x201d; move quickly and relentlessly. The term &#x201c;fast fashion&#x201d; suggests that an article of clothing may continue to be functional but is no longer perceived to be stylish or appropriate. Unfortunately, everyone, as well as the environment, pays for the bargain bin. As with fast food, there&#x2019;s little emphasis on the fallout of production or the negative social and environmental effects of rapid consumption.<br><br>When you are working with the plant-based color, in contrast, you&#x2019;re constantly aware that you are working on nature&#x2019;s schedule, not just your own. With plant dyeing, you can be directly involved with the plant and its life cycle and even the care and quality of the materials used to get a successful result.&nbsp;<br><br> Natural color can be sourced from renewable resources&#x2014;like waste and weeds found in by-products of agriculture and even in urban centers. Many plants discarded from agricultural crops are also dye sources; these include cover crops, like fava bean leaves and stalks, California poppy roots, and gleaned by-products, like artichoke leaves and avocado pits, which make rich natural colors. And many everyday waste products from our urban, suburban, and rural kitchens, restaurants, and grocery stores&#x2014;such as onion skins, carrot tops, and pomegranate rinds&#x2014;can also be upcycled from waste bins to make beautiful natural colors and still be composted.<br><br>BIODIVERSITY OF COLOR<br><br>Plant dyes have a rich history in every culture on the planet. The quest to revive the practice of natural plant dyeing relies heavily on rediscovery and sharing information, as a vast amount of practical knowledge has been lost. Dyeing with plants means more than simply replacing synthetic materials with natural ones&#x2014;it means changing the way we care for and interact with our natural environment.<br><br>Natural color is an immersive and fully sensory experience. Experimenting with fallen redwood cones is awe inspiring, from the color that emerges&#x2014;deep mauve, purples, and blacks&#x2014;to the smell of the dye bath, like a walk in a rainy coastal redwood forest. Making your own natural dyes awakens the potential for designing as nature does, with purpose and beauty.<br><br>The value of &#x201c;living&#x201d; color is to appreciate and treasure the inherent uniqueness&nbsp;of nature and, as with an heirloom fruit or vegetable, to ensure biodiversity for future generations.</p><h2>Crapalachia: A Biography of Place</h2><p><p><strong>*One of the Best Books of 2013</strong> &#x2015;<em>The Millions</em>, <em>Flavorwire</em>, <em>Dazed &amp; Confused</em>, <em>The L Magazine</em>, <em>Time Out Chicago</em><br><strong>"McClanahan's prose is miasmic, dizzying, repetitive.

After discovering LSD, they took to Timothy Leary's mantra of "Turn on, tune in, and drop out" and resolved to make that vision a reality by becoming the biggest group of acid dealers and hashish smugglers in the nation, and literally providing the fuel for the psychedelic revolution in the process.</p><p>Just days after California became the first state in the union to ban LSD, the Brotherhood formed a legally registered church in its headquarters at Mystic Arts World on Pacific Coast Highway in Laguna Beach, where they sold blankets and other countercultural paraphernalia retrieved through surfing safaris and road trips to exotic locales in Asia and South America. Before long, they also began to sell Afghan hashish, Hawaiian pot (the storied "Maui Wowie"), and eventually Colombian cocaine, much of which the Brotherhood smuggled to California in secret compartments inside surfboards and Volkswagen minibuses driven across the border.</p><p>They also befriended Leary himself, enlisting him in the goal of buying a tropical island where they could install the former Harvard philosophy professor and acid prophet as the high priest of an experimental utopia. The Brotherhood's most legendary contribution to the drug scene was homemade: Orange Sunshine, the group's nickname for their trademark orange-colored acid tablet that happened to produce an especially powerful trip. Brotherhood foot soldiers passed out handfuls of the tablets to communes, at Grateful Dead concerts, and at love-ins up and down the coast of California and beyond. The Hell's Angels, Charles Mason and his followers, and the unruly crowd at the infamous Altamont music festival all tripped out on this acid. Jimi Hendrix even appeared in a film starring Brotherhood members and performed a private show for the fugitive band of outlaws on the slope of a Hawaiian volcano.</p><p>Journalist Nicholas Schou takes us deep inside the Brotherhood, combining exclusive interviews with both the group's surviving members as well as the cops who chased them. A wide-sweeping narrative of sex, drugs, and rock 'n' roll (and more drugs) that runs from Laguna Beach to Maui to Afghanistan, <i>Orange Sunshine</i> explores how America moved from the era of peace and free love into a darker time of hard drugs and paranoia.</p></p><p>NICHOLAS SCHOU is a full-time staff writer for <i>OC Weekly</i>. His writing has also appeared in numerous weeklies over the past decade, including <i>LA Weekly</i>, the <i>San Francisco Bay Guardian</i>, <i>Washington City Paper</i>, the <i>Sacramento News &amp; Review</i>, and the <i>Village Voice</i>.

A century after it was founded by German immigrants as a farming community in 1857, Anaheim&#x2019;s boundless orange groves were quickly being devoured by factories and suburban tract. In 1955, the city&#x2019;s most famous feature, the Disneyland Theme Park, opened its doors and, at about that time&#x2014;the exact date is unclear&#x2014;a tough young Okie with an awkward stutter arrived with his family to find the American dream.Long before he became Timothy Leary&#x2019;s self-described spiritual guru and the leader of the secretive group of drug smugglers who literally provided the fuel for America&#x2019;s psychedelic revolution, back when John Griggs was still in junior high school, his classmates knew him as an occasionally mean-spirited badass prone to picking fights. He was short but wiry and muscular&#x2014;a champion wrestler, to boot&#x2014;and wore his dark, fine hair slicked back from his forehead in a jaunty pompadour. His piecing blue eyes seemed to be pulled downward by some force beyond gravity, giving his face a somber, almost tragic expression, even when accompanied by his perpetually crooked and mischievous-seeming shit-eating grin.John Griggs&#x2019;s Graduation Photo, Anaheim High School, 1961. A champion wrestler, Griggs had a reputation as a badass prone to picking fights. <i>(Courtesy Dion Wright)</i>When Griggs spoke, he tended to stutter for the first few syllables, a speech impediment that might have been amplified by the amphetamine pills he was known to pop like candy as a teenager. He spoke fast, and the stutter would disappear a few words into each sentence. He had a quick wit and an uncanny ability to size people up. Few people who knew him ever saw Griggs actually fight. He didn&#x2019;t have to use his fists. Instead, Griggs would walk up to a guy he didn&#x2019;t like, usually someone much more muscular or who had a reputation as a bully, and start hurling insults and threats at his rival. If the guy didn&#x2019;t back off, Griggs&#x2019;s buddies would suddenly appear out of nowhere, jump in, and start kicking the shit out of the offending party.Robert Ackerly, a tall, lanky kid with stringy dark hair and an impudent smirk that never left his face, befriended Griggs at Anaheim High School. Ackerly hung out with a trio of brothers, Tommy, JC, and Freddy Tunnell, whose parents were friends with the Griggs family in Oklahoma and who had moved west together. Ackerly was a few years younger than Griggs but best friends with Tommy Tunnell, who, like his brothers, and Griggs, for that matter, was a rebellious, unruly jock. Tunnell introduced Ackerly to Griggs at a party in 1958. Griggs and the rest of the wrestling team, decked out in blue nylon jackets with varsity letters, were drunk and angry. Griggs boasted loudly to Ackerly that they planned to crash another party and beat the shit out of the captain of a wrestling team from a rival high school. Griggs called his coterie of fellow wrestlers the Blue Jackets. In Ackerly&#x2019;s telling, the gang represents the earliest incarnation of Griggs&#x2019;s organizing abilities that would ultimately create the legendary Brotherhood of Eternal Love.Griggs was already dating an attractive young brunette from Long Beach, Carol Horan, whom he would marry in 1961, the year he graduated from high school, a few classes behind Bobby Hatfield, half of the legendary &#x201c;blue-eyed soul&#x201d; duo the Righteous Brothers, whose early-1960s hits included &#x201c;Unchained Melody&#x201d; and &#x201c;You&#x2019;ve Lost That Loving Feeling.&#x201d; By then, Griggs had left the Blue Jackets behind and taken over the Street Sweepers, an infamous Anaheim car club; its members, who met at a Mexican grease joint called the Bean Hut, bounced back and forth between school and juvenile hall, staging impromptu drag races and cruising around in German army helmets, drunk or high on speed or pot, throwing water balloons and eggs at anyone they didn&#x2019;t know or didn&#x2019;t like.Ackerly was something of a badass himself, but not nearly so much as his older brother Dick, a barroom brawler so notorious that fighters from as far away as Boston and Chicago would come to town specifically hoping to break his nose. Dick taught Ackerly how to box. His first fight took place just three days after he moved to Anaheim from Los Angeles in 1956, when he was just twelve years old, a freshman at Fremont Junior High School. Someone who didn&#x2019;t like the way Ackerly was looking at his girlfriend grabbed him by the neck and started kicking him in the nuts until his brother Dick ended the brawl by punching his attacker in the head. &#x201c;In those days it was pure fisticuffs,&#x201d; Ackerly recalls. &#x201c;There was no peace and love going on at that time. It was &#x2018;Don&#x2019;t look at me. What are you looking at? You wanna fight?&#x2019;&#x201d;Through his friendship with Tunnell, Ackerly began hanging out with Griggs and quickly became part of the latter&#x2019;s entourage of street fighters. Once, at another party, they were standing in front of someone&#x2019;s house when Griggs saw a group of older, bigger guys sitting in their car. He walked over and jabbed his finger in the face of the driver. &#x201c;Get out of that fucking car,&#x201d; Griggs barked. &#x201c;I am going to beat your fucking ass! I am going to scratch your fucking eyes out and bite your fucking nose off, motherfucker.&#x201d; Tunnell and Ackerly stood by ready to start throwing punches. But as Griggs reached through the window to pull one of the passengers out of the car, the terrified teenagers sped off.Before long, Ackerly, Tunnell, and several of their classmates were following Griggs all over Anaheim looking for fights. Sometimes they just fought among themselves, practicing their skills by kicking cigarettes out of each other&#x2019;s mouths, but usually they looked for anyone from outside Anaheim who was stupid enough to wander into their town. &#x201c;We&#x2019;d go pile into a car and jump over the fence into Disneyland, then look for guys from the [San Fernando] Valley so we could kick their asses, because this was our turf,&#x201d; Ackerly says. &#x201c;We were Anaheim guys, and Johnny was the boss. Johnny took over everything. People started calling him &#x2018;the Farmer&#x2019; because he gathered everyone around him like Johnny Appleseed. He just grew followers; everyone followed John.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;John was never anyone I would follow,&#x201d; insists Edward Padilla, who also befriended Griggs in high school. &#x201c;He was a sneaky, manipulative little bastard. He would usually pick a fight with someone bigger, and when the fight started, everyone would start coming out of the woodwork.&#x201d; Padilla&#x2019;s family moved to Orange County in the early 1950s from South Central Los Angeles. Although his mother was of German-Irish extraction, Padilla&#x2019;s dad, a construction contractor, was half black and half Native American and commuted back to Los Angeles for work, because, as a nonwhite, he couldn&#x2019;t get a single job in Orange County. &#x201c;I had dark skin,&#x201d; Padilla says. &#x201c;Because I wasn&#x2019;t Mexican or white, I wasn&#x2019;t enough of any one color to be part of either crowd.&#x201d; When he turned sixteen, Padilla, like everyone else he knew, went to Disneyland to apply for a summer job. &#x201c;I was the only one not to get hired,&#x201d; he says. &#x201c;Anaheim was a different world back then.&#x201d;In school, Padilla established himself as the class troublemaker. One day his teacher told him to shut up and sit down. Padilla ignored him, so the teacher grabbed him by the throat and slammed him into his seat. Padilla kicked the teacher in the balls. The teacher went home for the day to nurse his wounds and Padilla ended up being expelled from Anaheim&#x2019;s public education system. He attended St. Boniface Parish School, a privately run Catholic institution, where he scraped with an older student who made the mistake of insulting Padilla&#x2019;s mother. &#x201c;What are you looking at?&#x201d; the kid asked. &#x201c;Fuck you,&#x201d; Padilla answered. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll fuck your mother,&#x201d; the kid responded. Padilla punched him in the face until the kid was lying on the floor unconscious. &#x201c;I broke his head open, so they sent me to juvenile hall.&#x201d;After he got out, Padilla attended Servite High School, an allboys facility full of public school rejects taught by robe-wearing priests. &#x201c;We were some rough guys,&#x201d; recalls Padilla, who by now had bulked up into a muscular athlete. During his sophomore year, Padilla insulted one of his teachers, a former professional football player who promptly slapped him across the face. &#x201c;You slap like a girl,&#x201d; Padilla observed. The teacher slapped him again, hard enough to send Padilla reeling from his seat. He picked up his desk and swung it at the teacher. That stunt sent Padilla to another private school in Downey, where he joined the football team and resumed fighting. When he attacked a fellow football player who wound up in the hospital with cracked cheekbones and his jaw wired together, Padilla found himself again expelled and sent back to Anaheim.At a sock hop during his first year back at Anaheim High School, Padilla danced with a girl who happened to be dating a friend of Griggs&#x2019;s named Mike Bias. The dance ended and Bias and about ten other angry-looking guys including John Griggs walked up to Padilla. &#x201c;You fucked up,&#x201d; Griggs announced. &#x201c;You don&#x2019;t mess with our girls. We&#x2019;re going to kick your ass.&#x201d; Padilla continued dancing with the girl. When the sock hop ended, he went outside, fists clenched, ready to rumble. Nobody was there. &#x201c;I was glad,&#x201d; he says. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t get me wrong. Ten to one didn&#x2019;t sound fun.&#x201d; The next day, however, Griggs approached Padilla with an olive branch, telling him that the rest of his gang was planning to ambush him. A few weeks later, Griggs told Padilla the fight would happen that evening in an orange grove outside of town. He drove Padilla to the location and pumped him with information about who was going to try to take him down. He warned Padilla to watch out for a sucker puncher named Franco who planned to wait until Padilla had been worn down fighting other contenders before he stepped in to finish him off.&#x201c;I rode out to this grassy meadow in the middle of this orange grove in John&#x2019;s 1938 Cadillac,&#x201d; Padilla recalls. &#x201c;There were probably fifty kids there, mostly guys, standing in a circle.&#x201d; Padilla cracked his knuckles and readied himself. Without warning, a couple of football players rushed him simultaneously. One of them charged into Padilla, sending him flying backward. He leaned over and sank his teeth into the guy&#x2019;s back. As Padilla pushed him away, the next jock came flying forward. Suddenly, one of Griggs&#x2019;s friends, who unbeknownst to Padilla had been appointed by Griggs to intervene, stepped forward to protect him. &#x201c;Little by little, even though we had different agendas, I realized I was covered in a strange way,&#x201d; Padilla says. &#x201c;Johnny was always trying to have a gang of guys and that was the opposite of me. I was a loner, but John needed a lot of people to accomplish what he wanted. He was a masterful politician. He had a gift of gab, and people followed John.&#x201d;Padilla and Griggs were both fans of <i>The Untouchables</i>, a television show broadcast on ABC every Thursday night from 1959 to 1963. Based on the memoir by legendary G-man Eliot Ness, the show fictionalized his pursuit of the notorious Chicago mob boss Al Capone. To Padilla, it seemed to provide free lessons in how to operate a successful criminal enterprise. &#x201c;Capone and his gang were so successful because they didn&#x2019;t use violence to achieve their aims,&#x201d; he says. &#x201c;I watched that show religiously, every Thursday night,&#x201d; Padilla says. &#x201c;I wanted to be a successful criminal. My product was going to be pot and pills and I was going to run all of Orange County.&#x201d; Inspired by the show&#x2019;s character Arnold &#x201c;Spatz&#x201d; Vincent, Padilla went to a thrift store and bought a pair of spats and black and white wing-tipped shoes, slacks, a button-down vest, and a Gant shirt with a button-down collar. Griggs and his crew were dressing up like their favorite gangsters as well. Griggs thought of himself as Capone, and his 1938 Cadillac testified to his admiration for the mob boss.Eddie Padilla&#x2019;s dream of becoming Orange County&#x2019;s biggest pot dealer was deferred by several jail stints, everything from indecent exposure to dealing drugs to assaulting a cop with a wrist pin, a steel bar that when gripped in a tight fist could land a deadly punch. His lawyer persuaded a judge to send him to Atascadero, a hospital for the criminally insane, where Padilla spent the next eighteen months. By now, he was eighteen years old and had knife scars up and down his arms and was missing several front teeth. Padilla&#x2019;s stint in the loony bin convinced him to leave street fighting behind him. He married his high school sweetheart and rented an apartment with the money he was making selling pot, cheap weed smuggled across the border from Mexico. In those days, marijuana was divided into &#x201c;lids&#x201d; which referred to a whole can of Prince Albert brand rolling tobacco, and &#x201c;fingers,&#x201d; which was a finger&#x2019;s width of pot inside the can.Soon, Padilla wasn&#x2019;t just dealing, he was supplying pot to other dealers, like Jack &#x201c;Dark Cloud&#x201d; Harrington, a street fighter from Westminster. One night, Padilla went over to Harrington&#x2019;s house to see if he needed any more pot to sell. Sitting in the living room was his old friend John Griggs, whom Padilla hadn&#x2019;t seen since high school. Griggs was now married, working in the nearby oil fields of Yorba Linda and, like Padilla, dealing a lot of pot.&#x201c;I became the biggest dealer in Anaheim, and maybe Garden Grove,&#x201d; Padilla says. &#x201c;I had a lot of customers and went around meticulously turning people on to pot. I believed in pot.&#x201d; One day, Padilla&#x2019;s pot supplier introduced him to someone who was bringing kilograms of weed across the border every weekend. Now Padilla could sell half pounds and quarter pounds of marijuana at a pop. He went back to all the people he knew, turning them on to pot and looking for the next adventure. &#x201c;I was twenty years old and figured I needed to go down to Mexico and do something worthy,&#x201d; he says. &#x201c;Being an adrenaline junkie, smuggling was appealing to me. I couldn&#x2019;t wait.&#x201d;<br><br>While Padilla and Griggs conspired to dominate Orange County&#x2019;s drug trade, Robert Ackerly had taken to hanging out on the beach, drinking beer, smoking pot, and surfing. He and Tommy Tunnell passed most of their time playing hooky from school and hitting the waves down in Huntington Beach. One night, police discovered Ackerly having sex with a runaway girl on the sand. &#x201c;They said it was immoral for us to have our clothes off at the beach,&#x201d; he says. &#x201c;This was Orange County, so I did three months in juvenile hall.&#x201d;Shortly after getting out, Ackerly and Tunnell went to a movie in Los Angeles. After the show, someone looked at him the wrong way. Words were exchanged and Ackerly punched the man until blood poured from his mouth and ears. As Ackerly politely explained to the theater manager that the other guy started the fight, the police and an ambulance arrived. The cops arrested him and took him back to jail. &#x201c;Because of my record, they told me I was going into the service tomorrow. It was either that or stay in jail.&#x201d;The following morning, Ackerly volunteered for the air force, then the army and marines, but was rejected each time because of his criminal record. Just when he thought his only option was more jail time, the navy accepted him. &#x201c;I got busted for getting in a fight and fucking a girl on the beach.

Written during the winter of 1862&#x2013;63, her lively dispatches appeared in the newspaper <i>Commonwealth,</i> where they were eagerly read by soldiers' friends and families. Then, as now, these chronicles revealed the desperate realities of battlefield medicine as well as the tentative first steps of women in military service.<br>Writing under a pseudonym, Alcott recounted the vicissitudes of her two-day journey from her home in Concord, Massachusetts, to Washington, D.C. A fiery baptism in the practice of nursing awaited her at Washington Hospital, were she arrived immediately after the slaughter of the Army of the Potomac at the battle of Fredericksburg. Alcott's rapidly paced prose graphically depicts the facts of hospital life, deftly balancing pathos with gentle humor. A vivid and truthful portrait of an often overlooked aspect of the Civil War, this book remains among the most illuminating reports of the era's medical practices as well as a moving testimonial to the war's human cost.</p><p></p><h2>Hara: The Vital Center of Man</h2><p>The classic text on balance, inner calm, and the cultivation of tranquillity using the age-old techniques of Zen masters<br><br>ï¿½ Reveals the psychosomatic underpinnings of Zen, Taoism, and other Eastern traditions<br><br>ï¿½ Provides an alternative to the &#x201c;chest out-belly in&#x201d; postural attitude of the West<br><br>ï¿½ Includes translations of the wisdom teachings of three Japanese masters <br><br>ï¿½ Shows how the theory and practice of Hara helps us find our essential self<br><br>When we speak of an individual&#x2019;s <i>state,</i> we are actually referring to something that transcends the duality of body and soul, something that reflects the entirety of a person&#x2019;s being.
